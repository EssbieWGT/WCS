The system is responsible for caring for over nine million uniformed service members, military families, retirees and contractors around the world, while also providing care for wounded service members at home.
In March, a military health care expert testifying before Congress warned that without major interventions to fix deficiencies in the system, the M.H.S.
Military housing and health facilities can’t sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait or shoot down Iranian ballistic missiles in the Persian Gulf.
But the administration must understand that future diversions will continue to erode the quality of the Military Health System and military housing, undermining personnel morale, readiness and retention and diluting recruiting power.","For 12 days in June, the United States teetered on the edge of yet another war in the Middle East. We seem to have avoided the worst for now, but there is a chance that fighting between Israel and Iran could resume — especially if diplomatic efforts to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions fail. And pressure on President Trump from prominent interventionist Republican policymakers remains to support a regime change operation against Iran, which also risks reigniting the conflict.

At the same time, the threat of war with China looms large. China continues to rapidly expand its Navy and build capabilities that would enable it to seize Taiwan if it so chooses. We are now less than 18 months away from 2027, the year that Admiral Phil Davidson, a former commander of the military Indo-Pacific Command, once said China could be able to seize Taiwan through force. A war with nuclear-armed China would be several orders of magnitude more dangerous than a war with Iran.

Regardless, the United States still must be prepared to wage a major conflict. And while there is no doubt that the U.S. military remains the most powerful and capable fighting force in the world, it is suffering from systemic challenges in a critical component of warfighting success: personnel readiness.

Even on the modern high-tech battlefield, war is still a people business. For the Department of Defense, this means it must care for its people along with developing its weapons in order to maintain lethality while also creating an environment that incentivizes Americans to continue to serve. When service members and their families cannot rely on the programs that are intended to ensure their quality of life, it distracts them from their duties, which inevitably limits their effectiveness in combat.

A critical challenge the second Trump administration inherited is the state of the Military Health System. The system is responsible for caring for over nine million uniformed service members, military families, retirees and contractors around the world, while also providing care for wounded service members at home. But the system has been declining, and budgets for military hospitals have fallen by nearly 12 percent since 2015. As a result, its ability to provide adequate care to these groups and support the Defense Department in a major military conflict has become severely compromised.

Military treatment facilities currently face a global maintenance backlog exceeding $10 billion, which has led many M.H.S. hospitals to fall into disrepair. The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside of Washington, D.C., which routinely treats presidents and members of Congress, had to evacuate several clinics earlier this year, owing to burst pipes that resulted from delayed maintenance.

In March, a military health care expert testifying before Congress warned that without major interventions to fix deficiencies in the system, the M.H.S. would slide into “medical obsolescence.” Jeremy Cannon, a retired Air Force trauma surgeon and medical professor, estimated that in a war with a high volume of casualties, “many of these patients will have survivable injuries, yet one in four will die at the hands of an unprepared system.”

Military housing is also in disarray. In October 2024, the Government Accountability Office found that persistent housing shortfalls for military families in some areas threaten overall quality of life and financial stability for service members and could lead to “negative effects on performance and mission, especially for lower ranked, junior personnel.” Other facilities and services designed to support military families — in particular day care centers on military bases — are increasingly strained as well.

The Navy secretary John Phelan was apparently shocked after touring barracks for sailors and Marines in Guam in May. The barracks were plagued with mold, exposed electrical wiring and damaged plumbing, which made the building practically unlivable. That situation is unfortunately not unique; the Marine Corps alone reportedly estimated it will need $1.5 billion a year over the next decade to bring its barracks around the world up to standard.

Fortunately, Mr. Trump’s recently passed domestic policy law includes nearly $9 billion to improve military quality of life, with a significant portion of that money earmarked to address the poor state of military health care facilities and housing that the Trump administration inherited.

It is also imperative that both Congress and the administration resist pressure or temptation to redirect this money to other priorities, as has happened in the past. The lobbying power of major defense acquisition programs far outmatches those speaking up for military personnel. The military, too, has had to redirect money from quality of life initiatives to other more urgent priorities. This occurred most recently when the Defense Department planned to shift $1 billion away from barracks improvements to support efforts to improve border security. That mission is critical to our nation’s safety, but there have been times when the Pentagon has prioritized funds to sustain missions less essential to national security, such as the Iraq war, which shouldn’t have been fought in the first place, and nation-building in Afghanistan.

Leaders at the Pentagon and in Congress must avoid these diversions and the pressure to start more unnecessary wars that further undermine readiness to deal with actual threats to our safety. Military housing and health facilities can’t sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait or shoot down Iranian ballistic missiles in the Persian Gulf. But the administration must understand that future diversions will continue to erode the quality of the Military Health System and military housing, undermining personnel morale, readiness and retention and diluting recruiting power.

The individuals who serve in our military are some of the best, brightest and bravest our country has to offer. This was recently exemplified by the dozens of pilots who flew a 37-hour round-trip mission to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, a feat unmatched in American military aviation history. But in order for service members to be successful at fighting and winning America’s wars, they must have quality housing, health care and services that enable them to focus on their core responsibilities.

Abstract MHSRS-25-14329 – Poster presentation:

Title: Quantitate Differences in Lithium Brain-to-Plasma Exposure in PTSD Subjects Between AL001 and Lithium Carbonate

Session Title: Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs

Session Date and Time: Wednesday, August 6, 2025; 10:00AM ET – 12:00PM ET

Session Location: Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center, Kissimmee, FL

Presenter Details: Stephan Jackman, Chief Executive Officer, Alzamend Neuro, Inc.

Summary: The current study is designed to quantitate differences in lithium brain-to-plasma exposure in PTSD subjects between AL001 and lithium carbonate for the purpose of contributing to a composite database of analogously studied brain-plasma assessments that include data from healthy subjects and multiple additional neurodegenerative, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Currently, AL001 is targeted for treatment of Alzheimer’s, BD type 1, MDD and PTSD. It’s anticipated that this study design may help target appropriate AL001 lithium systemic dosing for these indications in future studies. Using this study design, comparable target organ (brain) lithium concentrations may be quantitated between AL001 and lithium carbonate and, by equivalence inference, lithium citrate solution and syrup.

About AL001

AL001 is a novel lithium-delivery system that has the potential to provide the benefits of marketed lithium salts while mitigating or avoiding currently experienced toxicities associated with lithium. Results from Alzamend’s completed Phase IIA multiple-ascending dose study of AL001 in Alzheimer’s patients and healthy subjects identified a maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”), as assessed by an independent safety review committee. This MTD is designed to be unlikely to require therapeutic drug monitoring while providing lithium at a relatively modest but effective dose. AL001 is designed to favorably distribute lithium in the brain resulting in lower exposure of other body organs and an improved safety profile compared to currently marketed lithium salts. This can serve to mitigate or obviate the disadvantageously low ceiling for toxicity of marketed lithium salts that has limited their usefulness to patients and prescribers.

In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital as its clinical trial site, Alzamend initiated the first of five Phase II clinical studies of AL001 in May 2025, with the first study in healthy human subjects. Alzamend aims to explore the unique properties of AL001 and its potential to deliver lithium more effectively in the brain compared to marketed lithium salts. The study in healthy human subjects will serve as a baseline and assist Alzamend in determining the best path forward in Alzheimer’s, BD, MDD and PTSD patients by demonstrating AL001’s targeted effectiveness and reduced systemic side effects. Previous studies in mice have shown that AL001 ensures better brain absorption while maintaining lower levels of lithium in the blood, paving the way for safer and more efficient treatments. Alzamend expects to present topline data from this study by the end of 2025.

Prebiotic foods include apples, artichokes, asparagus, bananas, berries, green vegetables, onions, tomatoes and garlic.
Talk to your doctor about any nutrient deficiencies you may have, as these can affect feelings of stress and mental well-being.
Foods to Alleviate Stress Foods to combat stress include the minerals, zinc and magnesium, and vitamins C, B, and E, according to CHAMP.
Foods high in these nutrients are the foods of choice.","Mental well-being is as crucial to a warfighter’s medical readiness as physical fitness. While nutrition is well known for its contributions to physical fitness, it’s often lesser known for its cognitive benefits.

“Overall dietary pattern is more important than any one singular food for mental performance and emotional well-being,"" said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Tanisha Currie, associate director of Center for Enabling Capabilities located at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

Through psychological, social, nutritional, spiritual, and physical fitness resources, the Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the University of Uniformed Services—otherwise known as CHAMP—has tools to fuel for the fight, guides for optimal nutritional fitness, and a food journal to give you insight into your nutrition intake. The resources also provide advice on what to eat to perform at your best—both in body and mind.

Eating Habits to Support Emotional Well-Being

According to Currie “A strategy that warfighters can incorporate in their day-to-day routine is to “eat the rainbow,” a simple phrase that refers to eating colorful fruits and vegetables which can contribute to your mental well-being.”

CHAMP provides simple guidelines to be mindful of what you eat to meet your mental and physical occupational and training demands, such as:

Eat small, well-rounded meals throughout the day to provide your brain and body with steady energy to avoid hypoglycemia and be prepared to handle stressors.

Follow the anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet, which is high in unsaturated fats, omega-3 fatty acids, colorful fruits and vegetables, and high-fiber whole grains.

Include prebiotics and probiotics in your day. Prebiotic foods include apples, artichokes, asparagus, bananas, berries, green vegetables, onions, tomatoes and garlic. Sauerkraut, miso, tempeh, pickles, yogurt, milk, kefir, and kombucha are just a few foods that include probiotics.

Choose foods for what they can do for you, rather than how they make you feel. Nutrient-dense foods build stress resilience.

Boost your intake of magnesium to regulate muscle and nerve functions, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. Foods like legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, green leafy vegetables fortified breakfast cereals, milk, and yogurt, are high in magnesium.

Eat plenty of foods high in B vitamins. These nutrients support metabolism, brain development, blood and nerve cell health, DNA production, and the development of serotonin, which affects mood, memory, and emotions. Foods like poultry, fish, potatoes, noncitric fruits, beef, liver, clams, fish, and milk are all high in B vitamins.

Fuel your body consistently. Balance meals and snacks with whole grains, lean protein, fiber, and healthy fats to help keep your blood sugar steady. Avoid skipping meals.

Rethink your meal choices on the night shift. At night, your body’s metabolic processes slow down. Eating at night has been shown to be bad for your health, though the right type and number of foods and beverages can help keep up your blood sugar to stay alert.

Be aware of foods or beverages with stimulants or hidden caffeine sources.

Get a caffeine boost, but not too much. Caffeine improves alertness, vigilance, attention, and reaction time when taken in small to moderate amounts. Caffeine may also help mental performance in sleep-deprived situations.

Drink enough water. Water is the most abundant component of the human body—around 50–70% of your weight—so your body needs fluids regularly to function properly.

Increase Vitamin D in your diet. Foods with naturally occurring vitamin D include fatty fish, fish oils, egg yolks, butter, and liver. You can also get vitamin D from “fortified foods,” which is where vitamins or minerals are added to foods during processing to increase their nutritional value. Vitamin D keeps bones healthy and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.

Talk to your doctor about any nutrient deficiencies you may have, as these can affect feelings of stress and mental well-being. Too little energy, carbohydrates, and micronutrients can increase your vulnerability to stress.

Foods to Alleviate Stress

Foods to combat stress include the minerals, zinc and magnesium, and vitamins C, B, and E, according to CHAMP. The B vitamins and magnesium are involved in the production of serotonin, which helps regulate mood and relieve stress. Foods high in these nutrients are the foods of choice.

Also, “foods rich in antioxidants such as fruits, teas, and dark chocolate can help to reduce oxidative stress, provide neuroprotection, and mood regulation,” said Currie. “Particularly, berries offer great sources of vitamin c and potent antioxidants. Bananas, which are rich in vitamin B6, and tryptophan are also known to promote positive mood.”

To alleviate or prevent some of the consequences of chronic stress, CHAMP recommends the following food list to minimize weight gain due to overeating and excess intake of high-fat or high-sugar foods. These foods include:

Almonds

Beets

Blueberries

Broccoli

Cantaloupe and other melons

Carrots

Garlic

Goat cheese

Green and herbal teas

Green beans

Grapes

Kiwi

Lemon water

Peas

Salmon and other cold-water fish

Sushi

Sweet potatoes

Tomatoes

Whey

Whole-grain rice

Zucchini

CHAMP also recommends avoiding the following foods that may add to stress, including:

Caffeine

Hard liquor

Tobacco

Trans-fats from fried foods, red meats, and highly processed foods

“Warfighters can benefit greatly by understanding the basic elements of foods that can bolster their cognitive health and mood. However, they do not have to go at understanding the basics of nutrition alone. There are terrific and credible Department of Defense resources such as CHAMP, Armed Forces Wellness Center, Operation Supplement Safety, and registered dietitians and healthcare providers to assist them navigating their personal well-being journey together.” said Currie.

If you already done that check if they have sleep center at your VA hospital, they have one here in St Louis. They gave me a new cpap machine then a number to call for my supplies. Now, I ordered it online via the VA website and they give me 6 month supply at a time

I’m retired and only go to VA for my twice a year visit with my Primary and get my eyeglasses. Rest of the time I used my TRICARE Prime

I am in a similar situation and won’t say I’ve cracked the code on the VA, but would suggest you keep at it.

Admittedly, not everyone’s VA is equal. I am fortunate that my local VAMC is excellent and there is a relatively small Veteran population. Does not mean I don’t have to wait for an appointment, but rather the level of care and treatment is excellent since the VAMC is paired with one of the best teaching hospitals in the US.

A lot depends on one’s rating, but guessing by your need for CPAP supplies, your rating is at least 50 percent. Which means your healthcare costs are covered by VA.

The process for CPAP supplies is evolving for the better. Yes, you have to call a number (or two) to then leave a voice mail, but I am getting what I need as once a year I am shipped a box with a year (or more’s) worth of supplies. (I think VA has centralized this.)

Medications are another thing that VA has taken steps to improve the Veterans’ experience. I like that they are sending me text messages to remind me about refills.

Keep plugging away and receive the benefits you’ve earned. And than you for your service!

I am retired and prefer to go to the VA for most things. You need to get established with a primary care provider and have the first visit. From there, it opens everything up. You can then have that doc put in for a referral to the sleep clinic. You don’t have to be seen, you just need to talk to them and tell them what you need. That has been my experience at least. The sleep dudes at the VA are really nice but totally swamped. Using the message system on the app or website for your medical stuff is key.

Military families navigate a complex healthcare system that civilian providers often struggle to understand. According to the Military Family Life Project, 73% of military spouses report communication barriers with healthcare providers as their primary healthcare concern.

I've spent years working with military treatment facilities and TRICARE providers, watching families get lost in translation between military protocol and healthcare needs. The messaging templates in this guide bridge that gap, offering ready-to-use communications that speak both languages fluently.

These templates aren't just convenient—they're essential for maintaining the trust and clarity that military families deserve from their healthcare system.

TRICARE Enrollment and Eligibility Messages

New military families often feel overwhelmed by TRICARE's enrollment complexity and multiple plan options.

TRICARE enrollment messages provide clear guidance on eligibility requirements, plan selection, and enrollment deadlines while maintaining compliance with military healthcare protocols.

Welcome to TRICARE! Your family qualifies for military healthcare benefits. Complete enrollment within 90 days of sponsor's active duty start date. Need help choosing between Prime, Select, or Reserve Select? Visit tricare.mil/plans or call 1-800-TRICARE. Reply STOP to opt out.

TRICARE enrollment deadline approaching! You have 15 days remaining to select your healthcare plan. Missing this deadline may result in coverage gaps. Complete enrollment at milConnect or visit your nearest DEERS office. Questions? Text HELP for assistance.

Plan comparison made simple: TRICARE Prime (no enrollment fee, assigned PCM), TRICARE Select (enrollment fee applies, choose providers). Both cover preventive care 100%. Which fits your family better? Compare details at tricare.mil/compare.

Tip: Consider recommending budget planning apps to help military families track healthcare expenses across different TRICARE plans.

Appointment Scheduling and Confirmation Communications

Military treatment facilities and civilian network providers require different scheduling protocols and communication approaches.

TRICARE appointment messages must include military-specific protocols, provider network details, and clear instructions for both MTF and civilian healthcare settings.

Appointment confirmed: Dr. [Name] on [Date] at [Time], [MTF Name] Building [Number], Room [Number]. Bring military ID and any specialist referrals. Parking available in Lot C. Running late? Call [Phone] immediately. Reply STOP to opt out.

Referral and Authorization Request Messages

Specialty care access through TRICARE requires specific documentation and authorization protocols that differ from civilian insurance.

TRICARE referral messages require medical necessity documentation, provider credential verification, and clear authorization timelines for both urgent and routine specialty care.

Specialty referral approved! You're authorized to see Dr. [Specialist Name] at [Practice Name] for [Condition]. Authorization #[Number] valid through [Date]. Schedule within 7 days: [Phone]. Copay: $[Amount]. Questions? Reply with REF.

Tip: Medical alert bracelets can be valuable for military families managing chronic conditions requiring frequent specialist care.

Prescription and Pharmacy Communications

TRICARE's pharmacy benefits include both military treatment facility pharmacies and civilian network options with different procedures and costs.

TRICARE pharmacy messages address military pharmacy services, civilian network options, mail-order benefits, and formulary restrictions specific to military healthcare coverage.

Claims Processing and Billing Communications

TRICARE claims processing involves unique military healthcare billing procedures that often confuse both providers and beneficiaries.

Custom Message Creation Tips

Creating effective TRICARE messages requires understanding both military culture and healthcare communication best practices. Start with clear, action-oriented language that respects military protocol while remaining accessible to family members of all backgrounds.

Always include specific contact information, authorization numbers, and deadlines. Military families appreciate precision and clear next steps. According to the Department of Defense's 2023 Military Family Readiness Report, 89% of service members prefer healthcare communications that include multiple contact options and backup procedures.

Remember HIPAA compliance in every message. Never include sensitive medical information in text messages, and always provide opt-out options. Cultural sensitivity matters too—military families come from diverse backgrounds and may need information in multiple languages or formats.

Conclusion

These TRICARE messaging templates bridge the communication gap between military healthcare complexity and family needs. They're designed to reduce confusion, improve compliance, and strengthen the trust between healthcare providers and military families.

Customize these templates for your specific facility or practice, but maintain the clear, respectful tone that military families expect. Share them with your team to ensure consistent, professional communication across all patient touchpoints.

Remember: All TRICARE communications must comply with federal healthcare regulations, HIPAA privacy requirements, and military communication standards—always include appropriate opt-out language and contact information.

What information must be included in TRICARE appointment confirmation messages?

TRICARE appointment confirmations must include date, time, provider name, facility location with building/room numbers, required documents (military ID, referrals), contact information for changes, and arrival instructions.

How quickly should TRICARE emergency authorizations be communicated to patients?

Emergency TRICARE authorizations should be communicated immediately, typically within 15-30 minutes of approval, including authorization numbers, covered services, facility information, and 24-hour contact numbers.

What compliance requirements apply to TRICARE prescription messages?

TRICARE prescription messages must comply with HIPAA privacy rules, include pharmacy contact information, specify copay amounts, provide refill instructions, and offer opt-out options for future communications.

Are there special considerations for deployment-related TRICARE messages?

Deployment TRICARE messages require family emergency contacts, command notification procedures, overseas coverage details, time zone considerations, and Red Cross emergency communication information for urgent situations.

How should mental health TRICARE messages address stigma concerns?

,,2025-07-26 20:07:57+00:00,kiggans.house.gov,Rep. Kiggans Leads Bipartisan Bill to Expand TRICARE Coverage for Military Families,Not Available,,,,,https://kiggans.house.gov/posts/rep-kiggans-leads-bipartisan-bill-to-expand-tricare-coverage-for-military-families,"“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” said Congresswoman Kiggans.
This bill will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country.
“The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act is a commonsense solution.” “Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families.
This bipartisan fix is long overdue.” “Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts.
Save an estimated 367,000 military families up to $8,724 annually in healthcare costs.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (VA-02), a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom of four, announced her co-leadership of the bipartisan Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, which would allow TRICARE dependents to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26. The legislation closes a longstanding gap in military healthcare by aligning TRICARE eligibility with civilian standards under the Affordable Care Act.

The bill reflects a broad, bipartisan commitment to supporting not just those who serve in uniform, but the families who serve alongside them. Congresswoman Kiggans is leading the effort in the House with Rep. Pat Ryan (D-NY), while Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are spearheading the Senate companion.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE—while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26—is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family—especially when it comes to healthcare.”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may remain on a parent’s health plan until age 21—or 23 if enrolled as a full-time student. After that, families must purchase separate coverage through the TRICARE Young Adult program, which can cost between $337 and $727 per month. Nearly 33,000 families currently pay these premiums, creating a significant financial burden.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country—it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” said Congressman Pat Ryan. “I’m proud that this legislation will right this wrong, especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide. This bill will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. By extending TRICARE eligibility to 26, hundreds of thousands of military families will save as much as $8,724 per year. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

The legislation has garnered the support of more than 35 bipartisan House cosponsors and a broad coalition of national military family organizations.

Supporting Statements:

“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently,” said Senator Murkowski. “This common-sense fix will raise the age limit, allowing military dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance plan until 26, the same age as civilians, without a premium increase.”

“As a Navy combat veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices military families make,” said Senator Kelly. “They’ve earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect. That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association. “The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act is a commonsense solution.”

“Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families. A key part of that effort is making TRICARE a competitive, modern health benefit that supports both recruiting and retention,” said Military Officers Association of America President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret). “The post-9/11 generation of military kids are now approaching adulthood. While media coverage of emotional homecomings offered a glimpse into their sacrifices, it barely scratched the surface of the unique challenges they faced. It’s time to honor these sacrifices by ensuring young adults from military families have the same health care protections as their civilian peers. MOAA thanks Congressman Pat Ryan for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act that would align TRICARE with federal requirements for commercial health plans. We appreciate his leadership and are committed to supporting this important effort.”

“Our military families should not be asked to accept less than what’s standard in the private sector,” said Keith A. Reed, CEO of the Air Force Sergeants Association (AFSA). “This bill promotes fairness and strengthens readiness.”

“By extending TRICARE eligibility up to age 26, thousands of military dependents and surviving children will be ensured access to health care and critical mental health care, saving military and surviving families nearly $8,000 per child each year,” said Bonnie Carroll, President and Founder of TAPS.

“Gold Star Spouses of America strongly supports the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act to end the unjust TRICARE premium requirement for military families with young adult children,” said Gold Star Spouses of America National President Tamra Sipes. “Our military kids already shoulder the weight of sacrifice, and they should never pay extra for the same health care access their civilian peers receive without added cost. This bipartisan fix is long overdue.”

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

As a reservist with the 908th ASTS, she coordinates health services for the 908th Flying Training Wing, overseeing operations and readiness.

""I enjoy knowing that my work contributes to positively impact our patients,"" Hightower said. ""Both of my jobs go hand in hand with ensuring medical readiness of our active duty and ensuring the care of their loved ones.""

Hightower's career began in aeromedical evacuation, inspired by her grandfather, a wounded Army Ranger who was medically airlifted during the Vietnam War. She later became an instructor flight medic, and followed in her mother's footsteps by commissioning as a Medical Service Corps officer after earning her master’s in business administration.

A memorable moment for Hightower was when the 42nd MDG received recognition from the Defense Health Agency for its access to care standards, achieved even with two primary care managers deployed.

""Facilitating teamwork in an already stressful environment is my most proud moment,"" she said.

Originally from Columbus, Georgia, but raised in Opelika, Alabama, Hightower enjoys cooking, baking, and crafting. A mother to a 9-year-old athlete, she often creates items for his team and enjoys attending sporting events, particularly those involving the University of Alabama.

Hightower credits her children and husband for her daily motivation. Her mother, a former enlisted member of the 25th Aerial Port Squadron at Maxwell, who became a nurse practitioner and officer, serves as a role model.

""I am always following in her footsteps to be the best version of myself so I am the best mom I can be for my kids,"" Hightower said. ""She has shown us what hard work and sacrifice looks like while also being the best mom.""

Emphasizing the importance of teamwork, Hightower advises those starting in her field to be patient, innovative, and collaborative. ""Never work alone, and always seek help and assistance,"" she said. ""Stay open-minded, and don't let failed attempts stop you from getting better and achieving your goals.

The general consensus is that the thigh might reduce side effects, if the stomach or arm bother you.","That's fantastic! So exciting to get that approval!

Yes, your sleep apnea probably was the final factor. I don't have the link to the Tricare approval form readily available, but they've got a decision chart to determine eligibility.

I'm not sure what I'd do with the compound. Hmmm. Make note of the expiration date; it's probably 9+ months out. You might use it if you have problems with the pharmacy being slow to fill, but the Zepbound supply is pretty solid right now. I guess I'd just treat it like an insurance policy -- glad you have it, hope you never need it. And be thankful if you only ever need the one order!

When to inject: I've done morning, afternoon, and evening; I have no preference or difference in side effects. I've mainly stuck with Fridays, but have taken it between Thursday and Sunday depending on travel or events or other factors. The paper insert in your box will tell you about shifting shot day. (Basically, every 7 days, but no closer than 72 hours. Just stick with 6-8 days as much as possible, and you should be fine.)

I took mine on a Friday, so I would have Saturday and Sunday to deal with any side effects. My most noticable one was achy shoulders for 2 days, just with that first shot. Many people never have side effects, and most that do have some are able to manage them well with OTC meds and/or dietary changes.

FDA insert: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/217806Orig1s020lbl.pdf

Re exercise: Add movement that's safe and enjoyable when you're able. Don't over do it. If you're tired, take a day or two off. Or more; some people get a little fatigued. But other people get energized; that's been a ""side effect"" for my friend on Zepbound, but not for me, lol.

I think that's what I've got for your questions. Here are some of my other top tips:

Read the FAQ and the Beginner’s Guide; there’s a lot of great info there. https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/wiki/index/faq/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/wiki/index/beginners-guide/

The Beginner's Guide has a great spreadsheet, with a page for measurements. Take measurements, and take pics; they'll help you see/quantify progress when the scale or mirror aren't showing you what you want. Pics can go in a Locked or Private album if you don't want them in your main camera roll.

If you’re interested in free mail-back sharps containers, request one here -- https://www.pureway.com/novocare-rx-system-request-page -- select “1.2 gallon sharps disposal system.” You can also check https://med-project.org for free mail-back sharps containers.

Watch for NSVs -- non-scale victories. It's exciting when clothes start getting loose, you can get off the floor easily, don't need a seatbelt extender on an airplane, etc.

You and your dr should be on the same page re titration (stepping up in strength). Here's the prescribing info: ""With multiple options, you and your doctor can work together to find the once-weekly dose of Zepbound that fits your body's changing needs. Zepbound dosing is increased gradually over time. You’ll begin treatment at a recommended 2.5 mg starting dose. After 4 weeks, your doctor will increase your dose to 5 mg. Your doctor may increase the dosage in 2.5 mg increments after at least 4 weeks on the current dose until recommended maintenance dosage is achieved.” Going up after 5.0 is a ""may,"" not a ""will"" -- many people find a ""sweet spot"" dosage below 15 that works for months. https://zepbound.lilly.com/weight/how-to-use

I suggest you reread the package insert and injection directions before shots #2 and #3. Some people forget to remove the gray pen cap for their second or third dose, and it is SAD to waste a dose. I take a look at the needle tip as verification that I've removed the cap. :) (Not an issue with the vials, of course.)

Lilly has great videos teaching how to use the pen and the vials. https://zepbound.lilly.com/support-resources

Here’s the Instructions For Use, with pics on how to inject: https://pi.lilly.com/us/zepbound-pen-us-ifu.pdf

Here's one way to do the back of your arm yourself: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T26Wmg9_EFw -- I also just kind of ""hug"" myself to reach the back of my arm, but that depends on your range of motion.

You can try all the injection sites and see what you think. I've tried them all with no significant difference. The general consensus is that the thigh might reduce side effects, if the stomach or arm bother you. And the arm is kinda inconvenient, lol. But see what you like.

Conditions to meet to access Tricare The SSA clarifies that, upon turning 65 years old, military retirees must enroll in Medicare Part A and B to keep their Tricare active (known as Tricare For Life).
When both programs cover the same service, Medicare pays first and Tricare covers the remainder.
The SSA has started to actively inform about how Tricare can be integrated with Medicare.
Tricare expands coverage: there are services covered that Medicare doesn't offer, and Tricare can cover copays or additional expenses.","The Social Security Administration (SSA) in the United States has led a major advancement in the information they provide about a program that interests many citizens. This advancement is generating relief and satisfaction among thousands of Americans.

In essence, the SSA is promoting greater awareness of the real meaning of Tricare, how it works, and who can be beneficiaries. Through new announcements, the agency points out that Tricare is not exclusive to active military members, but also covers retirees, family members, National Guard members, and Social Reservists.

Tricare, managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), provides comprehensive medical care: doctors, hospitals, mental health, pharmacy services, and even vaccines, including against flu and shingles. This allows many families in the military community to access a level of care similar to Medicare, but with extensive additional coverage.

The program is aimed at several categories: active duty armed forces personnel, retirees with or without 65 years old, their spouses, children, and survivors. It also covers National Guard members and Reservists.

Conditions to meet to access Tricare

The SSA clarifies that, upon turning 65 years old, military retirees must enroll in Medicare Part A and B to keep their Tricare active (known as Tricare For Life). If they don't do so, they may face penalties and lose medical coverage.

This requirement is vital: without enrollment in Medicare B, Tricare will become a secondary payer, and some services could be out of reach. When both programs cover the same service, Medicare pays first and Tricare covers the remainder.

The SSA has started to actively inform about how Tricare can be integrated with Medicare. They have published guides in Spanish and conduct educational campaigns so beneficiaries understand their benefits. This way, they explain the exact meaning of access and the necessary conditions, avoiding confusion and mistakes in enrollment dates.

Why should you consider this option?

Tricare expands coverage: there are services covered that Medicare doesn't offer, and Tricare can cover copays or additional expenses. Having both programs reduces direct costs for the beneficiary and it's vital to meet the conditions and avoid losing access due to delays or lack of knowledge.

For families with a military connection, this can mean access to high-quality medical care, without surprises or unexpected costs. It's thanks to better information from the SSA that many people are discovering this double coverage they can have without excessive expenses.",https://catalunyadiari.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/estados-unidos-seguridad-social-jubilado_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-07-26 14:56:16.153690

This bipartisan fix is long overdue.” “Our military families should not be asked to accept less than what’s standard in the private sector.","Landmark bipartisan legislation would fix inequity in military health care coverage, delivering direct relief for military families across the nation

Legislation would save an estimated 350,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in health care costs

Today, Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) alongside Representatives Pat Ryan (D-NY-18) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA-2) reintroduced the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan legislation that would extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old. This would lower health care costs and guarantee access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country.

“As a Navy combat veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices military families make,” said Sen. Kelly. “They’ve earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect. That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently. This common-sense fix will raise the age limit, allowing military dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance plan until 26, the same age as civilians, without a premium increase,” said Sen. Murkowski. “Taking care of our servicemembers means taking care of their families, and this bill takes a critical step in fulfilling that responsibility.”

“Military families shouldn’t have inferior rights. Our government should recognize their sacrifices by giving their children access to high-quality, affordable health care up to age 26, instead of kicking them off their parents’ insurance plans early,” said Sen. Warren. “All three of my brothers served in the military, so I will always fight for the safety and well-being of our service members and their families.”

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” said Rep. Ryan. “I’m proud that my legislation will right this wrong, and – especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide – will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. By extending TRICARE eligibility to 26, hundreds of thousands of military families will save as much as $8,724 per year. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” said Rep. Kiggans. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

“Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families. A key part of that effort is making TRICARE a competitive, modern health benefit that supports both recruiting and retention,” said Military Officers Association of America President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret). “The post-9/11 generation of military kids are now approaching adulthood. While media coverage of emotional homecomings offered a glimpse into their sacrifices, it barely scratched the surface of the unique challenges they faced. It’s time to honor these sacrifices by ensuring young adults from military families have the same health care protections as their civilian peers. MOAA thanks Congressman Pat Ryan for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act that would align TRICARE with federal requirements for commercial health plans. We appreciate his leadership and are committed to supporting this important effort.”

“Our young adult military kids deserve the same access to healthcare as civilians their age,” said National Military Family Association CEO Besa Pinchotti. “They’ve grown up through two decades of war, combat deployments, and operational tempos that took one or both parents away on a regular basis. We’ve asked them to move every two to three years, start new schools, and make new friends. Many have stepped into caregiving roles as Hidden Helpers. They’ve done everything the country has asked of them — the least we can do is ensure they have the same access to affordable healthcare as their peers.”

“Gold Star Spouses of America strongly supports the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act to end the unjust TRICARE premium requirement for military families with young adult children,” said Gold Star Spouses of America National President Tamra Sipes. “Our military kids already shoulder the weight of sacrifice, and they should never pay extra for the same health care access their civilian peers receive without added cost. This bipartisan fix is long overdue.”

“Our military families should not be asked to accept less than what’s standard in the private sector. The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act promotes fairness and strengthens readiness by ensuring dependents can stay on TRICARE until age 26 without extra cost. AFSA is proud to support this bill,” said Keith A. Reed, Chief Executive Officer, Air Force Sergeants Association.

“The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) is grateful to Representatives Ryan and Higgins and Senators Kelly and Murkowski for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS President and Founder. “By extending TRICARE eligibility up to age 26, thousands of military dependents and surviving children will be ensured access to health care and critical mental health care, saving military and surviving families nearly $8,000 per child each year. We urge Congress to pass this important bipartisan bill!”

Background:

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21 years old. If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first.

Dependents have the option to enroll in the TRICARE Young Adult program, and nearly 33,000 military families choose to do so. However, they must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium, in a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets.

The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act is endorsed by Air Force Sergeants Association, Air and Space Forces Association, AMVETS, Army Aviation Association of America, American Legion, Association of Military Surgeons of the United States, Blinded Veterans Association, Blue Star Families, Chief Warrant and Warrant Officers Association, United States Coast Guard, Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public Health Service, Inc., Fleet Reserve Association, Gold Star Spouses of America, Gold Star Wives of America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, K9s for Warriors, Marine Corps League, Marine Corps Reserve Association, Military Chaplains Association of the United States of America, Military Officers Association of America, Military Order of the Purple Heart, National Guard Association of the United States, National Military Family Association, Naval Enlisted Reserve Association, Non Commissioned Officers Association, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Reserve Organization of America, Service Women’s Action Network, The Independence Fund, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, TREA: The Enlisted Association, United States Army Warrant Officers Association, USCG Chief Petty Officers Association, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam Veterans of America, and Wounded Warrior Project.",https://www.kelly.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Kelly_Logo_Social.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-26 14:56:20.019224

The counties affected are Piute and Sevier.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator at https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Company Overview

PRIME exits and American HealthCare Capital are pleased to introduce a DME/HME company for sale with multiple locations throughout the US. The company was established over 25 years ago. Most of their locations are on army bases in 6 states, plus they have several Midwest retail locations.

The company has virtually no competitors within the Army bases. Their primary payer is Tricare. Under our current government administration, further growth is anticipated due to potential expansion of Tricare for army on bases.

Financial Overview

The breakdown of revenue by product is as follows: 64% CPAP, 17% Breast and Maternity needs, 11% Mobility Needs, 7% Compression needs, and 3%-5% Home Care needs.

The company’s gross revenue for 2023 was $5,257,336 with EBITDA of $2,550,287. The Revenue for 2024 was $7,042,919 with EBITDA of $1,963,913. Approximately 90% of their highly profitable business is from Tricare with a very small amount of Medicare. If a new owner were to focus on additional payers, and making delivery on bases, their revenue and profit could increase dramatically.

Staff Overview

The company owner, operator, and administrator will stay to advise the company for 6 months after the sale.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.","JULY 25, 2025 – Whether you need to make an appointment, check a claim, or download forms, knowing where to log in can make using your TRICARE benefits easier. Today’s Military Health System relies on multiple online platforms—each with a specific purpose. Understanding them, and how they’re evolving, can help you make the most of your health coverage.

Keep in mind: TRICARE doesn’t own these platforms. Other agencies or contractors do. But you can visit the TRICARE All Logins page for a comprehensive list.

Here’s what to know.

One healthcare system, several portals

There’s no single portal that does it all. Instead, different login platforms support different parts of your benefit. Generally, they fall into three categories:

Updating personal information and enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System

Getting care at military hospitals and clinics with MHS GENESIS

Getting civilian care through a TRICARE contractor

Here’s a look at each.

DEERS and milConnect/Beneficiary Web Enrollment

DEERS is the foundation of TRICARE eligibility. The milConnect website lets you update contact information, check your enrollment status, and access Beneficiary Web Enrollment tools. You can use this platform to:

Enroll in or change TRICARE plans

Update contact information, like your address or phone number

milConnect now uses myAuth, a new user-friendly secure login that is gradually replacing DS Logon. Keep reading to learn more about myAuth.

MHS GENESIS Patient Portal

If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal is your main access point. You can:

View laboratory results

Request prescription refills

Make appointments

Send secure messages

You may also view your health records and appointment notes from military hospitals and clinics.

Regional contractor portals

Health care outside of military hospitals and clinics is administered by TRICARE contractors. Each has its own portal:

TRICARE East Region: Humana Military

TRICARE West Region: TriWest Healthcare Alliance

TRICARE Overseas: International SOS

TRICARE For Life (in all regions): WPS Military and Veterans Health

Use these portals to:

View claims

Check referrals

Find network providers

Pharmacy login

Express Scripts is the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor. Through their portal, you can switch eligible medications to TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and:

Request new prescriptions

Refill prescriptions

Track your order status

Pay bills

Dental login

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? If so, United Concordia is your TRICARE dental contractor. Your United Concordia TDP My Account lets you:

View plan coverage details

Check claims history

View your dental explanation of benefits

Pay bills

What is myAuth?

myAuth is a new secure login option replacing DS Logon across Department of Defense systems. With myAuth, you can use your Common Access Card or a username/password, plus a secure multi-factor authentication method. This lets you access multiple DOD websites with just one login.

Currently, myAuth is used on:

milConnect

ID Card Office Online

Over time, all DOD systems that use DS Logon will transition to myAuth. Until then, platforms may use either DS Logon or myAuth depending on their system. (Note: You must have an active DS Logon account to create a new myAuth account.)

Civilian health portals

If you see a civilian provider, your provider may use an electronic health record, or EHR, other than MHS GENESIS. The DOD doesn’t own these other EHRs. You’ll need to follow your provider’s instructions to sign in and view records or communicate with providers.

Bottom line

Managing your TRICARE benefit means knowing which login to use—and when. While it may seem complex, here’s a breakdown:

Use milConnect for enrollment and DEERS updates.

Use MHS GENESIS to see your records for care at military hospitals and clinics.

Use your TRICARE contractor’s portal to manage claims, view referrals, and pay bills.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.

Remember: myAuth is coming, bringing with it a more unified login experience. Until then, save the portals you use most, keep your passwords safe, and check back for updates as the rollout continues.

For beneficiaries in Bandera, Bexar, Burnet, Caldwell, Coke, Comal, Concho, Gillespie, Guadalupe, Hamilton, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Lampasas, Llano, Mason, Maverick, McCulloch, Menard, Reeves, San Saba, Sutton, Tom Green, Travis, Uvalde, and Williamson counties, the date to receive emergency prescription refills has been extended from July 27 to Aug. 1.

As a reminder, beneficiaries in Hill County may receive temporary prescription refills through July 27.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator at https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

The JBER hospital is a Department of Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs joint venture hospital led by the 673d Medical Group. The visit, part of Ferrara’s broader effort to engage directly with frontline military and civilian medical teams, marked a significant opportunity to connect senior leadership — based in the Pentagon and more than 4,000 miles away from JBER — with operational health care.

Ferrara said this type of visit allows him to see what’s happening on the ground. It also allows him to hear directly from the staff doing the work — what’s working, what’s challenging — so he can better support them at the senior leadership level.

“I try to get out to the field as much as I can because having a boot on the ground, a firsthand look is the best way to understand what happens across the Military Health System,” Ferrara said. “We’re a very large and diverse healthcare system … the mission and geography can be unique. I talk to people doing the work and I get to understand what it is about both the operational unit they are supporting and how they integrate within the community.”

He also stressed his three priorities, or the three “Ss” —support, sustain, and strengthen.

“We support the war fighter — that’s our number one priority,” Ferrara said, “We’re the only healthcare system in America that goes to war, so we must be ready to do that. We must ensure our warfighters are ready to fight tonight and our medical professionals are prepared to follow them into battle and deliver world-class care. Sustain–we must maintain and build on our skills using high-volume, high-complexity clinical material and exposure to keep our teams functioning at their best. Military medicine has a proud legacy and it’s our duty to carry that forward — whether it’s for two years or 25. And strengthen — we must continuously replenish our force with talented medical professionals, from enlisted to officers, to ensure we can carry out the mission now and into the future.”

Throughout the day, Ferrara toured the facility, met with clinical staff and support teams, and received in-depth briefings on the group’s readiness, patient care programs, and quality-improvement initiatives. He also engaged in focused discussions on collaborative-care models, innovations in integrated military-civilian health care, and support for Alaska communities.

“First of all, we must be laser-focused on our readiness mission,” Ferrara said. “When a service member deploys from JBER, they need full confidence that their family will be taken care of while they are executing their combat mission — because that peace of mind directly impacts mission success. You all provide a critical function and service in support of the warfighter. Don’t ever forget that.”

Ferrara, who has experience in both military and civilian healthcare systems, understands firsthand the high demands and the need to work long hours. He emphasized the importance of not only maintaining clinical excellence, but also investing in the people behind the mission. One of the initiatives they are currently working on is electronic health records.

“Now that MHS GENESIS is completely rolled out, we’re hoping to launch within the next year an AI program called Ambient Listening,” the U.S. Navy veteran said. “This will restore the patient and physician relationship. The staff can talk to the patient like in the old days, and the AI will listen and generate notes, so the provider does not have to sit there and type notes … we are trying to reduce as much administrative burden as possible.”

The 673d Medical Group supports more than 150,000 TRICARE and VA beneficiaries throughout Alaska. Ferrara commended the team’s commitment to innovation, readiness, and patient-centered care in one of the most geographically challenging environments in the Military Health System.

“The partnership [673d MDG] with the VA is really best in class, one of the best collaborative practices,” Ferrara commended. “I did get a much better understanding of how they work with civilian partners here, both in Anchorage, across Alaska, and how they cover this vast territory, twice the size of Texas, with only 10 hospitals in the entire state. You have to be matrixed to be able to provide care across this vast area.”

To understand the scope, he mentioned the hospital can easily move patients to the next level of higher care; those partnerships are a force multiplier enhanced by having strong DOD, VA, and civilian partnerships.

What stood out to him most? He paused and smiled. “It’s their spirit. Their professionalism. Their ability to support both readiness and humanity.”

His message to the clinical staff was simple.

“Bravo Zulu,” he said. “That’s Navy talk for ‘well done.’ And they deserve it.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-07-25 15:56:14.723245
