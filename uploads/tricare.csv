In short, this expert panel has corroborated what autism advocates and military families have known for years.","Raising a child with autism can be challenging under the best of circumstances. But for military families, that labor of love can be even more difficult.

More than 20,000 children of active-duty military service members have been diagnosed with autism. Yet for years, the health plan for these families, TRICARE, has refused to cover one of the most effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder as a basic benefit — a therapy known as applied behavior analysis, or ABA.

Families and clinicians have long been mystified, even outraged, by the military's stance on this issue. Last month, the prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine joined their ranks.

In a new 310-page report, the National Academies concluded that ABA is a medically necessary therapy that should be offered to all children of military members who need it. The report went so far as to say, ""Scientific evidence indicates that ABA is an appropriate intervention to support health outcomes for autistic individuals.""

It's time for the Department of Defense to acknowledge this obvious truth and give military families the essential medical support they deserve.

ABA uses scientifically based insights and techniques to promote positive behavior — and discourage problematic behavior — in children with autism. The medical and scientific communities have acknowledged its benefits for years.

A recent review of the scientific literature in the journal Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders concluded that ""ABA programs are moderately to highly effective bringing significant benefits for children with ASD.""

As far back as 1999, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recognized ABA as the gold standard in autism care.

The Department of Defense, however, has been unconvinced. It was only in 2014 that TRICARE began offering ABA to families as part of a ""demonstration program"" aimed at studying the therapy's effectiveness.

That demonstration is still up and running — and currently provides about 16,000 military families with ABA services.

Yet more than a decade after the program launched, the Department of Defense continues to insist that ABA falls short of the evidence standards required for coverage under TRICARE.

This claim flies in the face of years of established scientific research — and now the new report from the National Academies.

Nearly four years ago, Congress tasked the independent committee of experts behind the new study with evaluating TRICARE's ABA demonstration. They concluded that ""ABA fits DOD’s Criteria for Reliable Evidence of Proven Medical Effectiveness.""

The report goes on to recommend, in no uncertain terms, that ""The Defense Health Agency should discontinue the Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration (ACD) and authorize coverage of applied behavior analysis (ABA) as a Basic benefit under the TRICARE program.""

But it doesn't stop there. The committee also finds that the DOD's demonstration program has needlessly obstructed access to ABA for military families. And it implores the Defense Health Agency to ""take steps to ensure that administrative processes do not impede access to care.""

In short, this expert panel has corroborated what autism advocates and military families have known for years. The DOD has deliberately restricted access to medically necessary care for military-connected children. And it has inflicted enormous harm on service members and their families in doing so.

Active-duty armed services members sacrifice every day for the safety and security of our nation. Denying necessary medical care to these Americans — as well as to their children — is shameful.

It shouldn't have taken an expert report to point out this fact. But now that the NASEM has made plain the military's negligence, the Department of Defense should waste little time in correcting its mistake — and making ABA a basic health benefit for active-duty military families.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/59/359214c1-9395-49e1-ad95-e2e92d608c3f/692761879aecc.image.jpg?crop=799%2C420%2C0%2C80,N,0.0,2025-12-12 12:56:34.376327

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997.
“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt.
“His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said.
“I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”","Dr. Mark Rubertone, chief of functional information technology support for Defense Health Agency’s Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division within DHA-Public Health, received the Department of War’s Distinguished Civilian Service Award during a ceremony Dec. 3, 2025, at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. “I'm deeply grateful and humbled by this recognition,” said Rubertone. “Receiving this award is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the entire team I've had the privilege to lead and work alongside. It means a great deal to me — not just as an individual achievement — but as validation of the importance of public health data and health IT in supporting our nation's warfighters.” The award is DOW’s highest recognition for career civilian employees whose work improves the efficiency and impact of the entire department. Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997. This system is critical to execute comprehensive health surveillance on our military family.” Rubertone said the award is “truly a reflection of the incredible team I've been fortunate to work with throughout my career and in particular during the past 10 years at DHA. The success we've achieved is entirely attributable to their expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment to our mission.” Modernizing health data for readiness As functional IT support chief, Rubertone led teams to upgrade tools used for tracking the burden of disease, injury, and illness among beneficiaries across the Military Health System. Those systems helped public health experts study trends ranging from musculoskeletal injuries to COVID-19 and measure the effectiveness of prevention and treatment efforts. The data collected was vital for leaders in Congress, the Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services to set policy and allocate services. “Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of AFHSD. “The impact of these tools on warfighter readiness comes from how they are used to track, interpret, validate, and communicate essential health threats that directly affect the force.” Rubertone underscored his commitment to warfighter lethality, stating, “My work, at its core, is about ensuring our warfighters are healthy, protected, and ready to answer the call of duty. We accomplish this by providing data and tools necessary to identify threats to their health, track injury and illness trends, and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures.” Air Force Col. Cecilia Session, chief of AFHSD’s epidemiology and analysis branch, highlighted Rubertone’s ability at translating complex data into clear, reliable information for commanders and policymakers. “His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said. “As the DHA’s systems evolve to incorporate advances in information technology, he is the vanguard of modernizing and integrating our health data systems.” Rubertone also played a key role in bringing data from MHS GENESIS into DOW's surveillance systems as the electronic health record rolled out between 2017 and 2024. That work helped link information from clinics and hospitals around the world to long-standing tools such as the Defense Medical Surveillance System and the Department of Defense Serum Repository. In creating these tools, “his visionary ideas have been a cornerstone of force health protections and readiness,” said Dr. Shauna Stahlman, deputy chief of epidemiology and analysis at AFHSD. “His leadership shows that when we preserve the past with purpose, we equip the future with possibility.” Data-driven service provides ‘meaningful change’ for readiness The Distinguished Civilian Service Awards are reserved each year for a small number of career civilians whose work has a department-wide impact. The award honors a career that has shown how advanced health surveillance and secure, integrated data systems serve what DHA calls “medicine for the mission” — protecting the force, promoting health, and ensuring the military remains ready to respond. Data, Rubertone said, “has the power to drive meaningful change, especially when it comes to public health and national security.” At the cornerstone of his renowned career, Rubertone emphasized, is his dedication in using this data to help the warfighter. “There's a constant challenge to innovate, to adapt to evolving threats, and to find new ways to use data to improve the health and readiness of our warfighters,” he said. “I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9438883/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-12 10:56:24.105866

Company A, 58th Transportation Battalion, first joined the club in April by having 118 Soldiers volunteer to donate blood to the Armed Services Blood Program. They repeated this success with 121 donors in June; 132 in August; and 119 in October. In total, 503 Soldiers — nearly 40% of their available class population — volunteered to give the gift of life.

During a six-week course, Alpha Company trains Soldiers to be truck drivers. Coordinating a large-scale ASBP blood drive required precise timing, according to Capt. William Breceda Cooper, Company A commander.

“We reviewed each class’s arrival and departure dates to find when the most Soldiers would be available,” he said. “Once we identified the best time, we scheduled the drive and motivated the Soldiers to donate.”

Breceda Cooper credits awareness and engaged leadership as key factors in the company’s success.

“Many Soldiers don’t know about the ASBP,” he said. “Sharing information and having senior leaders encourage donations makes a big difference.”

He also emphasized the importance of personal stories from cadre about times they or their families needed blood.

“Blood donations saved my father’s life in Afghanistan in 2006,” he shared.

Since then, Breceda Cooper said he has tried to donate whenever he has a chance.

The Fort Leonard Wood Blood Donor Center has held several blood drives in 2025, averaging about three dozen volunteers each. Company A’s drive nearly quadruples that number, which Lynee Miller, donor center supervisor, finds very encouraging.

“It’s inspiring to see young men and women donate for a cause bigger than themselves, especially with leadership’s support,” she said. “Their generosity helps many people fight illness and injury.”

The 100-Donor Club recognizes organizations that have 100 or more eligible donors volunteer during a single-day blood drive. There are currently 31 members. Each member has their unit’s name, donor counts, and drive dates etched on a plaque hanging in the donor center lobby. They also receive a Giving 4 Living streamer from the Association of the United States Army.

The ASBP, the official blood provider for the U.S. military, ensures a steady supply of blood products is available for service members worldwide. The military health system requires hundreds of blood units each day and looks to the ASPB to ensure they’re available. The ASBP then relies on volunteer donors to meet those ongoing demands.

“This milestone makes me proud of my team—senior NCOs who facilitate, encourage, and motivate Soldiers,” Breceda Cooper said. “It also highlights the selfless sacrifice of the Soldiers who donated. Their actions show they’re part of something greater than themselves. Donating blood is a small act that can save lives.”

Keep reading to learn more about getting virtual mental health care with TRICARE.

TRICARE-covered services TRICARE covers a variety of mental health services. These include: • Outpatient • Inpatient • Emergency • Nonemergency • Substance use disorder services

Virtual mental health services have the same referral and pre-authorization requirements as in-person mental health care.

Getting virtual mental health care Civilian care in the U.S. Are you seeking virtual mental health care in the U.S.? You can contact your regional contractor to find a provider who offers these services: • East Region: o Call Humana Military at 800-444-5445. o Find a virtual health provider: East Region Virtual Health Network Partners. • West Region: o Call TriWest Healthcare Alliance at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378). o Find a virtual health provider: West Region Virtual Health Network Partners.

Military hospital or clinic mental health services If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, you may be able to get virtual mental health services there. Contact your provider for more information. If you’re an active duty service member, you need a referral and pre-authorization from your primary care manager.

Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience In certain locations, the Defense Health Agency’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, or BRAVE, helps get patients quicker access to mental health resources. BRAVE supports local mental health services with video appointments at facilities where mental health services may be in short supply.

BRAVE is primarily for active duty service members. Overseas, it’s also available to adult active duty family members. BRAVE began with 16 military hospitals and clinics and has since expanded to 84 locations in the U.S., Europe, and Indo-Pacific, with plans to add more.

Overseas Do you live outside the U.S.? You can still use virtual mental health services if: • The care is a TRICARE-covered benefit and is appropriate for virtual health. • The country where you get care allows virtual health. • The provider is TRICARE-authorized and has a license to practice in the country where you get care. (Note: U.S.-based providers aren’t eligible to provide virtual health visits overseas.) • The provider knows your location and how to contact help in a medical or mental health emergency. • The provider follows all local health care and virtual health rules.

TRICARE will cover your virtual health care if you meet these requirements. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center to see if you need a referral and to find a provider who offers virtual visits.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare Do you have TRICARE For Life? You may have heard that Medicare has recently changed its virtual health coverage. As of Oct. 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) for most virtual health services. However, you can still get virtual mental health services (including substance use disorder services) from your home.

Remember to check what Medicare and TRICARE cover before scheduling an appointment. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover a service.

What you need To use virtual mental health services, you need: • A computer or smartphone (for video care) • A telephone (for telephone-only care) • A secure phone or internet connection • Referrals or pre-authorizations (if required)

Costs Virtual health costs are similar to in-person costs. Your costs depend on who you are, your health plan, and your type of appointment. Note that you’ll need to pay your usual cost-shares and copayments for virtual visits.

TRICARE remains committed to helping you unlock your health through accessible mental health care options for you and your family members.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9437224/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 16:56:28.788846

Early fleet deployment strengthens operational readiness and accelerates the Navy’s transition to next-generation medical technology.

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The USS Carney (DDG 64) has officially gone live with T6 Health Systems’ OpMed Care Delivery Platform (CDP), marking a significant advancement in the Navy’s modernization of shipboard medical technology. The new commercial off-the-shelf solution replaces a longstanding electronic health record system and introduces a more agile, mission-ready capability designed to support the realities of care in maritime and contested environments.

As one of the Navy’s earliest implementation sites, Carney will play a critical role in shaping the evolution of OpMed CDP across the fleet. Feedback from medical personnel and operational users will drive rapid refinement cycles and guide deployment strategy as the Navy scales a more resilient, data-driven approach to operational medicine.

OpMed CDP is engineered to provide care teams with a clear, real-time operating picture -streamlining documentation, integrating essential clinical data, sharpening decision making, and enabling health information to move seamlessly with the patient. These advances strengthen readiness and improve continuity of care in the dynamic scenarios faced by sailors and medical staff underway.

""The Navy operates in some of the most demanding environments in the world, and sailors deserve medical technology built for that mission,” said Igor Muravyov, Chief Operating Officer at T6 Health Systems. “The USS Carney’s deployment of OpMed CDP reflects the Department of War’s commitment to modernizing shipboard medicine and ensuring that warfighters have the most advanced technologies to enhance lethality of our forces everywhere.”

The deployment aboard Carney adds to a period of significant growth and momentum for T6 Health Systems. In recent weeks, T6’s technology has gone live at the White House, Brooke Army Medical Center and Al Dhafra Air Base - demonstrating the platform’s versatility across global operational and executive care environments. The company was also recently awarded a multi-year agreement with the Defense Health Agency and PEO DHMS to further configure its commercial offering as a secure, cloud-enabled capability supporting the next generation of operational medicine. These milestones underscore T6’s expanding role as a key technology partner in advancing modern, interoperable solutions across the Military Health System.

A GOP-issued summary of the legislation says the NDAA authorizes $291 billion for maintenance and operations; $234 billion for military personnel and health care; $162 billion for procurement; $146 billion for research and development; $34 billion for nuclear defense programs; and $20 billion for military construction and family housing.
That includes over $2.7 billion in essential military construction projects and expands in that region.
It permanently repeals all existing Defense Department diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices, programs, training and activities, as well as future DEI-related endeavors.
It cuts climate change-related programs at the Defense Department.","The $900 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday in bipartisan fashion. The final version includes and also left out key provisions after months of negotiations by lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

The 3,086-page bill passed the House on a 312-112 vote (115 Democrats, 197 Republicans voted in favor) with Republicans and Democrats finding enough common ground to forward the legislation to the Senate—where it is expected to pass the GOP-controlled chamber and then be signed by President Donald Trump.

This year’s NDAA, passed annually by Congress, appropriates large amounts of funding that will impact the departments of Defense and Energy, health care, troops and salaries, research and development, immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, collective bargaining, and diversity initiatives. Not all lawmakers got what they wanted but high-ranking committee members expressed mostly positive sentiments after the bill’s passing.

“This is a strong bipartisan bill that delivers for our warfighters and deters our adversaries,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) said on the House floor prior to the bill’s passing. “It will fundamentally reform the defense acquisition enterprise. It will continue historic improvements in the quality of life for our servicemembers and their families.

“It will build the ready, capable, and lethal fighting force we need to deter China and our other adversaries. And it will deliver on President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda. I urge all members to support it.”

Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), the ranking Democrat on the committee, called the bill “the most ambitious swing at acquisition reform that we’ve taken,” according to the Associated Press.

“This NDAA falls short. Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth are deploying troops to our streets, carrying out extrajudicial killings, and undermining our military readiness. Congress must reassert its oversight. We need accountability—not just handouts to Trump,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA), a senior Armed Services Committee member, in a post on X.

Big Money

The House-passed bill in part authorizes some military construction projects and extends their authorization from previous fiscal years; requires the Department of Defense to develop a national strategy on the security implications of emerging biotechnologies; requires the Navy to implement certain processes to improve combat readiness of surface ships maintained and repaired at private shipyards; and extends the Pacific Deterrence Initiative which designed to enhance U.S. deterrence and defense posture in the Indo-Pacific region.

A GOP-issued summary of the legislation says the NDAA authorizes $291 billion for maintenance and operations; $234 billion for military personnel and health care; $162 billion for procurement; $146 billion for research and development; $34 billion for nuclear defense programs; and $20 billion for military construction and family housing.

Lawmakers say the FY 2026 bill overall will save taxpayers nearly $20 billion, including $40.5 million from eliminating DEI activities; $1.6 billion in cuts to climate change-related spending; $1.2 billion from retiring obsolete aircraft and ships; $6.8 billion from reductions in “unnecessary Pentagon bureaucracy”; $5.5 billion in cuts to consulting and service contracts; and $3.7 billion in cuts to inefficient defense programs.

NDAA’s Major Inclusions

Some of the NDAA’s major highlights are as follows:

A 3.8% pay raise for all military servicemembers, in addition to reauthorizing and expanding military bonuses and special pays; increases family separation allowance for deployed servicemembers; and requires a study to improve the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing to ensure it keeps up with rising rental costs.

$400 million for Ukraine security assistance.

It extends the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) to improve U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific region, including funding increases for new technologies needed to deter China such as hypersonic missiles, AI, autonomous systems, cyber, mobile micronuclear reactors, and high energy lasers. That includes over $2.7 billion in essential military construction projects and expands in that region.

Full funding ($1 billion) towards the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative.

$1.5 billion in new security assistance for the Philippines.

It formally establishes and authorizes $175 million for the Baltic Security Initiative to strengthen the defensive capability and interoperability of the Baltic states.

Full funding for the deployment of National Guard and active-duty troops in support of border patrol at the United States’ southwest border, including over $1 billion to fight drug trafficking ($398 million for Defense Department support of counter-narcotics operations and $216 million for National Guard counter-drug programs—$100 million over the budget request).

Reforms to military construction that costs 35% more on average than commercial construction, including accelerating construction and reducing costs by granting military departments multiyear contracting authority and authorizing the use of accelerated design-build and progressive design-build contracting methods to cut costs and speed up projects.

Oversight of Defense Department spending by way of fully funding the department’s Inspector General audit activities and requiring the department to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the status of balances and activities of funds previously approved within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year.

More than $131 million for the construction of new military dining facilities and over $1.5 billion for new construction of barracks and family housing.

More than $335 million to renovate military hospitals and build new medical facilities, which includes better access to specialty care by lowering the threshold for travel reimbursement for medical appointments from 100 to 75 miles.

More than $491 million to design and build new childcare centers, including annual reviews of childcare costs and a pilot program to increase childcare financial assistance in high-cost areas.

More than $206 million to build new schools for children of servicemembers and allows National Guard and reserve members called to active duty to enroll their children in Defense Department schools. It also authorizes $50 million in Impact Aid assistance to public schools with military dependent students, and an additional $20 million in assistance to local schools teaching children with severe disabilities.

It extends military recruitment bonuses.

It prohibits the retirement of certain F-15E, A-10, C-130, E-3, RQ-4, and Grey Eagle aircraft, as well as the closure of the E-7A Wedgetail production line.

$26 billion in shipbuilding funding for the construction and support of numerous vessels including the third Columbia-class Ballistic Missile Submarine, one Virginia-class Submarine, one anti-submarine warfare auxiliary ship, and future procurements.

More than $38 billion for the development, procurement or modification of aircraft including full funding for the U.S. Air Force’s F-47 and Navy’s F/A-XX 6th Generation Aircraft programs.

Builds the “Golden Dome” to update national missile defense policy.

What's Not in the Bill

Some of what was excluded in the final version are as follows:

The final bill ultimately did not include a provision mandating health care coverage for assisted reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty service members. As previously reported by Military.com, some Democrats and numerous reproductive organizations warned prior to the final version that its removal would prevent the expansion of IVF access to all servicemembers due to current insurance plans through TRICARE.

It permanently repeals all existing Defense Department diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices, programs, training and activities, as well as future DEI-related endeavors.

It cuts climate change-related programs at the Defense Department.

It removes Section 1110, the bipartisan House provision that would have restored collective bargaining rights for the Defense Department’s civilian workforce and would have prevented the department from using the bill’s funds to enforce an executive order that strips collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of DoD civilians.

Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO), urged GOP colleagues in November to strip the provision from the final call, saying in an X post that it was “designed to stop union bosses from slowing down critical defense operations by pushing ineffective policies that hurt productivity” and would cause “political interference.”

Hegseth’s Travel Budget Tied to Caribbean Boat Strikes

The House-passed version also includes a provision to withhold a quarter of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget until the Pentagon provides Congress with unedited videos of Caribbean airstrikes against alleged drug smuggling boats, according to reports.

It was included on the heels of the ongoing controversy surrounding orders to allegedly kill two survivors from a Sept. 2 strike, and further investigations by GOP-led House and Senate committees into whether that second strike was properly authorized and amounted to war crimes. The investigations remain ongoing.

Codifying Trump's Executive Orders

The NDAA also codifies all or parts of 15 executive orders issued by President Trump, including the following:

Restoring America's Fighting Force (EO 14185)

Ending Radical and Wasteful Government Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Programs and Preferencing (EO 14151)

Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border (Proclamation 10886)

Securing Our Borders (EO 14165)

Clarifying the Military's Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the U.S. (EO 14167)

Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base (EO 14265)

Building the Golden Dome for America (EO 14186)

Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security (EO 14299)

Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty (EO 14305)

Unleashing American Drone Dominance (EO 14307)

BETHESDA, Md. – Walter Reed National Military Medical Center’s new approach to medical care begins with Walter’s Way and continues with the voices of those who use it every day. This model is transforming the patient and staff experience through improved flexibility, easier access to care, and a renewed focus on whole-person wellness.

Several clinical departments, including Primary Care, Pediatrics, and Dermatology, have already adopted the Walter’s Way model. As these areas shift to more proactive care, they are also implementing new tools to gather direct feedback from patients and staff. This feedback is a cornerstone of Walter’s Way by helping teams evaluate what is working well, identifying opportunities for improvements, and strengthening the overall care experience.

To support continuous improvement, a dedicated Walter’s Way feedback form is now available for patients and families to share their experiences. Whether the feedback highlights success, points out a challenge, or suggests a new idea, every response plays a meaningful role in shaping the future of patient care at Walter Reed.

“We've had some positive feedback,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Simmons, Deputy Director for the Department of Medicine and Primary Care lead for Walter’s Way. “Families have even written in, or patients have written in comments to give great feedback about some of our Walter’s Way staff.”

As the hospital continues to refine and expand Walter’s Way, leadership remains committed to transparency, patient-centered care, and open communication. All patients and staff are encouraged to stay engaged, share insights, and help guide the evolution of this model.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 14:56:27.278130

TRICARE currently does not cover IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies.

The provision’s elimination mirrored a similar removal from last year’s defense bill and came amid opposition from pro-life advocates, who argued that standard IVF practices involve the creation and destruction of human embryos, making taxpayer funding unethical. The industry has faced criticism for operating with little oversight, leading to the discard of tens of thousands of so-called “excess” embryos annually – essentially human beings who are killed.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., drew credit from conservative groups for blocking the measure, which some Senate Republicans had labeled a “poison pill” during negotiations.

“This victory shows us a sensitivity to that,” said Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, referring to widespread moral concerns about IVF. “The people I’ve talked to in the administration have said very explicitly, you know, these concerns have been heard, these moral concerns.”

Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy for Students for Life of America, called the removal a step toward better alternatives. “IVF is not an industry that deserves blanket support and funding. We can do better,” she said.

Hamrick added that the process destroys “far more lives than are allowed to live and thrive,” and that “more pre-born lives are lost in IVF than abortion.”

“Unquestioning financial support props up an industry known to prey on people’s hopes for a child while ending many lives,” Hamrick said. “The move to pull the funding for IVF will free up resources to seek better answers.”

Lila Rose, president of Live Action, thanked Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

The bill’s passage caps a year of debate over fertility coverage, fueled in part by campaign pledges including one from President-elect Donald Trump to expand IVF access nationwide. Pro-life groups framed the removal not as a setback for military families but as a principled choice to prioritize methods that avoid embryo destruction.",https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/senate4.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 14:56:31.791214

The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

The new commercial off-the-shelf solution replaces a longstanding electronic health record system and introduces a more agile, mission-ready capability designed to support the realities of care in maritime and contested environments.

As one of the Navy’s earliest implementation sites, Carney will play a critical role in shaping the evolution of OpMed CDP across the fleet. Feedback from medical personnel and operational users will drive rapid refinement cycles and guide deployment strategy as the Navy scales a more resilient, data-driven approach to operational medicine.

OpMed CDP is engineered to provide care teams with a clear, real-time operating picture -streamlining documentation, integrating essential clinical data, sharpening decision making, and enabling health information to move seamlessly with the patient. These advances strengthen readiness and improve continuity of care in the dynamic scenarios faced by sailors and medical staff underway.

""The Navy operates in some of the most demanding environments in the world, and sailors deserve medical technology built for that mission,” said Igor Muravyov, Chief Operating Officer at T6 Health Systems. “The USS Carney’s deployment of OpMed CDP reflects the Department of War’s commitment to modernizing shipboard medicine and ensuring that warfighters have the most advanced technologies to enhance lethality of our forces everywhere.”

The deployment aboard Carney adds to a period of significant growth and momentum for T6 Health Systems. In recent weeks, T6’s technology has gone live at the White House, Brooke Army Medical Center and Al Dhafra Air Base - demonstrating the platform’s versatility across global operational and executive care environments. The company was also recently awarded a multi-year agreement with the Defense Health Agency and PEO DHMS to further configure its commercial offering as a secure, cloud-enabled capability supporting the next generation of operational medicine. These milestones underscore T6’s expanding role as a key technology partner in advancing modern, interoperable solutions across the Military Health System.

""Today, I once again voted against passage of the Republican’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). While I support several important components of this legislation, I could not in good conscience vote for the bill in its entirety. The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $890 billion in additional Pentagon spending. That is $8 billion more than the Pentagon itself said it needed. Our greatest security threats have no military solutions, and it is time our budget reflects that. We must instead make the investments in health care, education, housing, clean air and water, and public transit that Americans deserve.

“Further, this legislation removed House-passed provisions that would lead to In vitro fertilization (IVF) coverage under TRICARE and restore collective bargaining rights to civilian employees. I was also discouraged to see that the bill still discriminates against the transgender community. With this year’s illegal military strikes against innocent boats in the Caribbean, the last thing we need to do is give the Pentagon even more power.

""Although I opposed this bill, there were several bright spots, including a 3.8% pay raise for all service members, the repeal of the 1991 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), and a new requirement for military personnel to display the name of the military service they are affiliated with when supporting civilian law enforcement activities in our communities.

Washington, D.C. — Today, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (VA-02) secured a number of wins for military families, shipyard workers, and Hampton Roads.

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $900.6 billion for national defense discretionary programs, strengthening America’s military while saving taxpayers nearly $20 billion through targeted cuts to wasteful spending and bureaucracy. It fully carries out President Trump’s “Peace Through Strength” agenda by rebuilding readiness, revitalizing the defense industrial base, securing the border, and improving quality of life for servicemembers and their families.

“Today’s legislation is a major win for our Armed Forces and for the men and women who risk their lives every day for our freedom,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “This NDAA makes our military more ready, more capable, and more lethal—while finally delivering the quality-of-life improvements our servicemembers and their families deserve.”

“As a Navy veteran, Navy spouse, and Navy mom, I am especially proud that this bill supports a 3.8% pay raise for our troops, invests over $1.5 billion in new housing, nearly $500 million in childcare centers, and more than $335 million to improve military hospitals and clinics,” Kiggans continued. “It strengthens TRICARE, improves mental health access, boosts childcare assistance, and helps military kids succeed in school.”

“This NDAA also delivers on our commitment to ‘Peace Through Strength’ by investing $26 billion in shipbuilding; over $25 billion to rebuild our munitions stockpiles; and more than $145 billion in cutting-edge research and development—including hypersonics, AI, unmanned systems, and new space capabilities,” she added. “It removes China from our supply chains, supports Israel’s security, secures our southern border, and makes sure our allies pay more for their own defense.”

“I came to Congress on a mission to rebuild our Navy, revitalize our shipyards, and take care of our all-volunteer force,” Kiggans concluded. “This bill moves us decisively in that direction. It strengthens our industrial base, advances American shipbuilding, and improves day-to-day life for our servicemembers and their families—especially those stationed in Hampton Roads and across coastal Virginia. As a third-generation veteran, I will always be the loudest voice for our military men and women in Congress.”

Highlights of this legislation are included but not limited to:

Implementing President Trump’s Peace Through Strength Agenda

Authorizes $900.6 billion in total national defense discretionary spending while saving nearly $20 billion through targeted cuts to wasteful climate programs, duplicative bureaucracy, inefficient contracts, and obsolete platforms.

Codifies all or parts of 15 of President Trump’s national security executive orders—including those restoring America’s fighting force, ending wasteful DEI programs, securing the border, modernizing defense acquisitions, deploying advanced nuclear energy, and unleashing American drone dominance.

Fully supports President Trump’s priority programs, including the Golden Dome missile defense initiative, next-generation fighter aircraft, submarines, warships, advanced munitions, and autonomous systems.

Improving Quality of Life for Servicemembers and Civilian Mariners

Supports a 3.8% pay raise for all servicemembers, reauthorizes and expands bonuses and special pays, increases Family Separation Allowance, and expands convalescent leave.

Authorizes more than $335 million to renovate military hospitals and build new medical facilities, prevents reductions in uniformed medical billets, improves specialty-care travel reimbursement (lowering the mileage threshold from 100 to 75 miles), and expands cooperation with civilian healthcare systems.

Authorizes over $491 million to design and build new childcare centers, extends the Child Care in Your Home pilot, and starts a pilot to increase childcare assistance in high-cost areas.

Invests more than $206 million to build new schools for military children, protects DoD schools from sudden closure, expands Impact Aid (including an additional $20 million for schools serving children with severe disabilities), allows Guard and Reserve families to enroll in DoD schools when activated, and permits schools to limit or ban student cell phone use.

Strengthens the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) by allowing retiring servicemembers to immediately move into careers in the defense industrial base and medical professions, establishing a spouse-focused transition pilot, and improving metrics to ensure servicemembers get timely access to resources.

Enhances military recruiting by extending enlistment bonuses, requiring uniform medical accession standards, improving recruiter access to schools, expanding JROTC units, and authorizing bonuses for hard-to-fill JROTC instructor positions.

This appears to have happened in this case since Dr. McGraw was not suspended until this October.
After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report.
The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated.
Why did the Army fail to take disciplinary actions against Dr. McGraw until his October 2025 suspension?","WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and U.S. Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), Jill Tokuda (D-HI), Nanette Barragan (D-CA), Lori Trahan (D-MA), Veronica Escobar (D-TX), and Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) led 58 members of the Democratic Women’s Caucus, House Democrats, and Democratic Senators in a letter to the Department of Defense (DOD) Acting Inspector General demanding accountability for the Army’s failure to stop widespread sexual misconduct.

Recently, over 80 women joined a lawsuit alleging that Dr. Major Blaine McGraw made sexual advances, directed lewd comments towards them, and secretly recorded patients during exams while working at Ford Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center. This included at least 10 patients McGraw saw in Hawaii when he served as a resident at Tripler Army Medical Center from 2019-2023. Dr. McGraw was not suspended from his position until October 2025.

“No woman should feel unsafe receiving medical care, especially during sensitive and private health services. Yet, far too many survivors have come forward with their experiences of alleged exploitation and abuse by a doctor who reportedly violated not just the basic principles of medical care and human decency, but also the expected conduct of a U.S. Army officer and physician,” said Senator Hirono. “The Department of Defense and U.S. Army must take accountability for their failure to rapidly respond to servicemembers and patient complaints. While nothing can reverse the harm reported by patients, a comprehensive investigation into this alleged misconduct, resulting in stronger protections for patients, is necessary to ensure that no one experiences abuse by our military health system again.”

In their letter, the lawmakers expressed their outrage over Army leadership’s inaction despite numerous complaints from servicemembers and their families that Dr. McGraw had sexually exploited patients in his care for years. They also explained some of the unconscionable abuses women experienced, including details from the story of Jane Doe.

The lawmakers shared how the Army ignored Jane Doe’s attempts to report her abuse:

“After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report. Instead, she was told to ‘call or send an email.’ Jane Doe alleges she called the hospital seven different times but she was dismissed and hung up on each time. The purported lack of response and urgency to respond to these complaints would clearly violate reporting policy and the Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program protocols.”

They also expressed deep concern in their letter that this abuse is part of a recurring pattern of the Army failing to intervene in reports and cases of sexual misconduct:

“In the lawsuit, female servicemembers and patients noted that a recurring issue was the lack of adequate response from Army leadership. Reportedly, when victims and their loved ones tried to make complaints with Army leadership, they were ‘refused meetings at every level.’ If true, these women deserve better. The alleged dismissive response from the Army demonstrates an immense failure at every level to properly support survivors.”

The members and senators concluded the letter by demanding a full investigation from the DOD Inspector General, explanations on how complaints were handled, and stronger protections to ensure no patient faces this abuse again:

“The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated. That said, the separate concerns raised by survivors about members of the Army at many levels not timely acting on their complaints must be confronted immediately. Additionally, we request that DoD IG investigate to determine whether personnel within the Army properly followed procedures to timely report allegations of sexual misconduct to law enforcement and whether other SAPR procedures and existing protections were followed or not.”

Last week, Senator Hirono and the Hawaii Congressional delegation also sent a letter calling on the DOD to thoroughly investigate every complaint against McGraw and the Army’s own failures in allowing his alleged misconduct to persist.

In addition to Senator Hirono and Representatives Houlahan, Tokuda, Barragan, Trahan, Escobar, and Garcia, the letter was also signed by Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Representatives Joyce Beatty (D-OH), Julia Brownley (D-CA), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL), Andre Carson (D-IN), Judy Chu (D-CA), Maxine Dexter (D-OR), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Sarah Elfreth (D-MD), Lizzie Fletcher (D-TX), Valerie Foushee (D-NC), Lois Frankel (D-FL), Laura Friedman (D-CA), Robert Garcia (D-CA), Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ), Val Hoyle (D-OR), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL), Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Julie Johnson (D-TX), Timothy Kennedy (D-NY), Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM), Lucy McBath (D-GA), Sarah McBride (D-DE), Betty McCollum (D-MN), James McGovern (D-MA), LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Kelly Morrison (D-MN), Seth Moulton (D-MA), Eleanor Norton (D-DC), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Nellie Pou (D-NJ), Delia Ramirez (D-IL), Emily Randall (D-WA), Deborah Ross (D-NC), Andrea Salinas (D-OR), Janice Schakowsky (D-IL), Lateefah Simon (D-CA), Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Norma Torres (D-CA), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Nikema Williams (D-GA), and Frederica Wilson (D-FL).

The full text of the letter is available here and below.

Dear Mr. Stebbins:

We write to express our strong concerns about the Army’s purported failure to timely intervene in the alleged misconduct of Dr. Major Blaine McGraw at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center, allegations, which if true, would possibly constitute the largest sexual misconduct case in U.S. military history. According to reports, for years, Dr. McGraw allegedly sexually exploited women, including servicewomen and military wives, in his care. When these women attempted to report their concerns and experiences were purportedly repeatedly ignored and Dr. McGraw was kept on staff. The Army, like the other Services, has a history of failing to adequately address sexual misconduct in the ranks, which required Congress to step in and institute hundreds of reforms over the last fifteen years, culminating in the establishment of the Office of the Special Trial Counsel in the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). One of those issues involved military services being slow to intervene in cases at an early stage. This appears to have happened in this case since Dr. McGraw was not suspended until this October. This delayed response is unacceptable, and we need answers. Separate, and not to interfere with the ongoing Army criminal investigation into the alleged misconduct of Dr. McGraw, we request the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General review if appropriate Military Health System policies were followed, to include whether patient complaints were timely evaluated and considered, and provide recommendations to the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to prevent further instances like this from occurring in the future.

This month over 80 women joined a lawsuit together alleging that Dr. McGraw made lewd sexual advances and comments towards them, as well as secretly recorded patients during exams. One example of the women’s horrific experiences is captured through Jane Doe’s story. After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report. Instead, she was told to “call or send an email.” Jane Doe alleges she called the hospital seven different times but she was dismissed and hung up on each time. The purported lack of response and urgency to respond to these complaints would clearly violate reporting policy and the Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program protocols.

In the lawsuit, female servicemembers and patients noted that a recurring issue was the lack of adequate response from Army leadership. Reportedly, when victims and their loved ones tried to make complaints with Army leadership, they were “refused meetings at every level.” If true, these women deserve better. The alleged dismissive response from the Army demonstrates an immense failure at every level to properly support survivors.

The allegations against Dr. McGraw, and the Army’s purported failure to timely address survivor complaints, are not isolated. A separate investigation deemed Fort Hood as a notoriously “permissive environment” for sexual harassment and assault. The base has been plagued by this issue for years. For example, in 2020, Army Specialist Vanessa Guillén was murdered by a fellow soldier while stationed at Fort Hood. Throughout her time on base, Specialist Guillén was sexually harassed by a separate supervisor. Specialist Guillén’s tragic murder was the impetus for the aforementioned changes in the FY22 NDAA. However, even with these positive reforms, it is clear more needs to be done. The fact that this reported abuse occurred at the same base as Specialist Guillen’s murder is appalling. All women should be safe on a military base, and they surely should be able to safely seek treatment without fear of sexual assault or abuse.

The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated. That said, the separate concerns raised by survivors about members of the Army at many levels not timely acting on their complaints must be confronted immediately. Additionally, we request that DoD IG investigate to determine whether personnel within the Army properly followed procedures to timely report allegations of sexual misconduct to law enforcement and whether other SAPR procedures and existing protections were followed or not. We therefore request a response to the following questions from the Defense Health Agency and the Inspector General within 60 days of receipt:

Please provide the range of dates for the sexual harassment/assault complaints filed, including the number of complaints received at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center relating to Dr. McGraw.

What was the Military Treatment Facility management’s response to each complaint at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center?

How did the Military Treatment Facility management at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center follow appropriate policies to supervise staff, prevent patient harm, and address patient complaints?

What are the next steps the Military Treatment Facility management at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center will take to further protect patients from sexual assault?

How will the Defense Health Agency ensure that no Military Treatment Facility will ignore sexual abuse allegations again?

How will the Defense Health Agency prevent future concealment and employment of sexual abusers on their staff across Military Treatment Facilities?

Was a quality assurance investigation initiated? If so, please share the status with the House Armed Services Committee.

Why did the Army fail to take disciplinary actions against Dr. McGraw until his October 2025 suspension?

We are committed to demanding justice for victims of sexual assault and harassment, and we will not stay silent while the safety of women is at risk. Again, we request prompt and thorough answers to these questions to prevent further harm and hold those responsible for this accountable.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Sincerely,

However, whether the universal access has translated into improved patient outcome is unknown. This study compared survival of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the MHS with that in the U.S. general population.

Methods: The MHS data were obtained from The Department of Defense's (DoD) Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR), and the U.S. population data were drawn from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The study subjects were NSCLC patients diagnosed between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 2012, in ACTUR and a sample of SEER patients who were matched to the ACTUR patients on age group, sex, race, and year of diagnosis group with a matching ratio of 1:4.

This research addresses a critical gap in understanding treatment pathways for musculoskeletal shoulder conditions—one of the most frequent causes of pain and disability among active-duty service members and veterans. By analyzing longitudinal data from the Military Health System, the team identified patterns in healthcare utilization, including diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, surgical interventions, and medication use.

""Our findings provide a clearer picture of how care is delivered for shoulder disorders in a large, integrated health system. This knowledge is essential for identifying opportunities to improve efficiency and ensure patients receive the right care at the right time,"" said Steven Z. George, PT, PhD, professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

Key Findings:

Shoulder disorders represent a significant burden in military populations, often requiring multi-modal care.

Utilization patterns varied based on diagnosis type, patient demographics, and care setting.

The study highlights opportunities to optimize care delivery, reduce unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes.

Why It Matters:

Musculoskeletal injuries are among the leading causes of limited duty and medical discharge in the military. Understanding how patients navigate care systems can inform evidence-based guidelines, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient-centered care for both military and civilian populations.

""By examining real-world data from the Military Health System, we can better understand treatment patterns and identify gaps in care. These insights are critical for developing strategies that improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs,"" said Maggie E.

The House passed a defense authorization bill Dec. 10 without a provision to allow health care coverage of in vitro fertilization for active-duty military.

Pro-life groups cheered the provision’s removal from the bill. The original bill would have required Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “ensure that fertility-related care for a member of the uniformed services on active duty (or a dependent of such a member) shall be covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.” Tricare does not cover IVF.

The House passed the bill (S. 1071) by a vote of 312-112, and Senate consideration is next.

Like last year, the IVF provision was eliminated from the defense authorization bill shortly before its consideration. President Donald Trump had made a campaign promise to make IVF free.

A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNA in a statement that “President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF.”

“The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” the spokesperson said.

Live Action President Lila Rose praised Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

“Students for Life has opposed IVF as practiced, as it's a business model that by design, destroys far more lives than are allowed to live and thrive,” Students for Life Vice President Kristy Hamrick told CNA in a statement responding to Speaker Mike Johnson’s move to strip the bill of IVF provisions. “The move to pull the funding for IVF will free up resources to seek better answers,” she said.

“Unquestioning financial support props up an industry known to prey on people's hopes for a child while ending many lives. We need to seek better answers for the question of how to help people have families than to assume that IVF is the solution,” she said. “We can do better.”

The Advancing American Freedom Foundation, which is led by former Vice President Mike Pence, posted a memo on X stating “many pro-life Americans are opposed to IVF because the standard process destroys human embryos.”

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council reacted to news that IVF would be cut from the bill by praising Johnson, and said in a post on X: “The Speaker is right to put the pause on IVF funding in the Defense spending bill.”

“The IVF industry operates with little, if any, oversight, which has led to the creation and destruction of tens of thousands of so-called ‘excess’ embryos,” he said. “There are other pro-life options. Taxpayers' dollars should fund fertility methods that respect human dignity, treat the underlying causes of infertility, AND are successful—like Restorative Reproductive Medicine.”",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/invitrofertilization022025.jpg?jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 07:57:07.149522

Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm – an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance.
So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits.
Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm - an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance.
So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits.","[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – At a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing today, Ranking Member Richard Blumenthal emphasized the harmful impact failing to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits will have on veterans and their families. Recent analysis found 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will no longer be able to afford ACA marketplace coverage if these credits are not extended.

Blumenthal pressed the urgency of addressing this issue ahead of a vote tomorrow on a Democratic proposal to extend ACA enhanced premium tax credits for three years before they expire at the end of the year: “…[W]e have to recognize the importance of votes that we will take tomorrow, one of them to extend the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that will affect literally 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits to afford health insurance. And whether you support the ACA, whether you have other views on what might be a perfect system in the long run if we had tons of time, the simple fact is we face a deadline at the end of the year when these tax credits will expire and 267,000 veterans will no longer be able to afford ACA coverage if these credits are not extended.”

The Senator continued, “These are primarily veterans not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, and often not eligible to get care through VA – leaving them with ACA marketplace plans as their only option for health care coverage. The ACA isn’t perfect… but the fact of the matter is the consequences of failing to extend these tax credits will be devastating for veterans and their families. Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm – an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance. They deserve better. So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits. I hope that we approve them to the benefit of those veterans and countless other Americans affected.”

Veterans who benefit from ACA tax credits are primarily those not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, or who are not eligible to get some or all of their health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In addition, 1.6 million veterans and four million family members of veterans utilize Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage because of the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One in ten veterans under the age of 65 rely on Medicaid, and forty percent of these veterans rely on Medicaid as their sole coverage.

Republicans have thus far refused to work with Democrats to extend the enhanced premium tax credits that have helped millions of Americans afford health insurance. Now, tens of millions of Americans across the country are staring down increased health insurance rates that are set to double and even triple their monthly premiums. Coupled with Republicans’ Medicare and Medicaid cuts that go into effect next year, Americans, including millions of veterans, are bracing for higher costs and a looming health care crisis.

Video of Blumenthal’s opening statement is available here and the full text is copied below.

Senator Blumenthal: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to hear testimony on some very important bipartisan legislation today. But, before we begin, I think we have to recognize the importance of votes that we will take tomorrow, one of them to extend the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that will affect literally 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits to afford health insurance. And whether you support the ACA, whether you have other views on what might be a perfect system in the long run if we had tons of time, the simple fact is we face a deadline at the end of the year when these tax credits will expire and 267,000 veterans will no longer be able to afford ACA coverage if these credits are not extended.

These are primarily veterans not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, and often not eligible to get care through VA – leaving them with ACA marketplace plans as their only option for health care coverage. The ACA isn’t perfect. We need to lower the costs of health care generally. We need to work on reforms, and we need to eliminate any fraud that exists in these programs, but the fact of the matter is the consequences of failing to extend these tax credits will be devastating for veterans and their families. Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm - an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance. They deserve better. So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits. I hope that we approve them to the benefit of those veterans and countless other Americans affected.

On the legislation today, I particularly want to thank Mr. Stichman for his work, alongside the Yale Veterans Legal Services Clinic, to improve how federal appellate courts process VA appeals.

I’ve worked with the Yale Veterans Legal Services Clinic over the years, and I know how important their work is generally. The Veterans Appeals Efficiency Act, which I co-lead with Senator Banks, is one of many bills that we’re here to discuss. And I will be supporting many, if not all of them. For example, the Molly Loomis Act which would build on the promise of the PACT Act by exploring health conditions prevalent among descendants of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during their service. And we have to confront, as well, the painful legacy of discrimination. The Commission on Equity and Reconciliation in the Uniformed Services Act would investigate the harm done to LGBTQ+ servicemembers and veterans, many of whom received punitive discharges, and were forced to hide their identities and ultimately denied benefits.

These measures are not partisan. This Committee generally is not partisan.

Mental health professionals are not immune to the pressures associated with deployments or their care of service members and their families. Many specialists put their own advice into practice, seeking support when faced with mental health challenges.

One of the most important first steps they can take is finding someone to help ease the load. That’s the advice of Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist who is the director for psychological health for the U.S. Navy.

Long said she found it challenging to reconnect with her family after a deployment to Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. She and her spouse discovered couples’ counseling through their local Fleet and Family Service Center that combined with resources for their toddler.

The couples’ counseling “made such a difference, because I knew what I wanted, and I knew that it was important for me to reconnect. I just didn't know exactly how to do that,” Long said. “Just a little bit ironic, given what I do, but we all need help sometimes.”

Therapy helps resolve bad experiences

Long praised her experience seeking support. “Therapy can be so helpful for folks, whether they're struggling with relationships, anxiety, depression, or trauma-related symptoms. In some ways, it forces us to confront our problems.”

“Most of us want to compartmentalize our issues. We don't want to think about our negative past experiences and problems. We want to distract ourselves or focus on career or something else,” Long said. “Therapy gives us that dedicated time and space to talk through something, to gain that awareness, that insight.”

Therapy can identify what is contributing to a mental health challenge. “Having someone guide that process helps,” said Long. “We do it together because it's not easy to figure it out on our own.”

“I think focusing efforts on strengthening true connections, and having service members supporting others can go a long way,” she said.

“I’ve seen mental health (counselors) … it’s not a secret and I’m wildly open about it,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., noting that he sought care through military family life counselors and Military OneSource.

Mental health professionals are “not perfect. We all feel overwhelmed?” Cote said. “Seeking these resources has been beneficial in that I can treat my patients better now.”

Long said her own success with counseling could parallel with anyone who needs support — wherever they are in their mental health journey.

“Connection with others — true, deep, meaningful connection with others — that’s one of the things that can draw people to the service,” she said.

Long said fears of losing security clearances, not promoting, or separation from the military may hinder a service member from seeking help. However, a study from 2021 to 2023 by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency found barely 1/100th of 1% of cases resulted in security denials or revocations were due to psychological health and additional conditions.

In fact, DCSA said seeking support leads to recovery and is more likely to enhance a military career than harm it, because of the openness demonstrated by the applicant in the process.

Get help early to boost recovery

Unfortunately, some people don't seek help until they're in crisis mode, which can make recovery harder. “Not impossible,” Long said. “But it requires so much more work to intervene later versus earlier.”

“Getting help early is critical and connecting with someone is such an important protective factor against suicide,” Long said. “There's so much more opportunity to get to work on something, to improve before it becomes a crisis.”

Available Military Health System mental health resources

The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a comprehensive listing of mental health services available throughout the MHS. This includes options to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on a variety of resources. You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click.

Targeted Care. This new process connects you to the specific type of care you need after an initial evaluation — and can be an individual appointment, in-person group therapy or virtual group therapy. Targeted care is now available at many military mental health clinics.

TRICARE covered mental health services are available through its worldwide network of civilian providers. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit the mental health doctors and appointments page.

Virtual care: The Defense Health Agency continues to expand mental health services available to service members at remote installations. One example is BRAVE, the DHA’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, provides tele-mental health services at 84 locations around the world by connecting service members with counselors through virtual sessions.

inTransition is a confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and retirees, who are receiving mental health or traumatic brain injury care and experiencing disruption in their lives, like a PCS (permanent change of station) move, separation, or retirement.

The Real Warriors Campaign, a Department of War public health initiative, strives to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and encourage early mental health help-seeking behaviors in the military community.

The Warrior Care Recovery Coordination Program, executed by the three branches of service, provides holistic care to wounded, ill, or injured service members and their families and caregivers. Recovery Care Coordinators serve as a guide through recovery, rehabilitation, and transition or reintegration by facilitating a comprehensive recovery plan. This plan covers needs associated with daily living, career, family, finances, health, legal, military issues, and spirituality.

The Brandon Act is a law that empowers service members to receive the help they need by seeking a referral for a mental health evaluation through their commander or supervisor. This guidance helps with the process. The purpose of the Brandon Act is to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.

Military OneSource. Service members and their families can also receive referrals to nonmedical support such as a chaplain, financial advisor, or a military family life counselor through Military OneSource, a one-stop 24/7 gateway to trusted resources, information, and confidential help. Call 800-342-9647. Military OneSource can also help with referrals such as the impact of a parent on deployment to a child’s health and happiness, or a substance abuse issue.

The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

The new program will help eligible Michigan National Guard members pay for child care costs during weekend drills or annual training.
“National Guard members have the same day-to-day responsibilities and costs anyone else does, including child care,” said state Senator Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores).
“Our National Guard members put their lives on hold to serve and protect our state,” said state Senator Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe).","LANSING, Mich. — Today, Governor Whitmer signed Senate Bills 370, 540, and 542. These bills will lower the cost of health care and child care for members of the Michigan National Guard and their families. These bipartisan bills will strengthen the support systems service members rely on and ensure they can focus on their missions knowing that their families are safe and cared for. Including today’s legislation, Governor Whitmer has signed a record 1,539 bipartisan bills into law since taking office.

“These bills reaffirm our commitment to fight for those who fight for us,” said Governor Whitmer. “We are lowering the cost of health care and child care for members of the Michigan National Guard, ensuring they can carry out their missions to keep us all safe and provide for their families too. I’m proud that legislators worked across the aisle to pass these commonsense bills, building on years of bipartisan progress we have made to help our National Guard balance their service and their daily lives. Let’s keep working together to make health care and child care more affordable for everyone and stay focused on getting things done that make a real difference in people’s lives.”

Evidence-based medical standards help ensure that service members can perform their duties effectively and safely — directly contributing to mission success.","2025 marks the 30th anniversary of the Medical Standards Analytics and Research program, the Department of War's premier analytical capability, providing policymakers with actionable data to shape evidence-based medical standards and support military health and performance.

In 1995, the U.S. Army Surgeon General established the Accession Medical Standards Analysis and Research Activity to improve the health, readiness, and resilience of service members by transforming complex data into actionable insights to guide policy. With its mission expanded, it is now known as the Medical Standards Analytics and Research program, or MSAR, and is housed in the Statistics and Epidemiology branch at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The program continues to deliver science-based recommendations to optimize recruitment and retention and enhance warfighter readiness.

“The standards for accession into the U.S. military are high, uncompromising, and clear,” wrote Secretary of War Pete Hegseth in an April 2025 memo emphasizing that “Young Americans seeking to serve in the greatest fighting force in history must be physically and mentally capable of performing their duties in the harshest conditions.”

Data-driven support for these rigorous standards makes MSAR’s key capabilities even more imperative, as MSAR generates knowledge products tracking that service members are physically and medically fit to meet the demands of military service.

With physicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and data analysts at the helm, MSAR oversees large-scale epidemiological analyses, predictive modeling, and biostatistical assessments to evaluate medical standards by examining the impact of medical conditions, occupational exposures, diseases, and injuries on military service.

""MSAR's core mission is to validate, standardize, analyze, and transform complex data into actionable insights,” said Dr. Natalya Weber, director of the WRAIR’s Statistics and Epidemiology branch and chief of MSAR. “Our work empowers leaders to make informed decisions regarding medical standards, recruitment, and warfighter health and readiness.”

Over the last 30 years, the team has generated dozens of reports, above 60 peer-reviewed journal publications, and countless other products to provide valuable insights into medical readiness, adverse attrition, and disability evaluations.

Guided by the Offices of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Affairs, Health Services Policy and Oversight, and Under Secretary of War for Personnel and Readiness Military Personnel Policy, MSAR provides continuous data-driven assessments, evaluating the rigorousness of medical standards and service-specific waiver decisions. The offices oversee data provision to MSAR and direct the depth and breadth of its programmatic tasking. This is just one example of leadership’s dedicated efforts to foster a data-driven culture across the department, which helps inform decisions at all levels.

“The MSAR focus is on ensuring that we fulfill our mission with precision and uphold the highest standards of data integrity,” said Caitlin Rushin, deputy chief of MSAR. “We ensure that our analytic datasets are accurate, actionable, and expertly analyzed to provide the insights necessary for informed decision-making.”

Evidence-based medical standards make sure service members can perform their duties effectively and safely — directly contributing to mission success. By proactively enforcing clear medical standards, the DOW reduces long-term health care costs, optimizes personnel availability, and supports veteran care.

For 30 years, MSAR has provided critical epidemiologic and analytic support to the Accession and Retention Medical Standards Working Group, providing numerous analyses detailing accession, waiver, disqualification, retention, and disability evaluation trends. The team’s systematic generation of critical data metrics and comparative analyses has allowed the working group to address medical readiness more efficiently and adjust when needed. This approach maximizes cost benefits, workload, and time, all while advancing readiness.

“MSAR’s value isn’t just in describing medical trends, but in predicting potential challenges to warfighter readiness,” said Army Maj. Jared Egbert, the associate director of WRAIR’s Statistics and Epidemiology branch and associate chief of MSAR. “Ultimately, our work ensures policy isn't reactive, but anticipatory, safeguarding our nation’s fighting strength.”

Notably, MSAR follows service members who enter service with medical waivers to examine their attrition, deployability, and health care utilization in comparison with those fully medically qualified. MSAR also identifies medical conditions that are most often waived, rarely approved, or frequently associated with high attrition and cost. These important indicators keep senior leaders informed regarding where policies might need to change and estimate impact of the changes.

The data collected directly informs the DOW’s medical standards policies, particularly DoDI 6130.03 Volumes 1 and 2 which are instrumental for maintaining a strong and lethal military. By identifying these trends, the MSAR team improves efficiency and saves time, money, and effort in the recruitment and medical screening process.

Accession and retention medical standards ensure service members can perform their duties without posing undue risk to themselves or others. These standards provide clear guidance for military health care providers, line officers, and other officials to determine whether a service member can continue service.

Without standards, the consequences could be dire.

“Without solid accession and retention medical standards, we would have a military that is likely not medically ready to perform routine service duties and support our nation in the event of a conflict,” said Tim Powers, MSAR’s senior statistician.

With a focus on readiness, MSAR continuously reevaluates standards and concludes that Service Medical Waiver Review Authorities strike an appropriate balance between managing adverse attrition and meeting the unique needs of each service. MSAR findings validate the effectiveness of its data-driven approach, confirming that medical standards are upheld to align with dynamic operational requirements and applied within the established evidence-based framework.

Darnall Army Medical Center on Tuesday, the same day military prosecutors preferred four charges and 61 specifications against Maj. Blaine McGraw, an OBGYN assigned to the hospital who is now in custody.

Under Secretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre toured the facility to review Defense Health Agency policies, patient safety practices and overall care standards. Rear Adm. Matthew Case, acting deputy director of DHA, also joined the visit. Darnall operates under the DHA network, which oversees military medical facilities worldwide.

Obadal emphasized that maintaining patient trust and safety remains the Army’s highest priority, particularly in light of the allegations against McGraw.

“Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,” Obadal said. “I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety.”

Izaguirre said the Army is closely examining how medical training, standards and oversight are carried out across facilities.

“We are looking closely at how training is conducted, how standards are enforced and how leaders ensure that policies are being followed,” she said. “Based on this review, we will work with the DHA to implement any necessary recommendations quickly and transparently to maintain faith with soldiers and families.”

Those steps will align with an Army-directed Inspector General review focused on medical treatment policies and practices.

McGraw faces allegations involving more than 100 individuals across multiple states for secretly recording patients during their exams. The claims involve patients from Fort Hood, Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

""These reports are deeply concerning and indescribably horrific. I and my staff are in contact with the Army and monitoring their investigation. I'm committed to ensuring a full accounting of the facts and that justice is served,” said Senator Ted Cruz in a statement.

McGraw is being held at the Bell County Jail as an inmate of the U.S. Army.

The removal of the IVF provision in the 2026 NDAA is a tactical defeat, but the war is not over.","For military families, the promise of comprehensive reproductive healthcare has long felt like a mirage, always visible on the horizon but forever dissolving as you approach. For the past year, beneficiaries have been led to believe that relief is finally inbound. The Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act included bipartisan language that would have required Tricare to cover In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) for all active-duty service members, finally modernizing a benefit stuck in the Cold War era for decades.

But as the final conference report dropped on Dec. 9, 2025, that provision was nowhere to be found.

It was not lost to a clerical error or a budget oversight, either. It was stripped by House leadership behind closed doors, reportedly due to ideological disputes regarding the status of embryos created during the IVF process. The result is that while members of Congress and federal civil servants enjoy comprehensive fertility coverage, the troops who deploy to defend them do not.

For the average military family, the 2026 landscape is now a little bleaker, leaving them to navigate a broken system with nothing but their own bank accounts and perhaps a few tactical workarounds.

The Financial Scunion

To understand the frustration rippling through the spouse networks, one must look at the math. Excluding this provision not only hurts morale; it also erodes savings accounts. Tricare currently covers only the diagnostic portion of infertility, the labs and exams that identify the problem, but pays zero dollars for the actual treatment unless the service member has a “serious or severe” illness or injury directly caused by their service.

For everyone else, the cost is draining. The average price of one single IVF cycle in the civilian world now runs between $15,000 and $30,000 after factoring in items like medications and genetic testing. Let’s put that into perspective: an E-5 with six years of service takes home a base pay of about $3,800 a month. That means their first attempt to start a family costs almost 75 percent of a sergeant’s annual base pay before taxes.

The Department of Defense is basically asking families to pay a “retention tax” to have children, forcing them to choose between staying in uniform or separating to work for a company like Starbucks, Amazon, or the federal civil service that offers the benefits the military refuses to fund.

The Loophole: MTFs and the “Discount”

If the Pentagon will not pay the bill, families must find a way to hack the system. The most viable workaround is the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) “cost-recovery” program. While Tricare will not cover a civilian clinic, roughly seven military hospitals across the globe offer IVF, in which the professional fees, including the doctors’ and surgery costs, are covered. The patient is responsible only for the contracted laboratory fees and medications, which typically run between $5,000 and $8,000 per cycle, rather than the civilian average of $25,000.

However, accessing these hubs is a logistical nightmare, akin to changing a hot machine-gun barrel with your bare hands. Patients must be stationed near one or get command approval to travel out of pocket.

With 2026 around the corner, the open and operational hubs include Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, which serves as the East Coast flagship, with costs around $6,383 plus medications. Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio serves the central region but operates on a batched cycle system with a waitlist that can stretch up to a year. Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii and Naval Medical Center San Diego handle the Pacific demand, though travel costs often wash out the savings for those not locally stationed.

A critical warning for families in the Pacific Northwest: Madigan Army Medical Center is currently closed to new IVF referrals until at least March 2026 due to severe provider shortages. Relying on outdated referral lists for Madigan will result in dead ends and lost time.

The “Civilian Spouse” Maneuver

Perhaps the most overlooked strategy involves leveraging state law against the federal policy. While Tricare is a federal program exempt from state insurance mandates, civilian employers are not always afforded the same exemption. If a non-active duty spouse secures employment with a company based in a “mandate state“, such as New York, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, or Colorado, that employer’s “fully insured” health plan is legally required to cover IVF.

Of course, families should verify with human resources whether a plan is “fully insured” or “self-insured,” since “self-insured” is regulated by federal ERISA laws and often exempt from state mandates.

Pharmaceutical Hacks and Grants

For those forced into the civilian sector, the medication bill alone can rival the cost of a car. Some pharmaceutical companies do offer discount programs that can create a financial tourniquet in dire times. Compassionate Corps provides free fertility medication to eligible veterans with service-connected injuries who lack insurance coverage. For active-duty personnel, ReUnite Assist offers an automatic 25 percent discount on specific medications such as Follistim and Ganirelix, with deeper discounts available based on financial need.

The non-profit sector has also stepped into the breach. The Bob Woodruff Foundation’s VIVA program offers grants of up to $5,000 per cycle for veterans, often covering costs that the VA rejects, such as donor gametes or surrogacy. Baby Quest and the Cade Foundation also provide substantial grants ranging from $2,000 to $16,000 open to active-duty families.

The removal of the IVF provision in the 2026 NDAA is a tactical defeat, but the war is not over. Advocacy groups like the Military Officers Association of America and RESOLVE are already pivoting their strategy for the FY2027 cycle. The argument is shifting from a plea for social benefits to a hard-nosed assessment of readiness. With the military facing historic recruiting challenges, the data suggests it simply cannot afford to bleed mid-career talent because it refuses to support the families it claims to cherish.

Until the policy changes, families must utilize every loophole, apply for every grant, and document every dollar spent. The receipts of 2026 will likely be the ammunition needed to win the fight in 2027. As always, we must do what we do best: adapt and overcome.

When to use civilian dental care Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs.
• Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.
You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook.
• The TRICARE Dental Program offers coverage to family members of ADSMs and National Guard or Reserve members not on active orders and family members.","Maintaining dental health is a critical part of overall force readiness. Are you on active duty but live far away from your nearest military dental clinic? Or do you need dental care that your military dental clinic can’t provide?

You should know that TRICARE offers the Active Duty Dental Program. This program allows active duty service members to get care through civilian providers under certain circumstances. The ADDP helps catch problems early and prevents them from becoming more serious.

“Knowing when to see a civilian dentist can save time and prevent complications,” said Douglas Elsesser, dental program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “ADDP guides you to the right dental care without unnecessary delays. It helps make sure you get the care that you need, when you need it.”

Who can get care through the ADDP The ADDP is available to all ADSMs. It also covers National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days. Some members in early activation, the Transitional Assistance Management Program, or in line of duty status also qualify.

How you get care depends on where you’re stationed and if you’re remotely located. • CONUS: o You’re remotely located if you live and work more than 50 miles away from a military dental clinic. o Not remote? You can see a civilian dentist through the ADDP with a referral from your military dental clinic. • OCONUS: You must be enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas.

When to use civilian dental care Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs. However, they can’t always provide every type of treatment. Also, not every service member is stationed close to one. In those cases, the ADDP lets you see a civilian dentist at no cost, as long as you follow the ADDP rules.

You may be eligible to see a civilian dentist through ADDP in two situations: • Remote locations: You’re assigned to a duty station more than 50 miles from a military dental clinic. • Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.

Getting an Appointment Control Number Before scheduling with a civilian dentist, you’ll need an Appointment Control Number.

An ACN allows TRICARE to pay for your civilian dental visit under the ADDP. You must have one before getting care outside a military dental clinic. • If you already have an authorization or referral: Your authorization letter will list your ACN. You can find this letter in your ADDP My Account. • If you don’t have an authorization or referral: You may still be able to request your own ACN for routine dental care. The needed care must meet these criteria: o It’s a covered benefit. o It costs less than $750 per procedure or appointment. o It totals no more than $1,500 in a 12-month period. o It’s scheduled with a network dentist (CONUS).

Do you need specialty care? Or do your costs exceed these limits? You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook. You can find more details on ACNs and other program rules in the handbook.

How to request an ACN: • Submit an ACN Request Form online (fastest option, CONUS only). • Call the ADDP contractor, United Concordia, at 866-984-2337 (CONUS) or 844-653-4058 (OCONUS).

How to make an appointment with a civilian dentist: Once you have an ACN, here’s what to do:

If you’re in a CONUS location: • You can schedule an appointment with a network dentist. United Concordia can help you. Do you have a referral? Your military dental clinic can also schedule your appointment.

If you’re in an OCONUS location: • Call United Concordia for help finding a TRICARE OCONUS Preferred Dentist. A TOPD will: o File claims for you o Submit pre-authorizations before you get costly or complex treatment

New tool for military dental care: findDHA If you aren’t using the ADDP for civilian care, you’ll go to a military dental clinic. The Defense Health Agency recently launched findDHA, an interactive mapping tool. This tool can help you find the closest military dental clinic for routine care.

ADDP vs. other TRICARE dental programs Are you a family member, retiree, or service member who isn’t on active duty? You won’t get care through the ADDP. You can buy dental coverage through a different program. • The TRICARE Dental Program offers coverage to family members of ADSMs and National Guard or Reserve members not on active orders and family members. • The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program offers coverage to retired service members and their family members.

By covering care at military dental clinics with support from civilian dentists in the ADDP, TRICARE helps you maintain dental readiness wherever you serve.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9430964/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-10 12:57:03.756553

The three pieces of legislation, Senate Bills 370, 540 and 542, follow House Bill 4962, which establishes a Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund to help servicemembers afford childcare, health care and tuition. House Bill 4962 did not take effect immediately as the tie-barred legislation was not passed until earlier this month.

Now, that Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund can be drawn upon thanks to the recent legislation passing.

“These bills reaffirm our commitment to fight for those who fight for us,” said Gov. Whitmer. “We are lowering the cost of health care and child care for members of the Michigan National Guard, ensuring they can carry out their missions to keep us all safe and provide for their families too. I’m proud that legislators worked across the aisle to pass these commonsense bills, building on years of bipartisan progress we have made to help our National Guard balance their service and their daily lives. Let’s keep working together to make health care and child care more affordable for everyone and stay focused on getting things done that make a real difference in people’s lives.""

Senate Bill 370, which establishes the Tricare Premium Reimbursement Program Act, will reimburse eligible members of the Michigan National Guard for the costs of Tricare health and dental insurance premiums.

According to the legislation's language, eligibility for the reimbursements is defined as: ""a member of the Michigan National Guard who is eligible for coverage under the Tricare reserve select program or the Tricare dental program and meets any other eligibility criteria established by the department.""

Senate Bill 370 was passed nearly unanimously in both chambers and takes effect immediately. Only Rep. Steve Cara (R-Three Rivers) voted against the bill.

Senate Bill 540 establishes the Michigan National Guard Child Care Assistance Program, which would provide a stipend for childcare to eligible members of the Michigan National Guard.

The bill defines eligible members of the Michigan National Guard as:

The member is in active service

The member is not absent without leave (AWOL) or under charges described in the Michigan Code of Military Justice

Any other criteria determined by the adjutant general consistent with Michigan National Guard recruiting and retention requirements

The stipend is only given to applicants if both the following apply:

There is enough money in the Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund proposed by House Bill 4962 to cover the amount of assistance applied for

Either of the following:

The applicant is a single parent

The applicant’s spouse is also an eligible member

Child care assistance through the stipend can only be provided for up to 12 hours a day for weekend drills and annual training, and up to a maximum of 39 days a year.

Senate Bill 540 passed with strong bipartisan support in both chambers and goes into effect immediately.

Senate Bill 542 amends the Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Act to move its remaining unencumbered balance from the Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Fund to the Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund proposed by House Bill 4962.

The tuition assistance program will eligible members of the Michigan National Guard to pay for education that would culminate in:

A vocational or technical training

A certificate

The individual’s first associate degree

The individual’s first bachelor’s degree

The individual’s first master’s degree

Senate Bill 542 passed with strong bipartisan support in both chambers and goes into effect immediately.

Following this expansion, all disease funds offered by PAN are now available for those enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare.
“We are proud to expand insurance eligibility for these 46 disease funds, ensuring even more people can receive help affording their out-of-pocket healthcare costs,” said Kevin L. Hagan, PAN Foundation President and CEO.

Previously, these funds were only available to those enrolled in Medicare, including Medicare Advantage plans. Following this expansion, all disease funds offered by PAN are now available for those enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare.

This insurance eligibility expansion comes at a time when many, particularly Medicaid enrollees, are bracing for higher out-of-pocket costs, and helps to increase access to care for tens of millions of Americans who rely on these programs.

“We are proud to expand insurance eligibility for these 46 disease funds, ensuring even more people can receive help affording their out-of-pocket healthcare costs,” said Kevin L. Hagan, PAN Foundation President and CEO. “Regardless of where they live, their income, or the insurance coverage they have, everyone deserves access to the treatment they need. By expanding insurance eligibility for these disease funds, we are a step closer to our vision of a future where equitable, accessible healthcare is a reality for all.”

The expanded insurance eligibility applies to 45 financial assistance programs to help qualified patients afford their medication copay expenses, and one program dedicated to helping patients afford their health insurance premiums.

PAN disease funds with expanded insurance eligibility include:

Eligibility requirements

Specific eligibility requirements vary by disease fund. But, in general, for these funds patients must:

Be receiving treatment for the disease

Have Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE insurance that covers the qualifying medication or product

Take a medication or product listed on PAN’s comprehensive list of covered medications for the given fund

Have a household income that meets the specified requirements of the fund

Reside and receive treatment in the United States or U.S. territories (U.S. citizenship is not a requirement)

How to apply

If a disease fund is open and you meet the eligibility criteria, you can apply online through the PAN portal or by phone. We encourage you to apply online through the PAN portal, but if you prefer to apply by phone, call us at 1-866-316-7263 Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET.

Healthcare professionals can apply online through the PAN portal or by phone on behalf of their patients.

If a disease fund is closed, you can sign up to join the wait list. When the fund receives more funding, PAN will open the fund to the wait list to apply for financial assistance. Learn more about PAN’s disease fund wait lists.
