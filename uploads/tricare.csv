(HNFS), a government contractor that provides TRICARE healthcare management services to active duty military members and their families. HNFS as well as its parent corporation Centene agreed to pay just over $11 million to resolve alleged false claims submitted to the U.S. Department of Defense.

While American values dictate that we thank service members for their role in protecting our freedoms, this government contractor instead chose to submit false claims in order to keep up their deal with the Department of Defense. Ultimately, it was taxpayers who footed the bill for fraud and false claims with government contractors. Taxpayers should never pay for shoddy services, especially not when it comes to healthcare and protecting personal and sensitive data relating to military members and their families.

The Allegations Against Health Net Federal Services, LLC and Centene Corporation

According to the DOJ, parent corporation Centene and its subsidiary Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) failed to meet these minimum cybersecurity protocols between the period of 2015 and 2018 while providing data management services to the U.S. Department of Defense through its administration of TRICARE. HNFS may have exposed U.S. service members’ personal and health data, as well as that of their families, due to failing to scan for known vulnerabilities and patching known security flaws. The networks and systems maintained by HNFS during this three year period were reported by third party security auditors as well as the company’s own internal audit department for being inadequate in terms of:

Asset management

Access controls

Flawed configuration settings

Weak firewalls or lack of firewalls in use

End-of-life hardware and software in place

Lack of patch management

Vulnerability scanning

Shoddy password policies

HFNS not only allegedly failed to install updates from vendors that would have countered known threats; they also allegedly falsely certified compliance with annual reports to DHA in order to keep their government contract with TRICARE. In order to resolve these allegations, the company Centene Corporation, which acquired all shares of HFNS as well as its liabilities, has agreed to pay $11,253,400. The matter was resolved in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California, as well as with assistance from the DoD Office of Inspector General, the DCIS, Cyber Field Office Western Region, the Inspector General’s Office of Audits, Cyberspace Operations Directorate, and the DoD’s Defense Contract Management Agency, Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center.

What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a federal health insurance program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense and its contracts. TRICARE provides healthcare coverage to qualifying members of the U.S. military and their families, including:

Active duty service members and their families

National Guard and Reserve members and families

Medal of Honor recipients and their families

Survivors

Children

Former spouses

TRICARE is similar to Medicare in that it is a primary health insurance provider funded by taxpayer dollars and administered by a federal agency. While Medicare covers older Americans ages 65 and up, TRICARE provides medical, dental, and pharmacy coverage for U.S. military members, veterans, and family members. Because of this, TRICARE also maintains personal and sensitive data for military members, including some confidential location information for active duty personnel. Like all health data, TRICARE records include HIPAA-protected information and other confidential information, which can be exposed to data breaches by criminal hackers and contractors who do not take their cybersecurity obligations seriously. TRICARE breaches are especially troubling because they can lead to the unlawful dissemination of protected information that compromises individual health privacy and potentially national security.

Federal Healthcare Programs Are Vulnerable to Cybersecurity Breaches

Acting U.S. Attorney Michele Beckwith for the Eastern District of California spoke about the HNFS settlement, saying “Safeguarding sensitive government information, particularly when it relates to the health and well-being of millions of service members and their families, is of paramount importance. When HNFS failed to uphold its cybersecurity obligations, it didn’t just breach its contract with the government, it breached its duty to the people who sacrifice so much in defense of our nation.”

Both healthcare and defense spending for government contracts are two of the most at-risk areas for fraud, waste, and abuse. Taxpayers lose billions of dollars every year to government contractors and healthcare organizations that take advantage of federal healthcare programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, with an estimated 10% of program expenses at risk. Meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office reports that the U.S. Department of Defense is particularly vulnerable to false or fraudulent claims involving overbilling, billing for work never performed or services not rendered to beneficiaries, fraudulent bid submissions, non-competitive bids, the provisions of substandard parts or services, and the failure to disclose data breaches and other cybersecurity risks.

How Whistleblowers Can Protect Americans Through the False Claims Act

Under the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative, private companies that contract with the federal government are obligated to uphold certain minimum cybersecurity standards. When they fail to do so, or falsely certify compliance with cybersecurity requirements, they can be held accountable under the False Claims Act for treble damages and penalties to the federal government. Through a qui tam lawsuit, whistleblowers who report on these kinds of violations can also receive a percentage of the government’s total recovery. These percentages can range from 10% to 30% of the final settlement. The False Claims Act imposes treble damages upon violators, as well as individual penalties for each false claims of up to $13,946 to $27,894 per violation. The law also allows whistleblowers (known as relators) who meet certain eligibility requirements and are the first to report cybersecurity fraud, government contractor fraud including DOD fraud, or healthcare fraud a reward for their inside information.

Whistleblowers can come from all walks of life and may include current or former employees of any potential defendant such as employees of government contractors, health care entities, or any regulated company, non-employees (examiners, competitors, clients, customers, auditors, reviewers, consultants, industry experts), anyone with evidence and knowledge of fraud involving government money. As long as you come forward willingly and in a timely manner you may be able to bring a qui tam case with the help of a qui tam lawyer and recover a reward. There are also additional protections for employees, including cybersecurity professionals, who speak up.

Brockmeier became chief operating officer of Central Rexall and Johnston became general counsel.
Johnston and Brockmeier caused approximately $100 million in fraudulent insurance claims for compounded medications that were not medically necessary.
The health care fraud and wire fraud conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense.
### Defense counsel: Johnston: Lawrence S. Lustberg, Anne Collart, and Andrew Marino, Esqs.","CAMDEN, N.J. – Two former executives of a Louisiana compounding pharmacy were found guilty of conspiring to use the pharmacy to defraud New Jersey and military health benefits programs of approximately $100 million, conspiring to commit identity theft in connection with the fraud, and conspiring to transact in the criminal proceeds, U.S. Attorney John Giordano announced.

Christopher Kyle Johnston, 46, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Trent Brockmeier, 62, of The Villages, Florida, were convicted on March 10, 2025 of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of conspiring to commit identity theft by fraudulently using a means of identification, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering by transacting in criminal proceeds following a six-week trial before U.S. District Judge Edward S. Kiel.

According to documents filed in this case and the evidence at trial:

Central Rexall Drugs was a pharmacy in Louisiana that prepared compounded medications, which are specialty medications mixed by a pharmacist to meet the specific medical needs of an individual patient. In 2013, Johnston and Brockmeier entered into an agreement to take over the management of the pharmacy and expand the compounding business in exchange for 90 percent of the profits. Brockmeier became chief operating officer of Central Rexall and Johnston became general counsel.

Johnston and Brockmeier learned that certain insurance plans would reimburse thousands of dollars for a one-month supply of certain compounded medications – including pain, scar, and antifungal creams, as well as vitamin combinations. The health plans for New Jersey state and local government and education employees, including teachers, firefighters, municipal police officers, and state troopers, covered these medications, as did TRICARE, which insures current and former members of the U.S. military and their families.

Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications and manipulated the ingredients in the medications in order to obtain high insurance reimbursements rather than serve the medical needs of patients. To determine which ingredients and combinations resulted in high insurance reimbursements, Johnston and Brockmeier directed Central Rexall employees to submit false prescription claims to test out different combinations of ingredients, but they did not have a valid prescription signed by a doctor for these formulas. Central Rexall submitted these false claims using, without their consent, individuals’ names, dates of birth, and identifying information (including insurance information) from pre-existing Central Rexall prescriptions.

By use of these false claims, Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications with combinations of ingredients that were chosen solely based on the amount of money that insurance would pay rather than on the medications’ ability to serve the medical needs of patients.

Johnston and Brockmeier retained and directed an outside sales force that used various methods to get doctors to prescribe these medications and patients to accept them, including having prescriptions signed without the patient seeing a doctor or knowing about the medications, having medications or refills ordered without the patients’ knowledge, paying patients to accept the medications, and paying doctors to prescribe them.

Johnston and Brockmeier caused approximately $100 million in fraudulent insurance claims for compounded medications that were not medically necessary. Johnston received approximately $34 million and Brockmeier received approximately $5 million in illicit profits.

50 people have been convicted or pled guilty in the overarching conspiracy.

The health care fraud and wire fraud conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit identity theft count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit money laundering charge carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense or not more than twice the amount of the criminally derived property involved in the transactions. Sentencing is scheduled for July 21, 2025.

U.S. Attorney John Giordano credited special agents of the FBI’s Atlantic City Resident Agency, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Terence G. Reilly in Newark; special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Tammy Tomlins in Newark; and the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to today’s conviction.

The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys R. David Walk, Jr. and Daniel A. Friedman of the Criminal Division.

This blood drive was “the type of drive that sustains the donor pool,” said Maj. Laze Stewart, chief of the ASBBC – PNW.
The ASBBC – PNW’s goal is to “host three to four blood drives per week on JBLM to ensure the Armed Services Blood Program and contingency shelf quota is met,” according to the organization.
Shankle’s unit, 1-51 ADA, was the top battalion/squadron represented at the blood drive, where it received 67 FOFS points.
For more information on the upcoming JBLM blood drives, visit: https://jblm.armymwr.com/calendar/event/96298","JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. – “Pretty good for my first day, right?”

Frank Wake, a medical lab technician with about 30 years of experience, joked with Spc. Cody Shankle, 1st Battalion, 51st Regiment, 1st Multi-Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, making him laugh despite just sticking him with a needle.

Wake helped collect Shankle’s blood March 6 at a blood drive at JBLM’s Soldiers Field House. Two more drives are planned for next month, including April 14 at Wilson Fitness Center and April 15 at McChord Fitness Center. Both will be held from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

A joint effort between JBLM's Armed Services Blood Bank Center – Pacific Northwest and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, the event brought in 113 registered donors and 88 good units of blood, said Emery Brake, public affairs, blood donor recruiter for the ASBBC – PNW, part of the Armed Services Blood Program.

The ASBP’s mission is “to provide quality blood products and services for all worldwide customers in peace and war,” and its requirements are to support combatant commands, Defense Health Agency medical treatment facilities and contingency blood for rapid deployments, according to ASBP data.

This blood drive was “the type of drive that sustains the donor pool,” said Maj. Laze Stewart, chief of the ASBBC – PNW.

However, more blood donations are still needed.

“The ASBBC-PNW has experienced a decrease in donations and is working toward meeting weekly quota requirements,” Brake said.

Service members face competing interests, including their hometown donation centers and other off-base centers that pay donors. The ASBBC – PNW tries to help people understand that the units of blood they collect “stay in-house, so to speak,” or stay within the armed services, Stewart said.

“To meet our quota requirements, we need to collect at minimum 150 donors a week, which would be around 550 donors a month,” according to a recent ASBBC – PNW command briefing slide. “Currently, we have very few months where we are hitting 500-plus donors. Until we achieve the Army Quota Mission each week and have excess, our support to Madigan (Army Medical Center) will not improve. Our priority is supplying our combatant commands who cannot source blood locally.”

Madigan is considered an ASBBC – PNW primary customer because of its level two trauma center status, “heavy schedule of routine surgeries and births” and anemia and cancer clinics, Stewart said.

The ASBBC – PNW’s goal is to “host three to four blood drives per week on JBLM to ensure the Armed Services Blood Program and contingency shelf quota is met,” according to the organization.

“That’s us shooting for a typical drive to be between 40 and 50 people,” Stewart said. “The reality is the turnout’s just not always what it should be.”

According to an ASBBC – PNW donor pamphlet, “almost 40% of the U.S. population is eligible to donate. Only 5% do.”

But March 6, MWR at JBLM applied a competitive angle to the blood drive “that just brought them out in droves,” Stewart said.

Participants earned double Fields of Friendly Strife points for their units, and the same rule will be applied at the April 14 and 15 drives. FOFS events give active-duty service members and their families the opportunity to gain points for their units. The winning unit receives the FOFS Commander’s Cup at the end of the competition year. The competition is broken down into two divisions: Brigade/Group and Battalion/Squadron.

Shankle’s unit, 1-51 ADA, was the top battalion/squadron represented at the blood drive, where it received 67 FOFS points. The top brigade/group was the 1st MDTF with 81 points, Brake said.

Wake, a pending retiree, loves talking with service members at the events.

“The time spent with these guys is the best,” he said while working with Shankle. “They come in with giant hearts.”

And they did.

“I just like to give back and I just want to see what I can do to help,” Shankle said.

Private First Class Shana Malauulu, 1-51 ADA, donated blood for the first time.

“It’s going pretty well. I was nervous, but I think it’s pretty fast and easy,” she said. “I just wanted to help anyone that needed blood that had the same blood type as me.”

Army spouse and Rainier Inn Operations manager Lizzie Woods was another donor, participating with additional IHG Hotels staff members.

“Giving blood is a great cause,” she said. “I’ve done it my whole life.”

Specialist Michael Stutzman, 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, said he had “plenty to give.”

“It’s just a couple hours out of your day that could possibly save someone’s life, so why not?” he said.

Volunteers within the military community, including service members, their family members, Department of Defense civilians, federal employees and contractors can donate to the ASBBC – PNW. The mobile team will travel to units to host blood drives, and donation appointments are also available at the organization’s on-base location, 9904 E. Johnson St., on Lewis Main. Potential donors are asked to call the ASBBC – PNW at 253-968-1850 and leave a voice message to schedule an appointment; they will be called back to confirm.

Donors must be 17 and older and weigh at least 116 pounds to donate whole blood, although 16-year-olds are able to donate with parental consent, according to an ASBP donor pre-screening guide.

Network providers

Are you wondering which type of provider you should see? There are two main types of TRICARE providers: Network and non-network providers. Network providers have signed agreements to work directly with TRICARE, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook. Seeing a network provider has several important benefits. Network providers:

• Charge lower costs for your care and won’t surprise you with extra bills above what TRICARE allows

• Take care of filing your claims, which means less paperwork for you

• Have agreed to follow TRICARE’s rules and procedures for your care

Network providers are often your most affordable and convenient choice. You’ll only have to pay your cost-share to a network provider.

Non-network providers

Non-network providers can treat TRICARE beneficiaries, but they don’t have direct agreements with TRICARE. There are two types of non-network providers you should know about: participating non-network providers and non-participating providers.

Participating non-network providers will:

• Accept TRICARE’s payment rate for your care

• Only bill you for your share of the costs

• Handle your claims paperwork for you

Non-participating providers might:

• Charge you more than what TRICARE allows, resulting in higher out-of-pocket costs

• Ask for full payment before they treat you

• Expect you to file your own claims

Important: Remember to ask non-network providers if they’re TRICARE-authorized before getting care—even if they’ve accepted TRICARE in the past. If they aren’t TRICARE-authorized, TRICARE won’t pay for any part of your claim.

How to find a provider

You have several options to search for providers:

• Use the Find a Doctor search tool.

• Look through the complete provider network directories on the TRICARE website.

If you live in the West Region, your regional contractor is now TriWest Healthcare Alliance. You can access the TriWest provider directory.

If you live in the East Region, check out the Humana Military network provider directory.

If you live overseas, use the International SOS provider directory to locate nearby providers.

Note: TRICARE has a Preferred Provider Network in the Philippines. Non-network providers in the Philippines must be certified to be covered by TRICARE, except for emergency services. Providers in the PPN:

• Accept network copayments and cost-shares

• File claims for you

Learn more about getting care in the Philippines on the TRICARE website.

Rules for different TRICARE plans

Your TRICARE plan determines the rules for which providers you can see. Here’s what you need to know about each plan.

If you have TRICARE Select, TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, or TRICARE Young Adult - Select Option, you can:

• Visit any provider who is approved by TRICARE

If you have TRICARE Prime, including TRICARE Young Adult - Prime Option:

• You get routine care from an assigned or selected primary care manager.

• Your PCM may be at a military hospital or clinic or a civilian TRICARE network provider.

• You’ll need a referral for specialty care and some diagnostic services.

• Note: Do you live in the West Region? There is a referral approval waiver in place through March 31. This means you still need to get a referral for specialty care, but you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve the referral before seeing the specialist.

• You can use the point-of-service option to see a non-network provider, but you may have higher costs.

• Important: Do you live in the West Region? Through March 31, you won’t have to pay POS fees for care received from a non-network provider. The Defense Health Agency has issued a waiver for POS fees, as long as the provider is TRICARE-authorized. Starting April 1, if the provider is still a non-network provider and isn’t named on your referral or pre-authorization, you’ll need to pay POS fees.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote:

• You can see non-network providers if no network providers practice in your area.

If you have TRICARE For Life:

• Seeing a Medicare participating provider is the most cost-effective option. • Check out the Medicare provider directory to find participating providers near you.

• Medicare pays first.

• You can see any TRICARE-authorized provider.

Keeping costs low

You can take several steps to keep your healthcare costs down:

• Choose network providers whenever possible.

• Check if you need TRICARE’s approval before getting treatment.

• Ask providers if they’re TRICARE-authorized before making appointments.

• Learn and follow your plan’s specific rules about getting care.

Enroll in a health care flexible spending account: In a special enrollment period through March 31, active duty service members have the option of enrolling in a health care flexible spending account, a new benefit that could help defray their out-of-pocket health care costs.

A health care flexible spending account, or FSA, is a savings account that can be used to pay for items not covered by health or dental insurance.

Service members can contribute any amount between $100 and $3,300 in pretax earnings this year toward eligible health care expenses, and then submit receipts for those expenses to be reimbursed from their account. Each year, the Internal Revenue Service determines eligible expenses and contribution limits.

By contributing to FSAs, the taxable income decreases by the contribution amount. Savings average 30% on eligible health care expenses, according to the Federal Flexible Spending Account Prog?am, or FSAFEDS, which administers the FSA program for the Defense Department and other federal agencies. Visit www.fsafeds.gov for more information and to enroll.

Download health records from the Tricare Online Patient Portal: The TOL Patient Portal will be shut down on April 1 and replaced by the Defense Department’s new electronic health record, MHS Genesis. To keep a copy of legacy health records, beneficiaries must download them by March 31. All military hospitals and clinics have made the transition to MHS Genesis, and the previous records won’t transfer to MHS Genesis. However, providers will continue to have access to the complete health records, according to the Defense Health Agency.

Beneficiaries can also request a physical copy from their military hospital or clinic’s records management office by completing a request form in person, then returning at a later date to pick up the records. Starting April 1, to get access to your legacy records, you’ll have to complete this process.

To download the records, visit www.TRICAREOnline.com, and log in using the required credentials. The web page provides instructions.

Beneficiaries in the Tricare West Region must set up their payment with TriWest: Beneficiaries who pay for their Tricare coverage using a bank electronic funds transfer, credit card or debit card, must provide that information to the new West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Officials extended the deadline to March 31 following beneficiaries’ difficulty in accessing the TriWest web portal and other issues.

This affects certain beneficiaries enrolled in Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve. Officials have assured beneficiaries that if they pay by allotment, their allotments will be transferred automatically to TriWest from the previous contractor. That hasn’t happened for some people, Military Times previously reported, and beneficiaries should check their pay statements for allotment information. The payment requirement affects all West Region beneficiaries, including those in the six states that moved to the region: Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin.

Visit the TriWest secure portal at www.tricare.mil/west, select “Sign up as a new user or log in” and follow the instructions. For assistance, call TriWest’s customer service center at 888-874-9378.

The West Region referral waiver period ends soon, so use Tricare Prime referrals for specialty care before March 31: Amid issues with TriWest, officials temporarily suspended a rule requiring beneficiaries to get their referrals to specialists approved, essentially allowing Tricare West Prime beneficiaries to bypass TriWest in order to get specialty care. This is retroactive to Jan. 1. The waiver doesn’t apply to some inpatient care and some specialty care, such as applied behavior analysis or autism care demonstration services.

The process is different for those with referrals and authorizations issued before Jan. 1 by the previous contractor. Those will be accepted through their expiration date or June 30, whichever comes first.",https://www.navycrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-03-14 16:50:49.257887

Here’s what to know today.

Judges order thousands of fired federal workers to be reinstated

Dozens of agencies, departments and leaderships across the federal government that had terminated workers as part of their reduction-in-workforce efforts must temporarily reinstate those workers, a judge ruled yesterday.

U.S. District Judge James Bredar in Maryland wrote in his ruling, affecting thousands for former employees, that the government “gave no advance notice” when it conducted mass layoffs, which Bredar said is required. “There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively,” Bredar wrote.

This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.

The order applies to 12 departments and six agencies. They were given a deadline of before March 17 at 1 p.m. to reinstate the affected employees.

The ruling in Maryland came hours after another federal judge in California directed six federal departments to offer reinstatement to the thousands of probationary employees the Trump administration terminated “on or about February 13.” U.S. District Judge William Alsup said the Office of Personnel Management’s directive to fire all probationary employees, in a written memo and in a February phone call, was not legal. The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal in the case.

The Trump admin official absent from Ukraine-Russia talks

When Trump administration officials met with Russian and Ukrainian officials at two recent summits in Saudi Arabia, one person was noticeably absent: retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. He's too pro-Ukraine for Russian President Vladimir Putin's taste, a senior Russian official with direct knowledge of the Kremlin's thinking said. A U.S. official in the Trump administration also confirmed that Russia did not want Kellogg involved.

Instead, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is among the officials who have attended the critical meetings. Witkoff is also the one who traveled to Moscow to spend 3½ hours with Putin on Feb. 11 on a “trust building” assignment from Trump.

Where this leaves Kellogg, a staunch Trump loyalist who has written about what he called the Biden administration’s “incompetent” foreign policies, is unclear. Read the full story here.

Couple surprised with over $100,000 in retroactively denied medical claims

Navy veteran Harve Smith and his wife, Janice, said they were blindsided when Tricare, the military’s health care program, rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid several years ago. Now, the couple said they are considering using their retirement funds or remortgaging their home to clear the debt while fearing what comes next.

The ordeal began in January, when Harve Smith received a $470 bill for dermatologist visits in 2020 and soon after found out that Tricare had retroactively denied 26 more claims for a total of about $3,000 worth of services it had already reimbursed providers. Janice Smith then learned that Tricare had reversed approvals for at least 10 claims, totaling about $100,000, in the same time frame. Nine other claims that had once been marked as completed are also being re-processed.

It’s unclear what prompted the reversals, which appear to be legal under federal law, according to two health care attorneys. The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, did not say if it had overpaid or made an error or whether the couple’s case was unique. But Janice Smith is convinced she and her husband are not alone. “We can’t be the only ones in this position,” she said. Read the full story here.

This milestone signifies activation or establishment of the Department of Air Force's newest direct reporting unit headquarters, two intermediate medical readiness commands and six of seven medical wings. Planners are ready to begin aligning medical groups and medical Airmen under AFMEDCOM.

""This is a historic moment,"" said Maj. Gen. Sean Collins, AFMEDCOM commander. ""It has taken an incredible amount of effort from multiple organizations to reach this point. Our focus is to align our Airmen medics and medical support staff under their respective medical wings while delivering operational medical support to the warfighter will continue.""

DAF planners have been working to establish AFMEDCOM since the concept was approved in 2023. DAF leaders sought to reshape the operational medical capability and support to the warfighter while improving its partnership with the Defense Health Agency to provide quality health care to beneficiaries.

""The readiness mission has always been at the heart of the Air Force Medical Service,"" said U.S. Air and Space Force Surgeon General Lt. Gen. John DeGoes.

""Anyone can deliver health care, but if we're in uniform, the health care we deliver and the health care we support must be operationally relevant, on the ground, air or space"" U.S. Air and Space Force Surgeon General Lt. Gen. John DeGoes

AFMEDCOM represents the DAF's operational medical capability - medical Airmen who are organized, trained and equipped to be an organic part of the DAF's warfighting force elements. As the DAF optimizes for enhanced warrior readiness, its medical forces must be ready to provide the required support, DeGoes said.

""Whether at peace or during combat operations, the DAF's power and strength are unrivaled - it's fueled by the best military training and equipment, but injuries occur,"" said Chief Master Sgt. James Woods, medical enlisted force chief. ""Medical Airmen are essential to ensuring Airmen and Guardians are ready to fight and Medical Airmen are responsible for returning injured personnel to the fight so operations may continue. That is the primary focus in all we do … we ensure Airmen and Guardians are ready for operations.""

AFMEDCOM's primary purpose is focused on the warfighter in garrison and contingency operations and will continue DAF's partnership with the DHA. This partnership will ensure and enhance readiness for Airmen, Guardians and their families by receiving timely and quality medical care, whether assigned to installations supported by large or small military treatment facilities. It will also support DHA's congressionally mandated commitments to serve the larger beneficiary population.

AFMEDCOM leadership, working with DAF partners, have established a well-coordinated inter-command transfer sequence. This ICT will align medical Airmen and units into the Command. At final operating capability, AFMEDCOM will be the largest Direct Reporting Unit in DAF, providing command and control of its assigned personnel to execute DAF and Air Force Surgeon General readiness requirements.

""We're taking a conditions-based approach to ensure the effective transfer of personnel and responsibilities of AFMEDCOM,"" DeGoes said. ""We've had extensive conversations with leadership at all levels. The AFMS is a critical component of readiness and ensuring commanders have the medical support they need in garrison and operationally is essential.""

While each patient at Ona Treatment Center receives a fully personalized recovery plan, taking into account their unique circumstances and needs, there are several strategies commonly used in most recovery plans. The new report highlights how patients can be prepared, what they should expect during their visit, and several of the most effective recovery strategies.

Using a holistic approach, expert therapists view each new patient as a complex whole, and work to create strategies that can improve their physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Experts will work closely with each patient to determine their needs, and to create a personalized plan that works for them.

The treatment center uses a wide range of counseling styles, personal development courses, and other evidence-based practices to help each patient reach their maximum recovery potential. However, they also understand that while recovery may be easier for some individuals, it can also be complex or long-lasting for others, and their team also provides in-depth or continuing services for patients who may require them.

Ona Treatment Center also specializes in helping Individuals with a dual diagnosis, those who may also be suffering from conditions such as anxiety, PTSD, or depression, to access special recovery services that take into account the full scope of their condition. Their team believes that by treating both conditions together, they can help patients to recover faster and more fully.

An excerpt from the Ona Treatment Center website explains, “Every individual’s experience with addiction is distinct. Factors like personal history, mental health, and social environment shape each person’s journey. A one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate.

If you’re a TRICARE beneficiary considering Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy for mental health, you’re probably wondering if this treatment option is covered under your plan. This post breaks down everything you need to know about TRICARE coverage for TMS, including eligibility requirements, the approval process, and steps to verify your coverage.

What is TMS Therapy?

TMS is a non-invasive, FDA-approved treatment primarily used for depression. It involves stimulating nerve cells in the brain using magnetic fields to improve mood and alleviate symptoms when other treatments have not worked. For active military members, veterans, and their families, TMS can provide an alternative to traditional medications.

Does TRICARE Cover TMS Therapy?

Yes, TRICARE covers TMS therapy, but with certain conditions. Coverage depends on the specific TRICARE plan you have, and it’s important to meet the medical necessity criteria. For instance, TMS is typically approved after other treatments like medications or psychotherapy have been ineffective. To receive coverage, you must go through a thorough evaluation by a healthcare provider, and an authorization process may be required.

Clear, Detailed Steps for Verifying TRICARE Coverage for TMS Therapy

Make and attend an initial intake appointment. During this appointment your provider will work with you to determine whether TMS therapy is right for you.

Provide your insurance information to our in-office insurance specialist: Our office will submit the necessary information to Tricare on your behalf and begin the prior authorization process to get approval for TMS therapy.

Maintain communication with our office: At times, additional information is needed from you. Providing our office with this information in a timely manner helps ensure your paperwork is submitted as soon as possible. Once Tricare approves the prior authorization request, our office will contact you to get your treatments started.

Real Patient Testimonials

Here’s what some TRICARE beneficiaries say about their experience with TMS therapy:

“I had struggled with depression for years and tried multiple medications, but nothing worked. TRICARE helped me access TMS therapy, and it’s been life-changing. I finally feel like myself again!” – Sarah M., Veteran

“I was skeptical at first, but after seeing how much my depression lifted with TMS, I’m grateful TRICARE covered the treatment.” – John D., Active Duty Military

Cost Comparison: With and Without Insurance

Understanding the financial aspect of TMS therapy is crucial for planning. Without insurance, the cost of a complete TMS treatment course can range from $6,000 to $12,000. However, with TRICARE coverage, patients only need to pay a portion of the cost, and may pay as little as zero dollars for a full course of TMS therapy.

To get an accurate estimate, verify the details with your TRICARE provider before beginning treatment.

If you’re considering TMS therapy, don’t wait. Start by checking your TRICARE coverage today, consult with your healthcare provider, and take the first step towards accessing the care you deserve.

On Your Side: Healthcare changes cause delays and frustrations for military families

By Ashley Reynolds KYTV News

Mar. 13, 2025

“It all has to do with a recent change to what’s known as Tricare. That’s the military’s health care program. On January 1, Tricare began delivering health care with TriWest. It was supposed to cut costs and improve access. Military families and providers tell On Your Side the transition is chaos. There’s a backlog of referrals and payments. If those clinics don’t get paid, the doors won’t stay open to help our soldiers and their families.”

“The disruptions impact nearly ten million people, including those at Fort Leonard Wood, who should receive secure medical, mental, and behavioral services.”

Welcome Home Troops

Ask a recruiter:

“To me, this ain’t fair. It’s a kick to the groin. You serve your country, and your country doesn’t care about you or your family, and that hurts. And I know I’m not the only one who thinks that either,” said Hansen.

“On Your Side emailed TriWest asking for an on-camera interview. TriWest didn’t answer the request but asked for Buehre’s contact information. We gave it. We asked for an interview again and again and never heard back.”

“Hold times in the beginning were two to five hours depending on the time of the day and day of the week. They tell us that their system was not equipped for all of the services and the number of participants,” said Buehre.

If you did your homework back in May of 2024, you remember:

“We are committed to keeping all of our military families informed about your health plan, your choices, and ensuring a seamless transition to new contractors,” said Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, director of the DHA.

Q&A: What To Know as New TRICARE Contracts Begin in 2025

By TRICARE Communications

Original deadline:

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) and the two regional contractors in the East Region and West Region are currently transitioning to these new contracts to ensure health care delivery is ready for all beneficiaries on Jan. 1, 2025.

“…new contracts will improve health care delivery, quality, and access for beneficiaries living in the United States.”

History of problems in 2025:

TRICARE “…a seamless transition…”

7 Years Back:

Pick a decade anytime after the war in Vietnam. No matter what political party or personality is in the White House, Uncle Sam struggles to get veterans health care to work properly. Moms, Dads, Grandparents, and young people have access to this info.

Recruiting crisis for Uncle Sam? Elected officials and top Pentagon Generals earned it.

From a Jan 14th blog:

Elected officials:

Stop kissing veteran ass on Armistice Day and every other chance you get. Stop with the “Thanks for your service” nonsense.

People volunteered to go to far away places and maybe never come back again.

Go to work to smooth out the process they face when they need to call and manage whatever benefits they earned.

Older veterans have influence with kids, grandkids and younger members of the community. Do right by them if you ever hope to dig out of your US Armed Forces recruiting crisis.

This whole thing should be no more tricky to use than an Amazon account.

Maybe the new administration will get this all cleared up soon, but we’re not there yet.

The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and usability of employing miEMA using a smartwatch for military service members undergoing traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation.Materials and methods: Twenty-eight United States active duty service members with a TBI history were recruited as patients from a military outpatient TBI rehabilitation center, enrolled in either a 2-week or 3-week study arm, and administered miEMA surveys via a custom smartwatch app. The 3-week arm participants were also concurrently receiving cognitive rehabilitation. Select constructs evaluated with miEMA included mood, fatigue, pain, headache, self-efficacy, and cognitive strategy use. Outcome measures of adherence were completion (percentage of questions answered out of questions delivered) and compliance (percentage of questions answered out of questions scheduled).

When the U.S. Army Reserve’s report on Card was released last summer, it was sent to the Center for Forensic Behavioral Science at Walter Reed Military Medical Center for expert analysis.

Speaking with reporters before officials made their report public last July, Lt. Gen. Jody Daniels, the former leader of the Army Reserve, was asked whether officials believed Card had a service-related traumatic brain injury.

""I am going to defer that to Walter Reed Medical Center,"" Daniels said during the briefing.

“We don’t know where this ends,” said Janice Smith, 67, who has multiple sclerosis and worries the stress will aggravate the autoimmune disorder.
Anxiety has kept Harve Smith, who served in the Navy for 15 years until 1994, from sleeping through the night.
“It just kept waking me up,” said Harve Smith, a former lieutenant commander.
The Defense Health Agency said the new contract would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries.","A Navy veteran and his wife said they were blindsided when Tricare, the military’s health care program, rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid several years ago.

Harve Smith, 71, received a $470 bill in January for dermatologist visits in 2020. He thought it was a one-off error until he discovered that Tricare had retroactively denied 26 more claims for a total of about $3,000 worth of services it had already reimbursed providers for since 2019, when he first enrolled in Tricare For Life, a plan for Tricare-eligible people who have Medicare.

Tricare also reversed approvals for at least 10 claims, totaling about $100,400, for his wife, Janice, in the same time frame, while nine other claims that had once been marked as completed are being re-processed, according to records from her Tricare portal, which NBC News reviewed.

“We don’t know where this ends,” said Janice Smith, 67, who has multiple sclerosis and worries the stress will aggravate the autoimmune disorder.

The couple, who live in Fallon, Nevada, said they would have to use their retirement funds or remortgage their home, which they fully own, to clear the debt. Anxiety has kept Harve Smith, who served in the Navy for 15 years until 1994, from sleeping through the night.

“It just kept waking me up,” said Harve Smith, a former lieutenant commander. “Did I do something wrong?”

It is unclear what prompted the reversals, which appear to be legal under federal law, according to two health care attorneys.

In Nevada, recoupment time frames are usually set by contracts between private health insurers and providers, Las Vegas-based attorney Ayesha Mehdi said. The contracts often allow insurers to recoup payments within a year or two and sometimes four years, she said.

But because federal law is stronger than state law, Mehdi said, Tricare, a federal program, is allowed to rescind payments under its regulations, which permit recovery for up to 10 years in cases of overpayment or mistakes.

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, did not say whether it had overpaid or made an error or whether the couple’s case was unique. Spokesperson Brenda Campbell said that it cannot comment publicly on individual health cases but that it would work with the Smiths to investigate further.

Health Net Federal Services, the former contractor for the Tricare west region, also said it could not comment on specific cases, citing health privacy laws, but it said it is “actively looking into the matter.”

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, which took over the contract this year, deferred comment to Health Net, which it said is responsible for processing and paying claims before Jan. 1. TriWest said it has not recouped or tried to recoup any payments from the Smiths and is not allowed to take such actions under its contract with the Defense Health Agency.

After having spent weeks calling the agencies and being bounced around between departments, the Smiths said, they have not gotten clarity.

Meanwhile, the $470 bill from the dermatologist has already gone to collections. The Feb. 7 collections notification, which was reviewed by NBC News, instructs Harve Smith to pay the balance within the next 30 days or face adverse credit reporting.

The Smiths said they do not plan to pay the bills out of pocket until they have confirmation that it is their responsibility to do so.

Documents in Harve Smith’s Tricare portal, which NBC News also reviewed, show that Tricare did issue payments to the dermatologist in 2020.

Janice Smith said: “It has been so stressful, and it is so scary. We can’t be the only ones in this position.”

Millions of service members, retirees, their families and network providers nationwide have felt cascading disruptions following Tricare’s contract changes this year.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid this year, officials said, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

On Jan. 1, TriWest began managing Tricare benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region. The Defense Health Agency said the new contract would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries. But it has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since then.

The Smiths said it took weeks of calling Tricare before anyone picked up the phone. During one attempt, they said, they waited on hold for over two hours.

“I was so exhausted. I just started crying,” Janice Smith said.

She said they called Tricare For Life, which is Tricare’s Medicare program, but were redirected to at least three other numbers. When they finally reached a representative for the military’s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System database, which holds information for every service member, Janice Smith said, they were told the officials had to manually fix her husband’s records.

The Smiths said database system did not elaborate on what was wrong with his records or what caused the apparent error. They were told to complete a Tricare form asking to reinstate their enrollment, even though they did not know whether they had been removed.

In the meantime, they do not know whether they currently have health care coverage and whether they are on the hook to repay all of the claims out of pocket.

Janice Smith said Tricare had initially approved her and her husband’s services, which included brain scans to monitor her condition, hip replacement surgery, physical therapy and annual checkups.

“We’re not going to pay. We are not in the wrong,” she said. “We were covered. We had insurance.”

The Smiths, who have been married for 42 years, had been enjoying their retirement and spending their time visiting their daughters in Hawaii and Virginia.

They said the claims reversals, which have triggered at least two medical bills so far, have caused them to live more frugally, limiting their travel and even lunch dates.

“We were the epitome of footloose and fancy-free,” Janice Smith said. “Now we have this looming over us.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250312-3x2-smith-family-vl-130p-cf927e.jpg",N,-1.0,2025-03-13 18:50:26.772053

Keep reading to learn about provider types and how to find a provider.

Network providers

Are you wondering which type of provider you should see? There are two main types of TRICARE providers: Network and non-network providers. Network providers have signed agreements to work directly with TRICARE, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook. Seeing a network provider has several important benefits. Network providers:

Charge lower costs for your care and won’t surprise you with extra bills above what TRICARE allows

Take care of filing your claims, which means less paperwork for you

Have agreed to follow TRICARE’s rules and procedures for your care

Network providers are often your most affordable and convenient choice. You’ll only have to pay your cost-share to a network provider.

Non-network providers

Non-network providers can treat TRICARE beneficiaries, but they don’t have direct agreements with TRICARE. There are two types of non-network providers you should know about: participating non-network providers and non-participating providers.

Participating non-network providers will:

Accept TRICARE’s payment rate for your care

Only bill you for your share of the costs

Handle your claims paperwork for you

Non-participating providers might:

Charge you more than what TRICARE allows, resulting in higher out-of-pocket costs

Ask for full payment before they treat you

Expect you to file your own claims

Important: Remember to ask non-network providers if they’re TRICARE-authorized before getting care—even if they’ve accepted TRICARE in the past. If they aren’t TRICARE-authorized, TRICARE won’t pay for any part of your claim.

How to find a provider

You have several options to search for providers:

Use the Find a Doctor search tool.

Look through the complete provider network directories on the TRICARE website.

If you live in the West Region, your regional contractor is now TriWest Healthcare Alliance. You can access the TriWest provider directory.

If you live in the East Region, check out the Humana Military network provider directory.

If you live overseas, use the International SOS provider directory to locate nearby providers.

Note: TRICARE has a Preferred Provider Network in the Philippines. Non-network providers in the Philippines must be certified to be covered by TRICARE, except for emergency services. Providers in the PPN:

Accept network copayments and cost-shares

File claims for you

Learn more about getting care in the Philippines on the TRICARE website.

Rules for different TRICARE plans

Your TRICARE plan determines the rules for which providers you can see. Here’s what you need to know about each plan.

If you have TRICARE Select, TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, or TRICARE Young Adult - Select Option, you can:

Visit any provider who is approved by TRICARE

If you have TRICARE Prime, including TRICARE Young Adult - Prime Option:

You get routine care from an assigned or selected primary care manager.

Your PCM may be at a military hospital or clinic or a civilian TRICARE network provider.

You’ll need a referral for specialty care and some diagnostic services.

Note: Do you live in the West Region? There is a referral approval waiver in place through March 31. This means you still need to get a referral for specialty care, but you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve the referral before seeing the specialist.

You can use the point-of-service option to see a non-network provider, but you may have higher costs.

Important: Do you live in the West Region? Through March 31, you won’t have to pay POS fees for care received from a non-network provider. The Defense Health Agency has issued a waiver for POS fees, as long as the provider is TRICARE-authorized. Starting April 1, if the provider is still a non-network provider and isn’t named on your referral or pre-authorization, you’ll need to pay POS fees.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote:

You can see non-network providers if no network providers practice in your area.

If you have TRICARE For Life:

Seeing a Medicare participating provider is the most cost-effective option. Check out the Medicare provider directory to find participating providers near you.

Medicare pays first.

You can see any TRICARE-authorized provider.

Keeping costs low

You can take several steps to keep your healthcare costs down:

Choose network providers whenever possible.

Check if you need TRICARE’s approval before getting treatment.

Ask providers if they’re TRICARE-authorized before making appointments.

Learn and follow your plan’s specific rules about getting care.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/13/2003666774/1920/1080/0/250313-O-D0202-1001.JPG,N,0.0,2025-03-13 15:50:27.668812

(HNFS), a government contractor that provides TRICARE healthcare management services to active duty military members and their families. HNFS as well as its parent corporation Centene agreed to pay just over $11 million to resolve alleged false claims submitted to the U.S. Department of Defense.

While American values dictate that we thank service members for their role in protecting our freedoms, this government contractor instead chose to submit false claims in order to keep up their deal with the Department of Defense. Ultimately, it was taxpayers who footed the bill for fraud and false claims with government contractors. Taxpayers should never pay for shoddy services, especially not when it comes to healthcare and protecting personal and sensitive data relating to military members and their families.

The Allegations Against Health Net Federal Services, LLC and Centene Corporation

According to the DOJ, parent corporation Centene and its subsidiary Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) failed to meet these minimum cybersecurity protocols between the period of 2015 and 2018 while providing data management services to the U.S. Department of Defense through its administration of TRICARE. HNFS may have exposed U.S. service members’ personal and health data, as well as that of their families, due to failing to scan for known vulnerabilities and patching known security flaws. The networks and systems maintained by HNFS during this three year period were reported by third party security auditors as well as the company’s own internal audit department for being inadequate in terms of:

Asset management

Access controls

Flawed configuration settings

Weak firewalls or lack of firewalls in use

End-of-life hardware and software in place

Lack of patch management

Vulnerability scanning

Shoddy password policies

HFNS not only allegedly failed to install updates from vendors that would have countered known threats; they also allegedly falsely certified compliance with annual reports to DHA in order to keep their government contract with TRICARE. In order to resolve these allegations, the company Centene Corporation, which acquired all shares of HFNS as well as its liabilities, has agreed to pay $11,253,400. The matter was resolved in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California, as well as with assistance from the DoD Office of Inspector General, the DCIS, Cyber Field Office Western Region, the Inspector General’s Office of Audits, Cyberspace Operations Directorate, and the DoD’s Defense Contract Management Agency, Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center.

What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a federal health insurance program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense and its contracts. TRICARE provides healthcare coverage to qualifying members of the U.S. military and their families, including:

Active duty service members and their families

National Guard and Reserve members and families

Medal of Honor recipients and their families

Survivors

Children

Former spouses

TRICARE is similar to Medicare in that it is a primary health insurance provider funded by taxpayer dollars and administered by a federal agency. While Medicare covers older Americans ages 65 and up, TRICARE provides medical, dental, and pharmacy coverage for U.S. military members, veterans, and family members. Because of this, TRICARE also maintains personal and sensitive data for military members, including some confidential location information for active duty personnel. Like all health data, TRICARE records include HIPAA-protected information and other confidential information, which can be exposed to data breaches by criminal hackers and contractors who do not take their cybersecurity obligations seriously. TRICARE breaches are especially troubling because they can lead to the unlawful dissemination of protected information that compromises individual health privacy and potentially national security.

Federal Healthcare Programs Are Vulnerable to Cybersecurity Breaches

Acting U.S. Attorney Michele Beckwith for the Eastern District of California spoke about the HNFS settlement, saying “Safeguarding sensitive government information, particularly when it relates to the health and well-being of millions of service members and their families, is of paramount importance. When HNFS failed to uphold its cybersecurity obligations, it didn’t just breach its contract with the government, it breached its duty to the people who sacrifice so much in defense of our nation.”

Both healthcare and defense spending for government contracts are two of the most at-risk areas for fraud, waste, and abuse. Taxpayers lose billions of dollars every year to government contractors and healthcare organizations that take advantage of federal healthcare programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, with an estimated 10% of program expenses at risk. Meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office reports that the U.S. Department of Defense is particularly vulnerable to false or fraudulent claims involving overbilling, billing for work never performed or services not rendered to beneficiaries, fraudulent bid submissions, non-competitive bids, the provisions of substandard parts or services, and the failure to disclose data breaches and other cybersecurity risks.

How Whistleblowers Can Protect Americans Through the False Claims Act

Under the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative, private companies that contract with the federal government are obligated to uphold certain minimum cybersecurity standards. When they fail to do so, or falsely certify compliance with cybersecurity requirements, they can be held accountable under the False Claims Act for treble damages and penalties to the federal government. Through a qui tam lawsuit, whistleblowers who report on these kinds of violations can also receive a percentage of the government’s total recovery. These percentages can range from 10% to 30% of the final settlement. The False Claims Act imposes treble damages upon violators, as well as individual penalties for each false claims of up to $13,946 to $27,894 per violation. The law also allows whistleblowers (known as relators) who meet certain eligibility requirements and are the first to report cybersecurity fraud, government contractor fraud including DOD fraud, or healthcare fraud a reward for their inside information.

Whistleblowers can come from all walks of life and may include current or former employees of any potential defendant such as employees of government contractors, health care entities, or any regulated company, non-employees (examiners, competitors, clients, customers, auditors, reviewers, consultants, industry experts), anyone with evidence and knowledge of fraud involving government money. As long as you come forward willingly and in a timely manner you may be able to bring a qui tam case with the help of a qui tam lawyer and recover a reward. There are also additional protections for employees, including cybersecurity professionals, who speak up. These may include:

The option to initially report anonymously through a qui tam law firm

A federal right of action to sue for reinstatement if you are fired from your company as a result of your protected disclosure

Up to double back pay with interest from the period during which you were demoted, suspended, or let go

Possible front pay, in cases where reinstatement is not possible

Additional damages and attorneys’ fees.",https://yr2khqfq.cdn.imgeng.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/soldier-in-doctor-office.jpeg,N,-1.0,2025-03-13 18:50:37.798178

However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike.","WASHINGTON — Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr announced today the launch of the Council for National Security within the agency aimed at fending off foreign bad actors, particularly China.

“Today, the country faces a persistent and constant threat from foreign adversaries, particularly the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],” Carr said in a news release today. “These bad actors are always exploring ways to breach our networks, devices, and technology ecosystem. It is more important than ever that the FCC remain vigilant and protect Americans and American companies from these threats.”

The council will be headed by Adam Chan, a former associate at the Boyden Gray PLLC law firm, per the release.

Today’s announcement outlines three focus areas for the council. The first is to reduce the US’s dependencies on foreign adversaries regarding tech and telecommunications supply chains. Second is to “mitigate” the US’s vulnerabilities to surveillance, espionage and cyberattacks. Lastly, the council will “ensure” that the US outpaces China in its race to develop and deploy “critical technologies” such as 5G, 6G, artificial intelligence, satellites and space, quantum, robotics, autonomous systems, and the internet of things.

The FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are the two organizations responsible for setting US spectrum policy, and governing which users get access when to what bandwidths for what functions. The FCC regulates commercial spectrum usage while the NTIA is responsible for advocating for spectrum usage for military departments.

The announcement comes against the background of a tug-of-war between commercial providers and the Defense Department over usage of key parts of the spectrum, specifically between the 1 GhZ (gigahertz) to 6 GHz range, which makes up the 3.1-3.45 and 3.5 GHz S-band — widely considered to be the “Goldilocks” zone of the spectrum.

The DoD has contended that this part of the spectrum band is essential for its various satellite communications, radars and navigation systems. However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike.

When it comes to the fight over the spectrum, John Sherman, former DoD chief information officer and now dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, previously told Breaking Defense that “it is a zero sum game” for the DoD.

“There is finite spectrum, and the physics of the spectrum, about the desirability of the lower [3 GHz band] both for our target acquisition radars and for 5G, this makes it very difficult,” he said.",https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_antenna_network_GettyImages-1306156001-scaled-e1660843825841-1024x576.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-13 15:50:32.497445

One of the main benefits of Scheduled Virtual Visits is that it can save patients time and enables them to access care when it is convenient for them.
“I feel like Scheduled Virtual Visits capability is pretty easy to use and it flows,” said Rachel Milnark, a registered nurse in the occupational health clinic at Munson.
Another provider in the occupational health section uses Scheduled Virtual Visits to complete the “Part 2” portion of occupational health exams for preplacement and replacement physicals for employees on post.
Some conditions suitable for Scheduled Virtual Visits may include skin conditions, urinary and sinus infections, pink eye, review of test results and specialist reports, medication management, cold and flu, and follow-ups.","FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas, -- A new virtual healthcare delivery platform available from Munson Army Health Center called Scheduled Virtual Visits is already making a positive difference during its initial trial.

“We are in the process of a very deliberate roll-out of this virtual health platform and so far, the feedback has been very good from both patients and staff,” said Col. Jolanda L.J. Walker, director of Munson Army Health Center, which adopted the application last month. The virtual healthcare technology is part of the Defense Health Agency care model called My Military Health.

One of the main benefits of Scheduled Virtual Visits is that it can save patients time and enables them to access care when it is convenient for them. All it takes is a smartphone, tablet, or computer with internet, video and audio capabilities.

“It is not a replacement for in-person health care, but an additional option for our beneficiaries to choose from when medically appropriate,” said Walker. “Patients may always choose an in-person visit if they prefer.”

Munson is currently using the platform for behavioral health and occupational health appointments.

Instead of patients coming to the health center, they can see their care team using this secure technology.

“I feel like Scheduled Virtual Visits capability is pretty easy to use and it flows,” said Rachel Milnark, a registered nurse in the occupational health clinic at Munson. “All the patient has to do is click on the link we provide when it is time for their appointment, and they will be virtually connected to their provider.”

Milnark has been using the system to complete annual screening for childcare providers at the installation’s day care facilities.

“This new system allows CYS staff to take care of occupational health appointments with minimal disruption. They can complete a 15-minute requirement in 15 minutes, rather than leaving the childcare facility, traveling to Munson to visit the occupational health clinic in person and eventually heading back. That can take a lot longer,” said Milnark.

Another provider in the occupational health section uses Scheduled Virtual Visits to complete the “Part 2” portion of occupational health exams for preplacement and replacement physicals for employees on post.

“We have sped up the process from weeks to days for some exams, because the patient is only required to be here one time versus having to come in multiple times,” said Maj. Meredith Steggerda, Munson’s chief of Public Health, which includes the occupational health mission for the installation.

“I’m seeing a lot of good opportunities for this,” said Walker.

She said that she intends to expand the platform into the primary care setting soon.

“We are currently exploring all the possibilities and establishing protocols for implementation at our level -- ensuring our providers have the training and technology to use the platform as intended,” said Walker.

Some conditions suitable for Scheduled Virtual Visits may include skin conditions, urinary and sinus infections, pink eye, review of test results and specialist reports, medication management, cold and flu, and follow-ups.

About Paxlovid

Paxlovid is a prescription-only oral antiviral medication containing nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. It treats mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and is particularly effective if you are unvaccinated.

Nirmatrelvir helps to stop a key enzyme from working that the coronavirus needs to multiply. Ritonavir slows the breakdown of nirmatrelvir, enhancing its effects.

Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in older adults by 44%.

It is important to discuss Paxlovid with your doctor or healthcare professional, as there are many possible drug interactions.

Additionally, you may experience side effects when taking Paxlovid, which could include:

allergic reactions

a change in your taste

diarrhea

headache

liver conditions

Planners are ready to begin aligning medical groups and medical Airmen under AFMEDCOM.
“The readiness mission has always been at the heart of the Air Force Medical Service,” said Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and Space Force Surgeon General.
“Medical Airmen are essential to ensuring Airmen and Guardians are ready to fight, and Medical Airmen are responsible for returning injured personnel to the fight so operations may continue.
The Air Force Medical Service is a critical component of readiness and ensuring commanders have the medical support they need in garrison and operationally is essential.”","The Air Force Medical Command achieved its initial operational capability March 12, 2025.

This milestone signifies activation or establishment of the Department of Air Force’s newest direct reporting unit headquarters, two intermediate medical readiness commands, and six of seven medical wings. Planners are ready to begin aligning medical groups and medical Airmen under AFMEDCOM.

“This is a historic moment,” said Maj. Gen. Sean Collins, AFMEDCOM commander. “It has taken an incredible amount of effort from multiple organizations to reach this point. Our focus to align our Airmen medics and medical support staff under their respective medical wings while delivering operational medical support to the warfighter will continue.”

DAF planners have been working to establish AFMEDCOM since the concept was approved in 2023. DAF leaders sought to reshape the operational medical capability and support to the warfighter while improving its partnership with the Defense Health Agency to provide quality health care to beneficiaries.

“The readiness mission has always been at the heart of the Air Force Medical Service,” said Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and Space Force Surgeon General. “Anyone can deliver health care, but if we’re in uniform, the health care we deliver and the health care we support must be operationally relevant, on the ground, air or space.”

AFMEDCOM represents the DAF’s operational medical capability - medical Airmen who are organized, trained and equipped to be an organic part of the DAF’s warfighting force elements. As the DAF optimizes for enhanced warrior readiness, its medical forces must be ready to provide the required support, said DeGoes.

“Whether at peace or during combat operations, the Department of Air Force’s power and strength are unrivaled - it’s fueled by the best military training and equipment, but injuries occur,” said Chief Master Sgt. James Woods, Chief, Medical Enlisted Force. “Medical Airmen are essential to ensuring Airmen and Guardians are ready to fight, and Medical Airmen are responsible for returning injured personnel to the fight so operations may continue. That is the primary focus in all we do … we ensure Airmen and Guardians are ready for operations.”

AFMEDCOM’s primary purpose is focused on the warfighter in garrison and contingency operations, AFMEDCOM will continue DAF’s partnership with the DHA. This partnership will ensure and enhance readiness for Airmen, Guardians and their families by receiving timely and quality medical care, whether assigned to installations supported by large or small military treatment facilities. It will also support DHA’s congressionally mandated commitments to serve the larger beneficiary population.

AFMEDCOM leadership, working with DAF partners, have established a well-coordinated inter-command transfer sequence. This ICT will align medical Airmen and units into the Command. At final operating capability, AFMEDCOM will be the largest DRU in DAF providing command and control of its assigned personnel to execute DAF and AF/SG readiness requirements.

“We’re taking a conditions-based approach to ensure the effective transfer of personnel and responsibilities of AFMEDCOM,” said DeGoes. “We’ve had extensive conversations with leadership at all levels. The Air Force Medical Service is a critical component of readiness and ensuring commanders have the medical support they need in garrison and operationally is essential.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2202/7059355/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-13 11:50:18.651677

Tricare, TriWest and Humana Military have taken some actions to start to address the issues.","This article by Karen Jowers originally appeared on Military Times, the nation's largest independent newsroom dedicated to covering the military and veteran community.

A retired Marine staff sergeant recently took steps to ensure he and his wife don’t lose their health care coverage after his allotment for Tricare payments was mistakenly stopped during the military’s transition to the new contracts in January.

Russ Clark is worried that other people have been affected, too, and could unknowingly be at risk of losing their coverage.

He’s concerned that other beneficiaries aren’t checking their pay statements from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service or their bank statements and could lose coverage if their allotment has also been discontinued.

“Others may not have noticed the allotment being stopped, as it was at the same time we got our [Cost of Living Adjustment] pay increase, so someone may be thinking that the increase in the monthly paycheck was just the COLA increase,” Clark told Military Times.

[TELL US: Have You Faced Health Care Access Barriers? Share Your Story With MOAA]

Certain beneficiaries pay for Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve plans. Clark pays for Tricare Prime coverage.

The problem came about during the Jan. 1 transition of Tricare West Region beneficiaries from the previous contractor, Health Net Federal Services, to the new one, TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Tricare officials repeatedly assured West Region beneficiaries who make recurring payments by allotment that their information would be transferred automatically.

That wasn’t true for Clark.

Clark’s December pay statement showed his allotment to Tricare was stopped. During calls to Tricare and DFAS, they “assured me that I didn’t have anything to worry about,” he said.

As of March 7, the allotment has yet to be restarted. He has been making payments online to ensure he maintains coverage.

“I will pay month to month until I feel certain that DFAS won’t start this allotment again,” Clark said.

[RELATED: Here’s Why You Should Download Your Military Health Records Before April 1]

In a few months, he plans to set up auto pay using a credit card.

“We certainly apologize for any inconvenience caused by any issue with payment,” officials with the Defense Health Agency said in an email response to questions. “That said, this doesn’t seem to be a widespread issue, but for anyone who may be having issues with their payment by allotment ... check with your respective managed care support contractor.”

The contractors are TriWest Healthcare Alliance in the West Region and Humana Military in the East Region. Information wasn’t available from TriWest officials regarding the allotments, and DFAS officials referred the questions to Tricare.

[RELATED: MOAA's TRICARE Guide]

Military Times heard from other beneficiaries who faced a problem with their Tricare payments that differed from Clark’s. They previously made Tricare payments by credit card and suddenly, allotments started coming out of their paychecks without prior notification — and without their authorization.

These problems are aside from those experienced by beneficiaries who previously made their Tricare payments by electronic fund transfer, credit card or debit card. Those beneficiaries are required to set up their payments with TriWest because the sensitive financial information can’t be transferred between the contractors.

But many of those beneficiaries have encountered problems setting up their recurring payments. So, Tricare extended the deadline to March 31 for beneficiaries to input their recurring payment information. Those who miss this deadline will lose coverage back to Jan. 1, Tricare officials have warned. Beneficiaries looking to update TriWest with their payment information should visit www.tricare.mil/west.

The transition to the new contracts has been a troubled one for many military families and health care providers. Families have experienced difficulties with setting up their payments, finding in-network health care providers and getting referrals and authorizations processed. They’ve also endured long wait times with the TriWest call center.

In the East Region, health care providers have faced problems with receiving reimbursements, putting some at risk of closing their doors. A number have dropped Tricare patients because of the lack of payments.

Tricare, TriWest and Humana Military have taken some actions to start to address the issues.

TRICARE’s problems go beyond ASHA members. Several thousand TRICARE providers from many different specialties are struggling to provide care while patients deal with long wait times and delayed authorizations.

What ASHA Advocacy Is Doing

The ASHA Advocacy team is deeply concerned about this situation and knows that providers cannot continue to provide services when they cannot get paid or file claims. We are working to help ASHA members resolve these issues.

ASHA Advocacy collected stories from over 150 ASHA members and used this information to send letters to TRICARE West, TRICARE East, and the Defense Health Agency. ASHA met with TriWest Health Alliance on March 5 and stressed that these problems are putting providers in dire straits. Many have had to discontinue services for TRICARE patients and are unable to accept new TRICARE patients. Others are taking out personal loans to make payroll and in some cases shuttering their practices.

TriWest Health Alliance shared that it has hired hundreds of new employees to clear the claims backlog and respond to provider inquiries. ASHA Advocacy will continue to push for timely and efficient claims processing.

We are working closely with other health care provider associations to elevate our voice on this issue. We’re also sharing your stories with interested lawmakers who are tackling the issue in Congress.

“The Walter Reed we’re excited to get behind now saved her life.” He pushed back against the notion that private-sector healthcare is always superior.
“The family we have here at Walter Reed and the care that you receive here [show] our commitment,” he said.
“As we go forward, we want to make sure you have the resources to do what you need to do,” Selnick assured Walter Reed staff.","BETHESDA, Md. — Senior Department of Defense officials engaged directly with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center staff during a Senior Leaders Forum on March 7, addressing concerns ranging from military medical readiness to workforce reductions and efficiency improvements.

Darin Selnick, Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, fielded questions and reinforced Walter Reed's critical role in military healthcare.

Mr. Selnick said it’s important for leaders to conduct site visits and listen to feedback from staff. “Health care equals military readiness,” he said.

Walter Reed’s leadership, including Director U.S. Navy Capt. Melissa C. Austin, underscored the institution’s role as the military health system's premier medical center. “Rebuilding that sense of ‘We are the President’s Hospital, the flagship of the Military Health System, and where we lead, everyone else follows’ takes time,” Austin said. She emphasized that while facility challenges exist, Walter Reed also tackles broader concerns to enhance patient care and workplace morale. “Given the appropriate latitude at my level to perform—top-down and bottom-up—we have the opportunity to make this a much more efficient place that will make staff excited to come to work,” she said.

U.S. Navy Capt. Juan Rosario, Walter Reed’s chief of staff, provided a personal testament to the hospital’s lifesaving care. “In 2018, my family came here after we were stationed in Italy. My daughter was diagnosed with cancer,” Rosario shared. “The Walter Reed we’re excited to get behind now saved her life.”

He pushed back against the notion that private-sector healthcare is always superior. “The family we have here at Walter Reed and the care that you receive here [show] our commitment,” he said. “We are committed to making sure that the same care my daughter received is the care that every soldier, every Marine, every sailor, and every airman receives every day.”

Ferrara, a former Walter Reed clinician and interventional radiologist, reinforced the need for cohesive medical teams to maintain operational effectiveness. “The health care [system] is an ecosystem, and all things work as a unit,” Ferrara explained. “For a surgeon to wield the scalpel, you need a logistician to buy the scalpel, the patient admin person to check that patient in and generate a wristband. You need a biomed tech to make sure that the instruments are sterile. You need environmental services making sure that the hospital is clean and that infection control measures are met.”

Selnick stressed that patient confidence determines an institution’s success. “Patients will vote with their feet,” he said. “If you are quality, people will come from long distances and wait [to receive your care]. People will flee if there are long wait times and poor care. It’s the whole environment [of care].”

Ferrara emphasized that high-quality healthcare supports military readiness—ensuring service members can focus on their missions without concerns about their families’ well-being. “As we go forward, we want to make sure you have the resources to do what you need to do,” Selnick assured Walter Reed staff.

The town hall forum reaffirmed Walter Reed’s commitment to delivering world-class care while navigating institutional challenges, maintaining mission readiness, and upholding its legacy as the President’s Hospital since 1942.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8910784.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-13 04:50:48.314405

“I’ve been to several other facilities with [certified] dogs and they really help out with stress.
“The animal visitation program supports warfighter readiness by promoting mental health, reducing stress, and enhancing overall well-being,” said Cmdr.
Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay is a community-based medical treatment facility affiliated with Defense Health Agency.
The hospital provides health care to the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay community that consists of approximately 5,000 military, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors and their families.","GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba - Tongues – and tails – were wagging at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay as news traveled down the halls one paw at a time; it was official, the American Red Cross Animal Visitation Program kicked off, Jan. 22, 2025.

The inaugural visit began in the command suite boardroom surprising staff members when Chief Nursing Officer, Cmdr. Rebeca Rodriguez, had one last piece of business to share with the commanding officer and executive staff. Rodriguez opened the door and announced the hospital’s first certified canine visitors; Isabel, Knox and Apollo.

“I was completely surprised,” said Naval Hospital Director, Capt. Tammy Servies. “I vaguely remember someone said something about a surprise when I came back from leave, but I had no idea what it was. As a huge fan of dogs, I was very excited.”

A memorandum of agreement between Defense Health Agency and the American Red Cross allows certified animal visitation teams to provide visits to hospitalized patients, staff, and others in military medical treatment facilities.

“Animals have proven to be very beneficial to mental health in many studies,” said Servies. “I’ve been to several other facilities with [certified] dogs and they really help out with stress. I was excited that the Red Cross was offering this same benefit for our facility and jumped on the chance.”

Rodriguez, oversaw the details of bringing the program to the hospital.

“One of the duties I am entrusted with is the advocacy of not just patients, but everyone under the hospital umbrella,” said Rodriguez. “Therapy animals have been proven to assist with PTSD, high blood pressure, and increase morale and genuine levity during and after visits. I advocated for this program as one of the small things that can have a huge impact during someone’s day. Plus, it absolutely helps that our CO is an avid supporter of animals and loves dogs!”

Rodriguez described her own experience when she was visited by one of the dogs at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “Seeing the faces of patients and staff light up when Sully walked into a room was one of the best things. I witnessed sheer joy and could see and feel the tensions of the day melt away.”

Isabel, a 10-year-old Labrador retriever mix, is a certified therapy animal who frequently works with the Joint Stress Mitigation and Restoration Team (JSMART) at Joint Task Force Guantanamo. She has several handlers, but her owner and primary handler, Lt. Jyl Bean – a hospital employee assigned to U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay – accompanies her during hospital visits.

“Isabel and I went through her therapy training together. She was born for this work with her calm, soothing temperament,” said Bean. “She knows exactly how to bring comfort and connection to those who need it most and having her visit the hospital is just one more way she helps improve the well-being of our sailors.”

The handlers and their dogs toured through the hospital visiting with service members as Rodriguez discussed the areas where the dogs are welcome.

“The dogs are allowed to go into all areas that do not deal with food or sterility,” said Rodriguez. “If there is a request from staff or patients to avoid an area, we honor that request. The hope though is that they will spread their ‘pawsitive’ vibes throughout all areas of the hospital, including our outlying buildings.”

Patients are the focus and priority for the visits, but the healthcare providers benefit as well.

“The animal visitation program supports warfighter readiness by promoting mental health, reducing stress, and enhancing overall well-being,” said Cmdr. Derek Miletich, psychiatrist and behavioral health provider at the hospital.

“Interactions with certified therapy animals have been shown to lower blood pressure, improve mood, and alleviate anxiety—critical factors in maintaining focus and resilience,” Miletich added. “By providing emotional comfort and a sense of normalcy, the program helps service members and their families more optimally manage the challenges of military life, enabling them to remain mission-ready and perform at their best.”

The program can contribute to patient safety by promoting a calmer, more positive healing environment.

“Interacting with therapy animals has been shown to reduce anxiety and stress in patients, which can lower heart rates and blood pressure, supporting better recovery outcomes,” said Miletich. “A more relaxed state can also improve communication between patients and caregivers, creating a clearer understanding of medical instructions and treatment plans. Additionally, therapy animals can help improve emotional well-being, which is closely linked to adherence to treatment and overall patient cooperation, ultimately reducing the risk of complications.”

The animal visitation program has proven successful across several military treatment facilities.

“Walter Reed, Twenty-nine Palms, Camp Lejeune, San Diego, and Portsmouth have all seen success with having dogs aboard the campuses,” said Rodriguez. “Most recently the Navy has had dogs aboard deployed vessels to help combat emotional stressors while underway. 2023 saw the successful implementation of the Navy’s Expanded Operational Stress Control Canine pilot program with dogs aboard the USS Ford and USS Wasp.”

Hospital Corpsman Jacob Rivera Calvo, a recent accession to U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command, beamed with a smile when he saw the dogs enter the facility.

“It has been at least two months since I’ve seen a dog,” said Rivera Calvo, who spent the last several months at Hospital Corps “A” School after graduating “Boot Camp” at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes.

“Watching those dogs walk into Patient Centered Medical Home made my entire day,” Rivera Calvo said. “I really enjoyed spending some time petting Apollo and having a few minutes to relax and just smile.”

Regularly scheduled visits will begin March 13, 2025, and feature a rotation of certified dogs on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10 a.m. - 2 p.m.

Despite these challenges, Zynex remains focused on diversifying its products and revenue streams, with the upcoming FDA submission for the NiCO pulse oximeter being a key strategic priority.","Zynex Inc ((ZYXI)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.

Zynex Inc’s recent earnings call presented a mixed sentiment, balancing between notable achievements and significant challenges. While the company celebrated growth in revenue per sales rep and promising trial outcomes for their NiCO pulse oximeter, it faced hurdles such as the Tricare payment suspension and a reported net loss for Q4. The absence of clear guidance for 2025 further contributed to the cautious tone of the call.

Revenue Growth and Diversification

Zynex Inc reported a 4% increase in revenue for 2024, with a notable 16% growth in orders. The company also achieved a 22% increase in revenue per sales representative, averaging $490,000. This growth underscores Zynex’s efforts to diversify and strengthen its revenue streams, despite facing challenges in other areas.

NiCO Pulse Oximeter Development

The development of the NiCO pulse oximeter is progressing well, with positive results from human trials conducted at Duke University and UCSF. Zynex is preparing for an FDA 510(k) submission, which could open doors to a multi-billion dollar market, marking a significant milestone in the company’s product innovation efforts.

Cost Savings

Zynex has implemented cost restructuring initiatives expected to save approximately $35 million annually. This includes a 15% reduction in corporate staff, reflecting the company’s strategic focus on optimizing operational efficiency and maintaining financial health.

Strong Cash Position

The company ended the year with a cash balance of $39.6 million, a 5% increase from Q3, and reported positive cash flows from operations for the year. This strong cash position provides Zynex with a solid foundation to navigate future challenges and invest in growth opportunities.

Tricare Payment Suspension

A significant challenge for Zynex is the temporary suspension of payments by Tricare, affecting 20-25% of its revenue. The resolution timeline remains uncertain, potentially taking up to 12 months, which poses a risk to the company’s financial stability.

Net Loss for Q4 2024

Zynex reported a net loss of $615,000 or $0.02 per share for Q4 2024, a stark contrast to the net income of $1.2 million in Q4 2023. The adjusted EBITDA also saw a significant decrease, highlighting the financial pressures faced by the company.

Decrease in Device Revenue

Device revenue decreased to $14.8 million from $16.3 million in Q4 2023, attributed to a shift in product mix towards lower-priced items. This decline emphasizes the need for Zynex to adapt its product strategy to sustain revenue growth.

Lack of 2025 Guidance

Due to the uncertainties surrounding the Tricare payment suspension, Zynex is unable to provide comprehensive guidance for 2025. This lack of clarity adds to the cautious outlook for the upcoming year.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Zynex’s guidance for the future is marked by both optimism and caution. The company projects $30 million in revenue for Q1 2025, with an anticipated net loss between $9 million and $10 million. Despite these challenges, Zynex remains focused on diversifying its products and revenue streams, with the upcoming FDA submission for the NiCO pulse oximeter being a key strategic priority.

In conclusion, Zynex Inc’s earnings call reflected a blend of optimism and caution. While the company has achieved significant milestones in revenue growth and product development, it faces substantial challenges, particularly with the Tricare payment suspension and financial losses. The lack of clear guidance for 2025 adds to the uncertainty, but Zynex’s strategic focus on diversification and cost savings provides a pathway for potential recovery and growth.

After the divorce was finalized my lawyer told me that she felt like there was something fishy that I should call Tricare to verify.

They told me that Tricare had initially paid for the appointment but then rescinded it because I was not eligible.","My ex-husband served four years and got out and was out several years before we married. He rejoined without telling me and suddenly I was thrust into an incredibly confusing life that I didn't really want. I knew nothing about the military or their procedures and he preferred to keep me in the dark.

While we were divorcing my ex-husband told myself and the courts that I got to retain my medical coverage. I honestly did not know any better. After the divorce was finalized my lawyer told me that she felt like there was something fishy that I should call Tricare to verify. I did and I was told that I still had Tricare. A few years later I had to call Tricare to get authorization for some medical thing and I asked them about my eligibility and was told yet again I was still eligible. I continued to use Tricare from 2012 to about 2019.

In 2019 we had another custody hearing and I was told that I was no longer eligible for Tricare. Whatever, I had other insurance at that point. Fast forward to today where I get a bill for my OBGYN for almost $500 from an appointment that I went to last year. They told me that Tricare had initially paid for the appointment but then rescinded it because I was not eligible. They accidentally billed Tricare even though I had let them know that I no longer had it and my other insurance was my only. The lady on the phone from the billing department told me that I needed to be careful that Tricare will take back any payments from the entire time they determined you were ineligible. Everything I've looked up now says that I was ineligible as soon as the divorce was finalized and he just never reported to DEERS that we were divorced. I looked all of this up years ago and was not able to find much information and like I said after I called they assured me I was still eligible so I just went with what they said.

This man was a manipulative abuser who made my life a living hell during our marriage and for 15 years after. I feel that he absolutely did this on purpose hoping that I would continue using Tricare and that eventually I would get bogged down with hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical bills. I have serious health conditions, I've seen so many doctors in the time I used Tricare, I've been to multiple specialists over the years. There would be no way to get out from under those bills. I have not heard a single thing else about any other insurance payments getting rescinded. I am wondering if this was just because they billed Tricare after I for sure didn't have it any longer? How likely is Tricare to investigate? I genuinely did not know, how much trouble could I be in? Could he get any trouble? Everything I've read today shows that the service member is the one that is supposed to report everything to DEERS.",,N,-1.0,2025-03-12 20:50:23.947912

Getting routine preventive care can help you stay well and catch problems early.

Be proactive and schedule your preventive health exams this year. With preventive health services, TRICARE has you covered.

So exactly what are preventive services, and what are their benefits?

“Taking care of your health isn’t just about reacting to issues—it’s about staying ahead of them,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for TRICARE Population Health and Disease Management, at the Defense Health Agency. “Preventive health services include recognized proactive health screenings, counseling, and maintenance to prevent future illness.”

Preventive health services play a key role in your long-term physical and mental health. Read on to learn more about the benefits of preventive health services and how TRICARE covers these services.

Benefits of preventive health services

Preventive health checkups can help avoid health problems before they start. Checkups also help in detecting conditions for which you may be at risk.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, preventive health services can help find and diagnose illnesses or diseases by tracking blood pressure, cholesterol, and getting diabetes screenings. This means treatment can start early and is most likely to be effective. Regular preventive checkups have been shown to reduce the risk for serious illness or diseases, like cancer.

Types of preventive health services

When to start health screenings—and how often you have them—will vary. For instance, your gender, age, family history, and other risk factors. For each screening, TRICARE offers guidelines to help you plan. You can also ask your primary health care provider if you’re due for any screenings.

TRICARE covers many types of preventive exams and screenings. Many of them are conducted in a Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exam.

Adults

As you age, it’s important to know when to start preventive care.

Blood pressure screenings

Cancer screenings

Cholesterol testing

Hepatitis B

Immunizations

Physicals

Men should get regular prostate cancer exams. Women should get well-woman exams (includes breast exams, pelvic exams, and Pap tests) and mammograms.

There are special screenings such as a colonoscopy, to determine the health of the colon. CDC guidelines advise a colonoscopy once every 10 years beginning at age 45 for individuals at average risk for colon cancer.

Some types of non-routine diagnostic tests are for patients with signs or symptoms or are at high risk of developing a condition. They may require a referral or pre-authorization from your provider.

Children

Preventive services are key for kids to stay healthy. And, getting your kids in the routine of getting regular checkups is a great habit they’ll take into adulthood. These preventive services include:

Well-child exams (includes developmental and behavioral assessments)

Immunizations

Vision screenings

Preventive care costs

TRICARE makes it easy to get the preventive care you and your family need.

If you see a TRICARE network provider, TRICARE covers all clinical preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. TRICARE Prime covers one HP&DP exam annually.

If you have TRICARE For Life, you may have a TRICARE cost-share for any preventive service that Medicare or TRICARE doesn’t cover. Visit Medicare’s preventive coverage and screenings page for more information.

Remember, even if you feel well, it’s important to see a doctor regularly to:

“Ideal solutions should be effective for workloads operating across multiple AWS [Amazon Web Services] GovCloud accounts; however, preference will be given to solutions which are agnostic of cloud service providers,” the request for information states.

The RFI also states that industry solutions “at a minimum” should be capable of managing, sustaining and deploying distributions of Kubernetes — the open-source container arrangement platform that automates the deployment and management of containerized software, otherwise known as packages of software that contain all the files needed to run an application independently of other software components in any environment, according to Amazon Web Services.

Further, solutions should be compatible with Platform One’s Big Bang, the DoD’s “trusted” open source DevSecOps platform which can cut the time it takes the department to approve software from years to 90 days utilizing authority to operate, or ATO, procedures, according to Platform One’s website.

“Product vendors should anticipate the need to include integration services within this effort either internally or in partnership with a systems integrator. System integrators without a vendor partnership will be considered if leveraging commercial and/or open-source tools in accordance with all applicable licenses,” the RFI reads.

The system, which provides health care for 9.6 million beneficiaries, including roughly 1.3 million active-duty service members, is struggling with what is known as the ""peacetime effect"" -- making sure that physicians, nurses, medics and corpsmen have needed military training and experience needed to care for troops during conflicts.

It also is dealing with systemic changes initiated in 2017 that have not been fully realized, leaving hospitals short-staffed and patients seeking care elsewhere, witnesses said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on military medical combat readiness.

The Defense Department began reorganizing the military health system nearly a decade ago with a plan to focus the service medical commands on troops and training medical forces for garrison and wartime operations, with the Defense Health Agency managing support services, facilities and health care for family members and other beneficiaries.

Staffing miscalculations, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic and a budget that has not kept up with medical inflation, has left the system unprepared for trauma medicine, retired military trauma surgeons and the first director of the Defense Health Agency said.

Retired Air Force Reserve Col. Jeremy Cannon, who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and currently manages a trauma training partnership between Penn Medicine and the U.S. Navy, said just 10% of military surgeons currently are combat ready -- a result of not having enough patients or a variety of cases.

""If we maintain the status quo and enter a pure conflict unprepared, we will condemn thousands of warfighters to preventable death. Without urgent intervention, the [military health system] will continue to slide into medical obsolescence,"" Cannon said.

In 10 years, the budget for military health facilities has declined by nearly 12%, according to committee chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., while medical inflation has risen an average of 5.1% per year.

A concerted effort to rein in health costs in the last decade has greatly affected military physicians' ability to provide care and maintain their skills, said retired Air Force Major Gen. Paul Friedrichs, who served as the Joint Staff Surgeon from 2019 to 2023.

""Health care is not cheap. The mistaken belief that somehow military medicine can be done at a lower cost than in the civilian sector and be ready for conflict is just that,"" Friedrichs said.

In late 2023, then-Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks issued a memo calling for the system to bring patients back into military treatment facilities -- family members and retirees who left either by their own choice because they faced challenges getting care at military hospitals and clinics or were forced out with the increased emphasis on active-duty personnel.

The former officers said that, although those patients usually don't present opportunities for practicing trauma skills, care for acute and chronic conditions helps military medicine maintain proficiency.

For example, Friedrichs said, similar skills are needed to reconstruct or remove a bladder that has been damaged by a gunshot wound as are used to operate on a patient with bladder cancer.

""We need our military medics taking care of sick patients. That is how we have done it historically to maintain the proficiency of surgeons or critical care nurses or the medical logistics staff. ... It's not a perfect analog, but it is the best surrogate,"" Friedrichs said.

In addition to bringing back patients and keeping hospitals staffed, the military health system should ramp up efforts to become premier trauma centers in their communities, they added.

Cannon said the system should establish ""five to six"" high-volume military facilities that serve as centers for trauma and burn care and are part of the national emergency preparedness system, open to military and civilian emergencies.

Currently, Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, is the DoD's only highest-level trauma center, although other hospitals, including Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, have received lower-level trauma designations.

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Doug Robb, who served as the first head of the Defense Health Agency, and Friedrichs also added that the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs should increase the level of their partnerships, working together to treat patients in co-located or integrated facilities.

""What I think is really important is that we have to create a capability,"" Robb said.

Friedrichs, who commanded the joint venture DoD-VA hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, said success has been achieved in similar partnerships in Pensacola, Florida, and at Travis Air Force Base in California.

""We want access to critical care patients for our proficiency, and the VA wants access to resources, which is either excess capacity on space or in staff, and so I think that's continued movement forward,"" he said.

The three urged lawmakers not to shutter any pipelines for medical personnel training, given the shortage of providers in the military and civilian sectors, and they pressed for the creation of a Joint Trauma System responsible for spearheading combat casualty care.

Currently, according to Cannon, no single command heads up this important mission.

""In 2017, the Joint Trauma System, or JTS, was codified in law. This committee must now strengthen the statutory language to affirm that JTS owns combat casualty care and to provide this precious resource with both top-down authority and bottom-up support,"" Cannon said.

The recommendations come as the Trump administration has launched an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce. An estimated 5,400 Defense Department employees were expected to lose their jobs in the first round of cuts, including some from the Defense Health Agency.

Wicker and the committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said they would consider crafting legislation to help improve readiness, and they urged the Defense Department to continue pursuing reforms.

""We must stop scapegoating the Defense Health Agency. The DoD must request adequate resources to ensure that the department's hospitals and clinics are properly staffed and equipped. This is the best way to ensure that the military health system is ready for the potential demands of large-scale combat operations in the future,"" Wicker said.

Reed added that the system must be fixed to ensure that U.S. forces aren't caught without access to care, especially in remote locations where medical responders might not have access to logistics and support.

""The Department of Defense made progress to break through [its] inertia in 2023 when it issued a memorandum with specific directions to stabilize and improve the military health system. ... More work remains to be done, and I hope that the Trump administration will continue the momentum in this area,"" Reed said.

BETHESDA, Md. — Senior Department of Defense (DoD) officials engaged directly with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center staff during a Senior Leaders Forum on March 7, addressing concerns ranging from military medical readiness to workforce reductions and efficiency improvements.

Darin Selnick, Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, fielded questions and reinforced Walter Reed's critical role in military healthcare.

Mr. Selnick said it’s important for leaders to conduct site visits and listen to feedback from staff. “Health care equals military readiness,” he said.

Walter Reed’s leadership, including Director U.S. Navy Capt. Melissa C. Austin, underscored the institution’s role as the military health system's premier medical center.

“Rebuilding that sense of ‘We are the President’s Hospital, the flagship of the Military Health System, and where we lead, everyone else follows’ takes time,” Austin said.

She emphasized that while facility challenges exist, Walter Reed also tackles broader concerns to enhance patient care and workplace morale. “Given the appropriate latitude at my level to perform—top-down and bottom-up—we have the opportunity to make this a much more efficient place that will make staff excited to come to work,” she said.

U.S. Navy Capt. Juan Rosario, Walter Reed’s chief of staff, provided a personal testament to the hospital’s lifesaving care.

“In 2018, my family came here after we were stationed in Italy. My daughter was diagnosed with cancer,” Rosario shared. “The Walter Reed we’re excited to get behind now saved her life.”

He pushed back against the notion that private-sector healthcare is always superior. “The family we have here at Walter Reed and the care that you receive here [show] our commitment,” he said. “We are committed to making sure that the same care my daughter received is the care that every soldier, every Marine, every sailor, and every airman receives every day.”

Ferrara, a former Walter Reed clinician and interventional radiologist, reinforced the need for cohesive medical teams to maintain operational effectiveness.

“The health care [system] is an ecosystem, and all things work as a unit,” Ferrara explained. “For a surgeon to wield the scalpel, you need a logistician to buy the scalpel, the patient admin person to check that patient in and generate a wristband. You need a biomed tech to make sure that the instruments are sterile. You need environmental services making sure that the hospital is clean and that infection control measures are met.”

Selnick stressed that patient confidence determines an institution’s success.

“Patients will vote with their feet,” he said. “If you are quality, people will come from long distances and wait [to receive your care]. People will flee if there are long wait times and poor care. It’s the whole environment [of care].”

Ferrara emphasized that high-quality healthcare supports military readiness—ensuring service members can focus on their missions without concerns about their families’ well-being.

“As we go forward, we want to make sure you have the resources to do what you need to do,” Selnick assured Walter Reed staff.

The town hall forum reaffirmed Walter Reed’s commitment to delivering world-class care while navigating institutional challenges, maintaining mission readiness, and upholding its legacy as the President’s Hospital since 1942.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8910784/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-12 14:50:31.915688

“DHA is paying Express Scripts billions of taxpayer dollars to manage the TRICARE benefit and negotiate with itself – and DHA isn’t even bothering to check the books.”

Video of Exchange (YouTube)

Washington, D.C. – At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked Lieutenant General Dr. Douglas J. Robb of the U.S. Air Force about price gouging in the military’s prescription drug system.

Senator Warren slammed the Defense Health Agency for failing to rein in Cigna-owned Express Scripts, the nation’s second largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) that manages the prescription drug system for nearly 10 million servicemembers, military retirees, and their family members. Since 2009, the giant PBM has leveraged its $4.3 billion contract to steer patients away from local pharmacies and towards Accredo, a giant pharmacy business that Express Scripts also owns. Now, recent investigations and whistleblower complaints reveal that Express Scripts is failing to report tens of thousands of expensive, specialty drug prescriptions funneled to Accredo, potentially overcharging taxpayers by billions of dollars – just as the company has done in other taxpayer-funded government programs.

Senator Warren called for the Defense Health Agency to audit Express Scripts and for a requirement of that audit to be included in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.

Lieutenant General Robb agreed that this taxpayer overcharging is “unfair” and said that Express Scripts needs to “follow what is the business policy and what is the contractual law.”

Major General Dr. Paul A. Friedrichs of the U.S. Air Force pointed to the Veterans Health Administration’s prescription drug system, which uses an in-house PBM, as an example of “how to deliver better care and, where possible, do it more efficiently,” and called for collaboration between the agency and Congress to emulate that system for servicemembers and their families in TRICARE.

Transcript: Hearing to Receive Testimony on Stabilizing the Military Health System to Prepare for Large-Scale Combat Operations

Senate Armed Services Committee

March 11, 2025

Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, we need a medical healthcare system that works in wartime – but the one we have is failing us in peacetime. And I think we need to do better on this. Fixing TRICARE’s prescription drug benefit is part of that.

Since 2009, TRICARE has outsourced to Express Scripts, a massive pharmacy benefit manager, PBM. The Defense Health Agency, DHA, pays Express Scripts to negotiate with pharmacies, deciding where servicemembers can pick up their prescriptions and what price they’re going to pay.

But Express Scripts also owns Accredo, a massive pharmacy that participates in TRICARE. And DHA has been allowing all kinds of self-dealing between these two entities.

Here’s one: DHA used to require Express Scripts to maintain a network of 50,000 pharmacies. But in 2021, Express Scripts negotiated that down to 35,000. Then it turned around and told thousands of pharmacies that they don’t own to either take money-losing terms or get kicked out of TRICARE.

General Robb, you used to oversee the TRICARE network before this gaming started, but do you have any idea how many pharmacies have left just since 2022?

Lieutenant General Dr. Douglas J. Robb, U.S. Air Force: Senator Warren, I have been out of that business since 2016. So –

Senator Warren: Okay, I just wondered if you’d happened to know how many had left. I’ll take a no.

Lieutenant General Robb: No, ma’am. I do not.

Senator Warren: Well, it’s over 13,000 pharmacies left this network, and most of them are independent pharmacies, community pharmacies. That has forced 400,000 servicemembers and their families to find new pharmacies, and many of them have been pushed to the Express Scripts-owned Accredo.

Even worse, Express Scripts has set up Accredo as the primary off-base pharmacy where military families can fill specialty drug prescriptions – you know, these are the really expensive cancer drugs, rheumatoid arthritis drugs that make up over half of the $8 billion in TRICARE prescription drug spend. So it’s a lot of money here.

And it doesn’t end there. As we speak, Express Scripts is facing a whistleblower lawsuit that alleges the company systematically overfilled TRICARE prescriptions at Accredo, saddling DoD with, “billions-of-dollars in excess dispensing fees and drug resupplies.” And this isn’t a surprise. Express Scripts has been found to massively overfill and overpay for prescriptions at Accredo, which they own, in other government programs.

General Robb, since last year, an audit uncovered that Express Scripts was leveraging its contract with the West Virginia Public Employees system to send inflated payments to Accredo for expensive specialty drugs, in some cases inflating the price by 100-fold more than the cost of dispensing the exact same drugs at a competing pharmacy. I imagine you think this type of taxpayer overcharging is unacceptable, is that fair, General Robb?

Lieutenant General Robb: I would agree with that it would be unfair, yes ma'am.

Senator Warren: DHA is supposed to audit Express Scripts's pharmacy data to make sure the same thing isn’t happening at TRICARE. But DHA said it hadn’t completed an audit because DHA had ""no concerns about data accuracy."" Talk about being asleep at the wheel here.

In just the first quarter of 2023, Express Scripts dispensed 70,000 specialty drug perceptions at Accredo, but the company only reported about 40,000 to DHA. In other words, Accredo failed to report nearly half of the expensive specialty drugs dispensed at its own pharmacy, which were paid for by DHA. They get the money but they don't tell DHA what is going on here.

General Robb, after completing their investigation, GAO sensibly recommended that DHA periodically audit Express Scripts' reported data for accuracy which, by the way, is already required in the contract. So this is telling them basically to follow through on the contract. Do you agree with GAO's recommendation?

Lieutenant General Robb: I would agree that they need to follow what is the business policy and what is the contractual law.

Senator Warren: You know, I just want to say, and I’ll close up here. DHA is paying Express Scripts billions of taxpayer dollars to manage the TRICARE benefit and negotiate with itself. And DHA isn’t even bothering to check the books. I think everyone in the room agrees that Express Scripts ought to pass an audit and that ought to be required in this year's NDAA.

Chair Wicker: Thank you, Senator Warren.

Major General Dr. Paul A. Friedrichs, U.S. Air Force (Ret.): Mr. Chairman, may I add a comment to that? Is there time?

Chair Wicker: You certainly may, yes.

Major General Friedrichs: Thank you very much. I would hold up the Veterans Health Administration's exemplary mail-order program, which has worked for years, as an opportunity – again, going back to the concept of how to deliver better care and, where possible, do it more efficiently. There's a real opportunity for this committee, in partnership with the appropriate VA oversight committees, to direct a comparison of the two systems and then bring back recommendations for the best practices between the two.

Pharmaceuticals are growing in cost, and that is not going to change. But this is an area in which the Veterans Health Administration actually has done this well for years with high patient satisfaction and, more importantly, the patients get the meds they need when they need them. There's a real opportunity to learn from the VA here.

Chair Wicker: Thank you very much.

Randolph, VT, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA) and SMU are collaborating to develop microrobots for vitreous hemorrhage mitigation and accelerated recovery.

The project will be led by ARA Senior Research Scientist Louis William Rogowski, PhD, and supported by Min Jun Kim, PhD, of the Robert C. Womack Endowed Chair Professor at SMU's Lyle School of Engineering.

Bleeding inside the eye from vitreous hemorrhage injuries can lead to months of vision impairment and discomfort, reducing the combat readiness of U.S. armed forces. Researchers will build small-scale microrobots using nanotechnology that can go inside the human eye and break down red blood cells through targeted drug delivery.

""The idea is that this microrobotics approach would be less invasive than current treatment methods and accelerate the recovery of patients,” Rogowski said. ""This is the first initial effort to make this idea a reality.”

ARA's Randolph, VT location will host the laboratory facilities needed to carry out the experiments in conjunction with SMU's facilities in Dallas, TX. By the end of the effort, the team will produce innovative microrobots, advanced control systems, and quantitative data showing the effectiveness of the treatment strategy.

Several SMU graduate students will participate in the research in support of their studies and consultants from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus will also lend their expertise to ensure the effort's success.

ARA and its partners are leveraging microrobotics for numerous applications including targeted drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery, environmental remediation, encryption, and defense applications. ARA is proud to partner with medical, academic, and military communities to develop leading-edge health solutions.

The project is sponsored by the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) and the Defense Health Agency. This effort is fully sponsored by the Government under Other Transaction Number HT9425-25-9-0004.

Benefits of preventive health services Preventive health checkups can help avoid health problems before they start.
Types of preventive health services When to start health screenings—and how often you have them—will vary.","MARCH 12, 2025 – Your health is about more than just sick visits and medications—it’s also about making choices that keep you feeling your best. Getting routine preventive care can help you stay well and catch problems early.

Be proactive and schedule your preventive health exams this year. With preventive health services, TRICARE has you covered.

So exactly what are preventive services, and what are their benefits?

“Taking care of your health isn’t just about reacting to issues—it’s about staying ahead of them,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for TRICARE Population Health and Disease Management, at the Defense Health Agency. “Preventive health services include recognized proactive health screenings, counseling, and maintenance to prevent future illness.”

Preventive health services play a key role in your long-term physical and mental health. Read on to learn more about the benefits of preventive health services and how TRICARE covers these services.

Benefits of preventive health services

Preventive health checkups can help avoid health problems before they start. Checkups also help in detecting conditions for which you may be at risk.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, preventive health services can help find and diagnose illnesses or diseases by tracking blood pressure, cholesterol, and getting diabetes screenings. This means treatment can start early and is most likely to be effective. Regular preventive checkups have been shown to reduce the risk for serious illness or diseases, like cancer.

Types of preventive health services

When to start health screenings—and how often you have them—will vary. For instance, your gender, age, family history, and other risk factors. For each screening, TRICARE offers guidelines to help you plan. You can also ask your primary health care provider if you’re due for any screenings.

TRICARE covers many types of preventive exams and screenings. Many of them are conducted in a Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exam.

Adults

As you age, it’s important to know when to start preventive care:

Blood pressure screenings

Cancer screenings

Cholesterol testing

Hepatitis B

Immunizations

Physicals

Men should get regular prostate cancer exams. Women should get well-woman exams (includes breast exams, pelvic exams, and Pap tests) and mammograms.

There are special screenings such as a colonoscopy, to determine the health of the colon. CDC guidelines advise a colonoscopy once every 10 years beginning at age 45 for individuals at average risk for colon cancer.

Some types of non-routine diagnostic tests are for patients with signs or symptoms or are at high risk of developing a condition. They may require a referral or pre-authorization from your provider.

Children

Preventive services are key for kids to stay healthy. And, getting your kids in the routine of getting regular checkups is a great habit they’ll take into adulthood. These preventive services include:

Well-child exams (includes developmental and behavioral assessments)

Immunizations

Vision screenings

Preventive care costs

TRICARE makes it easy to get the preventive care you and your family need.

If you see a TRICARE network provider, TRICARE covers all clinical preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. TRICARE Prime covers one HP&DP exam annually.

If you have TRICARE For Life, you may have a TRICARE cost-share for any preventive service that Medicare or TRICARE doesn’t cover. Visit Medicare’s preventive coverage and screenings page for more information.

Remember, even if you feel well, it’s important to see a doctor regularly to:

Maintain good health

Help avoid problems in the future

Detect a condition before it worsens

I delayed enrolling in Part B for 5 years after I turned 70 and retired with a January 1 effective date for my Medicare Supplement Plan G and Part D prescription drug plan.

Now my Medicare stress has started, because I have received a notice from CMS saying they do not have record of me having prescription drug coverage that “met Medicare’s minimum standards” from March 1, 2019, when I turned 65 to January 1, 2025, when I retired, and I may receive a Part D late enrollment penalty.

I thought applying for Part B with that form from my employer attached kept me from a Part D penalty. Can you please advise me what to do? I want to be sure that I do not make a mistake. Thank you, Toni.– Zach, Lake Jackson, TX.

Hi Zach: Many Americans who retire after 65, leaving employer group health plans, apply for Medicare benefits and discover that they now may need to prove they had “creditable drug coverage” for a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

Zach, enrolling in Medicare Part B properly does not prove that your employer’s group prescription drug plan was creditable. The Medicare & You handbook states:

“Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. Your plan must tell you each year if your non-Medicare drug coverage is creditable coverage.” … Keep records showing when you had other creditable prescription drug coverage and tell your plan when they ask about it. If you don’t tell your plan about your previous creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage.

The paragraphs above do not advise what creditable coverage is. To explore for more details on “creditable prescription drug coverage” visit www.medicare.gov or email info@tonisays.com with your Medicare questions.

Creditable drug coverage should “meet or exceed” Medicare’s Part D plan minimum. The minimum deductible for 2025, as an example, should at least be $590 or less (this amount changes every year) with a maximum out-of-pocket. The benefit amount should be unlimited, so if your plan has a coverage limit or cap, it is not creditable. Unlimited prescription drug coverage is the key.

Medicare does not regard discount prescription drug programs from Walmart, Kroger, GoodRx, Amazon pharmacy or your local pharmacy that offer low-cost generics as “creditable coverage.” If you believe these plans can keep you from the Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP), I need to tell you that you’re WRONG!! According to CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), these types of prescription drug programs are not creditable.

For Veterans using the VA for prescriptions, I have good news for you – Medicare does consider the VA pharmacy to be creditable coverage.

Medicare can impose the Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) because:

-Your company prescription drug benefits are not considered creditable as Medicare declares.

-You fail to call and confirm that your company prescription drug benefits were creditable, if requested via correspondence from your Part D plan.

-You had no creditable coverage and never enrolled in Medicare Part D when you were first eligible.

If you wait longer than 63 days without creditable prescription drug coverage when leaving company benefits and are older than 65 years and 90 days old, you may be assessed a LEP which is 1 percent for each month back to the month your Part A began, not from when your Part B begins. (Chapter 5 of my Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).

Zach, you need to find the record from your previous (employer) plan showing that your prescription drug coverage was “creditable” and submit it when your new Part D plan.",https://www.canyon-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Toni-King.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-12 13:50:32.477547

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zynex fourth-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Prenoveau, Investor Relations for Zynex.

Brian Prenoveau

Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, Zynex released financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. A copy of the press release is available on the company's website.

Joining me today on the call are Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer; Anna Lucsok, Chief Operating Officer; and Donald Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring Solutions.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward-looking statements regarding future events. We encourage you to review the company's past and future filings with the SEC including, without limitation, the company's 2024 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, which identify the specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements.

These factors may include, without limitation, statements regarding product development, product potential, the regulatory environment, sales and marketing strategies, capital resources or operating performance.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard

Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings call. 2024 was a successful year for Zynex as we continue to grow revenue and drive profitability.

We have made strides in diversifying our revenue streams with the addition of several new products, some internally developed and some manufactured and added private label products, primarily in the areas of pricing, cold and compression products, all a perfect fit for our sales force's call points in pain and rehab.

We've also expanded the focus of our sales force to additional new prescribers of pain and rehab products such as national change of workers' comp and the VA. In a moment, Don Gregg will provide you with an update for our patient monitoring business and the FDA submission of our pulse oximeter.

In late 2024, we received positive test results on our NiCO pulse oximiter in multiple trials done at Duke University and at the University of California and San Francisco. Human trial completion is an essential step prior to our 510(k) submission to the FDA.

The data from the trials have been excellent in showing how much lower buyers the current LED-based compared to how the current LED-based oximeters exhibit, especially for skin with darker pigmentation. The old LED technology leads to inaccurate or inconsistent readings during clinical -- or critical times for a patient, which has been widely criticized in the media and politically.

We believe that our laser-based system is a superior technology and has the opportunity to meaningfully impact patient outcomes. I would like Don Gregg to provide more details on the status momentarily.

We were recently notified by TRICARE that they were temporarily suspending payments to Zynex related to a review of prior claims. We have a meeting with them here in early April to get it all sorted out, but cannot at this point, provide an estimate on when it will all be resolved. Anna will provide more details during her discussion of operations.

Given that TRICARE is a substantial source of reimbursement revenue, we currently have limited visibility in our revenue projections for 2025. And we have taken the most conservative approach to not include revenue in the later part of 2024, where some of those builds were submitted to TRICARE yet not paid. And in this current quarter forecast and therefore the corresponding lower revenue numbers.

As part of a normal prudent cost containment measure due to the possibility of a significant decrease in revenue short term, while we accelerate sales to other sales channels, we continue to make adjustments to the corporate and sales cost structure to ensure we have optimized our structure and expense profile and are set to continue our long-term growth and profitability. And again, Anna will cover this in more detail.

We remain very optimistic about the future of Zynex, the improvement we have made in analytics and operations over the past many years, we show significant benefits in the long term. As we continue to diversify the product mix and revenue stream, we believe we can actually better capture the $800 million of identified sales opportunities within our 800 designated sales territories. In the patient monitoring business, we had just before FDA submission and once cleared, that should generate revenue in a very well-established multibillion-dollar sales segment.

Over the past 29 years since inception, our growth has certainly not been in a straight line as long-term shareholders would certainly acknowledge. And the key for us is to keep focused on the long vision of growth and diversification and stay firm regardless of short-term disruptions. We trust that shareholders are on board with this strategy.

Our recent challenges in 2024 were not only introducing new products that so far have collected less than expected. However, we see clear signs of improvement here in early 2025. Our sales force and staff has been restructured and we have made changes to sales management.

These improvements are already beginning to take effect and puts us in a good position to deal with the temporary suspension -- payment suspension from TRICARE, while we focus on growing in other areas. Fortunately, we are in an industry where our potential call points for our sales force is nearly endless.

We are still confident that our noninvasive approach with at-home pain management devices have real growth opportunities to provide non-opioid relief to patients. We remain focused on ramping our hospital monitoring division, which represents a large and growing market opportunity with a better mass trap than our competitors in the pulse oximeter market.

I'll now turn the call over to Anna Lucsok to provide a more detailed update on the operations and the status with TRICARE. Anna?

Anna Lucsok

Thank you, Thomas. As Thomas mentioned, we were notified by TRICARE of a temporary suspension of payments if they complete their review. From a reimbursement perspective, TRICARE is one of our largest insurers. We're currently working through the reinstatement process and have a meeting with Defense Health Agency to present our appeal in early April, but worst case, it could take as long as 12 months to complete.

TRICARE represents between 20% to 25% of our revenue. So this is a significant reduction in revenue if the suspension were to be upheld. I think it is important to note a few things relative to this news. We completed an audit with TRICARE as recently as 2022.

In this audit, we made all of the necessary adjustments to billing practices that were outlined and we haven't heard anything further since that time. We have demonstrated that we fully comply with those adjustments and have a good cost for eventually continued business as usual with TRICARE.

During this temporary suspension, we remain in network with TRICARE and are expected to continue processing new and existing claims for treatment for TRICARE patients. In fact, TRICARE has said that they [ will incur ] and new patients to continue receiving care through this process per hour contract. If or when the reimbursement begin again, TRICARE would be responsible for paying all of the claims that have been processed during the temporary hold, which would show significantly increased revenue once received.

Moving on to operations. We're also restructuring our organization and staff levels, which will decrease overall staff by 15% and primarily affects employees in our corporate office along with other expense reductions made during the second half of 2024 and Q1 2025, will result in annual savings of approximately $35 million. This is a normal and good business practice that all companies constantly undergo.

In 2024, trimmed the sales force to ensure we have the right reps in place to put us in the best position moving forward. As of December 31, we had a sales force of approximately 330 people as compared to the beginning of 2024, where we had approximately 475 people.

Progress takes time, but we have seen positive trends. Revenue increased 4% in 2024 and order growth was 16% in the year. The total number of reps was down with the revenue per rep increased 22% to 490,000 on average in 2024.

I'll now turn the call over to Don Gregg to provide a more detailed update on the patient monitoring business. Don?

Donald Gregg

Thank you, Anna. I want to provide an update on the progress of our NiCO pulse oximeter. Although our FDA submission has been delayed into 2025, we are closing on major milestones to commercialize the NiCO pulse oximeter. NiCO verification human trials completed in fourth quarter of 2024 at Duke University, with positive results as planned.

Zynex's NiCO pulse oximeter utilizes precise laser technology to measure blood oxygenation levels directly as opposed to current LED pulse oximeter products, which only estimate oxygenation levels. LED pulse oximeters have been shown to mismeasure oxygen levels in several populations most prominently in individuals with darker skin pigmentation.

We presented a poster of our study from the University of California, San Francisco Hypoxia lab at Anesthesiology 2024 in the fourth quarter. Four NiCO pulse oximeters and two different commercially available LED-based pulse oximeters were used on each participant.

Conclusions from the study showed the NiCO pulse oximeter did not demonstrate a bias for dark pigmented participants compared to lightly segmented participants. By comparison, conventional LED-based pulse oximeters in the present study read falsely higher on darkly pigmented participants, specifically at lower oxygen saturation levels.

There have been published studies starting in the 1980s that detail how these inaccuracies were associated with disparities in care. Completed human trials were one of the last major milestones to complete prior to the FDA 510(k) submission. In late 2024 and into 2025, NiCOs have been undergoing third-party regulatory ISO testing for compliance to safety and electrical standards.

At this point, we anticipate FDA submission in the next 30 to 60 days following that completion based on historical submissions, approval takes approximately 6 months, which would mean a potential fourth quarter 2025 clearance barring any uncertainty of FDA review resources.

Also, in December of 2024, we announced our membership in the open oximetry project, a nonprofit oximetry partnership of research organizations and industry is created to improve the safety and precision of pulse oximeters in all populations.

Zynex is pushing to be a key industry partner to all clinicians and show how the NiCO pulse oximeter technology inherently solves the current market challenges, especially skin pigmentation bias while bringing new precision medicine forward in the field of pulse oximetry.

In summary, we've achieved major milestones in Q4 of 2024, and on NiCO commercial development, clinical verification, and we are very close to FDA 510(k) submission. Patient monitoring is a multibillion-dollar market that we believe we can enter with a superior product that can meaningfully improve care to a broad range of patients when they need it most.

I will now turn the call over to Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, for a more in-depth look at the quarter's financial performance.

Daniel Moorhead

Thanks, Don. Please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024.

Net revenue was $46 million compared to $47.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Device revenue was $14.8 million compared to $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Supplies revenue was $31.2 million, up from $31 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Device revenue was lower during the quarter due to some product mix shift to lower-priced products such as braces and other products that have lower price points than NexWave devices.

Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $36 million or 78% of revenue as compared to $37 million, also 78% of revenue in 2023. Sales and marketing expenses were $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $21.7 million in the same period in 2023. The primary contributor to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was our headcount reduction of roughly 140 sales team members.

G&A expenses were $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of compared to $13 million last year, largely due to ZMS increased expenses and professional fees. Net loss was $615,000 or $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.04 per share in Q4 of '23.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2024, was $584,000 as compared to $9.9 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $2.4 million in Q4 and $12.7 million for the full year. The cash flow in the quarter and year increased our cash on the balance sheet to $39.6 million up 5% from Q3's balance of $37.6 million. Working capital was $58.3 million as of December 31.

With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard

Yeah. Thank you, Dan. The beginning of 2025 was certainly not as smooth as we had hoped, but we are optimistic about the long-term prospects of the company and the opportunities we have going forward. That still has not changed. Because of the uncertainties surrounding payments here short term for TRICARE, we will not be providing full 2025 annual guidance yet, given the lack of visibility surrounding the temporary payment suspension.

We are obviously still in network with TRICARE and continue to accept new prescriptions for the instructions. When we learn more information throughout the year, we'll be better able to communicate expectations and update everyone.

At this stage, we anticipate the first quarter this year revenue of approximately $30 million. We will likely have a net loss in the first quarter ranging between $9 million and $10 million as a result of not all restructuring having taken effect yet. Throughout this year, we will look to make adjustments to the cost structures as needed.

Fundamentally, with or without TRICARE as payer, we still have a rock solid business that will continue to grow towards revenues of $800 million-plus in the pain management division. Our diversification into the patient monitoring area is set to start adding revenue late this year and next year, pending FDA clearance.

We're incredibly proud of the growth that we have consistently demonstrated over the past several years. Just 10 years ago, our revenues were nearly 20 times lower than now. And in the meantime, we've been able to buy back over $80 million worth of stock in the open market. And we had a cash balance of $40 million at the end of 2024. Well, 10 years ago, we were scraping the bottom while bank account daily to pay our bills.

Looking forward, we believe we have additional customers and revenue streams that can drive further growth. The business we have created and the profitability we are able to generate allows us to have a high degree of flexibility to allocate capital in several ways and deal with temporary difficult situations like this. We have shown the ability to adjust to market customer and reimbursement changes and continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders.

With that, operator, please open the call up for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Jeffrey Cohen, Ladenburg.

Jeffrey Cohen

Well, hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple from our end. So when you talk about the stock reductions of 15%-ish. Could you give us a sense of what was accomplished in the fourth quarter? And then also give us a sense of how that will affect your two OpEx lines, both the sales line and the G&A line?

Daniel Moorhead

Yeah. I would say the -- we probably did -- if you're looking at $30 million-plus in annual savings, I would say a little less than half of it was done during 2024. But you wouldn't see all of it because, obviously, you're looking at run rates and those types of things. So they were -- a lot of those were implemented in the second half. And then the remaining pieces were done in Q1 with some of that coming late in Q1.

So as -- if you're looking at sales expenses and those types of things, as far as run rate Q4 sales, we just posted $19.3 million. I think that number is definitely coming down, and that has been coming down for the past few quarters, as you know.

So it's probably down million to $2 million on the run rate going forward. And then G&A, you're going to see about the same thing down a couple of million dollars a quarter based on what we did in Q4. And those will actually continue to come down in Q2 a little bit as well. Like I said, a lot of those changes were put in at the end or middle to end of Q1.

Jeffrey Cohen

Yeah. So I guess the 30% on an annual basis for 2025, does it hit both the sales and marketing as well as the G&A, the same percentage? Or is it going to be more heavily weighted on the sales and marketing line?

Daniel Moorhead

No, it'd be more on the G&A because the G&A is a smaller number, too. So it's going to be a bigger number out of these smaller numbers. Sales was already decreasing based on the trimming that Anna talked about and those types of things. So I think as a percentage, it's going to be more on the G&A line, but both are going to be decreasing by like I said, run rate, you're looking at close to $2 million compared to what we did in Q4.

Jeffrey Cohen

Got it. Okay. Secondly, maybe for Thomas or for Don. Could you hypothesize with us a little bit about [NiCOx] and the commercial path to market that you're anticipating? Are you hypothesizing going direct yourselves with a commercial organization or your hypothesizing partners or different setups for different channels?

Donald Gregg

So this is Don. We have a strategy that actually leverages all three of those. As you look at penetrating the market as we would get clearance in potentially in 2026 certainly would be the year of ramp for that. We have been in discussions with potential partners, not just distribution partners but partners that would potentially take the device and put it in their sales bag. We have had discussions through what it would look like as part of a direct sales force, where we would start with particular hospitals and IDNs.

And then third of all, we have looked at an indirect sales force of potential 1099s of organizations that sell both capital and disposable equipment in this. And so we're poised to be ready to pull the trigger when we have clearance and covered the entire plan with Thomas and our executive leaders.

Jeffrey Cohen

Okay, perfect. That does it for us. Thanks for taking our questions.

Operator

Shagun Singh, RBC.

Avi Dahan

Hey. Good afternoon. This is Avi on for Shagun. I have a few questions. First, what was the nature of the 2022 audit by TRICARE related to billing practices? And I guess, why didn't you have any visibility to TRICARE ahead of time before this happened?

Anna Lucsok

So the nature of the audit was a routine post-payment audit. It's very common from most insurance companies and the type of adjustments that were suggested during the audit were also fairly standard. So nothing major was identified or adjusted.

Avi Dahan

Okay. Could you -- Okay. I guess that's helpful. Why don't you have -- you only gave Q1 sales guidance not 2025, obviously, but why don't you have the visibility into sales? You have still 75% of your business or so that is being reimbursed? Could there be a domino effect? What conversations are you having with other payers?

Thomas Sandgaard

No, there's really no connection here. This is totally isolated. We do, obviously, internally have some numbers that are -- if TRICARE end up never paying us anything or if they don't start picking up payment until the end of the year, we're pretty confident that at some point throughout the year, we'll eventually get through this conversation with them and basically prove that, hey, we did everything you asked for, what's your problem. It's been very unclear exactly what it is they're looking for.

So -- and because TRICARE is such a big part of our revenue, we obviously the difference in the guidance we will give is many tens of millions dollars, if not more than $50 million, right? So therefore, we'd like to have a little more clarity into our dialogue with try before we get to revenue guidance. What we are doing is to make sure in a worst-case scenario, let's keep doing what we always should be doing, make sure we trim expenses and restructure the organization to be able to handle even worse case scenarios.

Avi Dahan

Okay. Great. And the last question is, what's your plan like to present at this April meeting with TRICARE? Have they told you any details on what they -- are they requesting anything? Or do you have, I guess, data to show them to whatever to help them figure it out whatever it is that they exactly need from you?

Anna Lucsok

Yeah. They gave us some vague guidance on what they're looking for. It's still very unclear what exactly their problem is. But we have lots of data to present to them on -- specifically regarding policies that we're following. We will be referring back to the 2022 audit and the findings of that audit and adjustments.

There were some directions we received during the audit that we'll be highlighting in that presentation. So that's mainly going to be our focus.

Avi Dahan

Thank you.

Operator

Yi Chen, H.C. Wainwright.

Yi Chen

Thank you for taking my question. Could you comment on what specific factors that triggered TRICARE to start reviewing your product claims? And is it a typical practice that's going to review process, payers will temporarily suspend payments?

Anna Lucsok

We're unclear on specific triggers at this point because they haven't communicated clearly what the issue is. As far as these type of reviews, I mean, post-payment reviews among payers are very common. We undergo multiple audits or post-payment reviews from several different payers on a monthly basis. Payment suspension is somewhat common. It's not the usual practice, but it happens with other payers as well.

Yi Chen

So are you worried that other players could potentially follow TRICARE and start reviewing claims and suspend payments to you?

Thomas Sandgaard

We don't see any connection. I mean it's across the board. We deal with 3,000 insurance companies every -- all the time. And these things happen with small insurance companies, large insurance carriers. TRICARE is a big one.

obviously. So therefore, we have taken this very conservative approach. But these guys all operate very independently. There's really no connection. And this is a government payer.

It's not in the private sector. So that's already there, but a big disconnect.

Yi Chen

And just trying to clarify, did you mention that this kind of process could potentially tick up to 12 months to resolve, the letter?

Anna Lucsok

Yeah. So the letter from Defense Health Agency stated, this is a temporary payment suspension and it could be up to 12 months. but we are given an opportunity to present an appeal within 30 days, which we have a meeting scheduled in the beginning of April, and we'll know more after that meeting.

Thomas Sandgaard

And yet they have been nerve to demand that we still treat and send supplies to existing patients and keep accepting new patients and treat them 100% like we always have, except they don't send us payment in the meantime. Not very nice, but that's the reality, at least now.

Yi Chen

Does claims made to TRICARE cover a specific territories in the country or it's across the country?

Anna Lucsok

They're national. There across the country.

Thomas Sandgaard

Yeah. Actually, one of their letters had an interesting statement in It that we were one of their very valued providers and they really appreciate working with us. Yeah. Obviously, we provide opioid-free pain management to TRICARE patients. Obviously, it's a pretty big deal for what we do for all those patients.

Yi Chen

Great. Thank you for taking my question.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Thomas Sandgaard for closing remarks. Sir, please go ahead.

Thomas Sandgaard

Yeah. Thank you for joining us today. Although disappointing, we still overall, long term, pleased with our performance and where things are headed. And last year, obviously, we ended up with a decent financial result and the consistent growth that our team is delivering.

We look forward to leveraging our momentum and the changes we are making to the organization and the direction of our sales force throughout 2025, and we look forward to speaking to you at upcoming investor events.

We appreciate your time and interest in Zynex. Have a great day.

Wainwright adjusted its outlook on Zynex Inc. (NASDAQ: ), decreasing the 12-month price target from $17.00 to $15.00, while retaining a Buy rating on the stock. The decision came after Zynex reported its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results for 2024. According to InvestingPro data, the company currently trades at $7.00, near its 52-week low of $6.91, suggesting potential value opportunity for investors. The company experienced a year-over-year (YoY) decline of 3% in total revenue for the fourth quarter, totaling $46.0 million, which fell short of the expected $53.7 million.

The revenue shortfall was attributed to delayed payments from a payor, with Tricare having temporarily suspended payments for a review of prior claims. Tricare’s suspension is significant as it accounts for about 20-25% of Zynex’s annual revenue. The company reported a net loss of $0.6 million, or ($0.02) per share, which is below the projected income of $2.8 million.

Despite the fourth-quarter setback, Zynex’s full-year 2024 results showed a 4.4% YoY growth in total revenue, reaching $192.4 million. The company also reported a net income of $3.0 million, or $0.09 per share. Notably, Zynex saw a 16% increase in orders for the year. InvestingPro subscribers can access detailed analysis of Zynex’s financial health, including 10+ additional ProTips and comprehensive valuation metrics in the Pro Research Report, helping investors make more informed decisions during this transitional period.

In response to the current challenges, Zynex is reducing its overall staff by 15%, which is expected to save about $35 million annually. The company continues to expand payor coverage, which could help mitigate some of the near-term sales impact. Zynex’s management anticipates a minimum revenue of $30 million and a diluted EPS of ($0.30) or better for the first quarter of 2025.

Zynex is scheduled to meet with Tricare in April, with hopes that payments will be reinstated. However, the timeline for resolving this issue remains uncertain. H.C. Wainwright believes that although the growth rate of orders may slow down, it will continue to increase in upcoming quarters. Consequently, the firm’s estimated market value has been revised to $472 million, or approximately $15 per share, leading to the updated price target.

In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, with earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.02, missing analysts’ expectations of $0.10. The company’s revenue was $45.98 million, falling short of the anticipated $53.3 million, signaling challenges in meeting market expectations. Additionally, Zynex disclosed a slower-than-usual receipt of payments from certain payers, including a temporary suspension of payments by Tricare, which accounts for 20-25% of the company’s sales. This development has led the company to refrain from issuing guidance for 2025 and plan a 15% workforce reduction to align costs with anticipated revenue levels.

RBC Capital Markets downgraded Zynex’s stock from Outperform to Sector Perform, reducing its price target from $11.00 to $5.50, citing operational concerns highlighted during the earnings call. The firm expressed worries about the potential for further complications with other payers following the issues with Tricare. Despite these challenges, Zynex maintains a strong gross profit margin of 78% and is focusing on diversifying into patient monitoring technologies, with anticipated revenue from this segment expected in late 2025 or 2026 pending FDA clearance.

Zynex’s cash on the balance sheet increased by 5% from the previous quarter to $39.6 million, providing some financial cushion amid the current uncertainties. The company is actively working with Tricare to resolve the payment suspension, with a meeting scheduled for April to address the issue. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring Zynex’s ability to manage its payer relationships and adjust its cost structure as it navigates these operational headwinds.

My Military Health’s Scheduled Virtual Visits, a new DHA service, integrates virtual, automated, and digital multi-specialty healthcare into a patient's overall care journey. This platform increases access to care for Airmen that is safe, convenient, and confidential.

All trained Mental Health technicians can operate this new platform across Cannon AFB. This virtual option enables Air Commandos to continue their mental health care regardless of their physical location, ensuring continuity of care for Air Commandos even when deployed, on leave, or at temporary duty locations leading to fewer cancellations.

“It provides Airmen more flexibility with their care,” said the mental health flight commander at the 27th SODMG. “Let’s say you had an appointment scheduled for today and things are just not going well, instead of still trying to drag yourself into the building, or cancelling, you can switch your appointment to virtual seamlessly.""

This new system fully integrates with MHS Genesis, supporting providers by delivering increased access to a comprehensive view of their patients care history.

Implementing this new system comes at a time when virtual healthcare is proving increasingly vital, particularly in the realm of accessibility to mental health care. Notably, Cannon AFB experienced a 63% increase in virtual mental health appointments from 2023 to 2024.

This surge in demand highlights the growing acceptance and use of telehealth as a crucial resource for Airmen seeking mental health support.

While walk-ins and scheduled in-person visits with mental health providers remain available, the virtual option helps eliminate potential stigmas associated with seeking help. Virtual mental health care also provides more privacy, resulting in more Airmen seeking the help they need.

“The negative stigma or the fear of being seen walking to mental health has become a barrier to care for military members of all ranks.” said a 27th SOMDG Group Practice Manager. “Thankfully, increases in access to virtual care are drastically helping us to combat that stigma.”

The convenience and confidentiality offered by telehealth platforms like “My Military Health’s Scheduled Virtual Visits” empower Airmen to prioritize their mental wellbeing.

For dependents and DoD civilian employees, access to virtual mental health care services, including psychiatry, is available through the Telemynd platform.

The 27th SOMDG is confident the transition to My Military Health’s Scheduled Virtual Visit system will enhance healthcare delivery and improve the overall well-being of Air Commandos at Cannon.

According to InvestingPro data, three analysts have recently revised their earnings estimates downward for the upcoming period. This decision comes after Zynex provided a less-than-optimistic update during its fourth-quarter earnings call, which raised concerns about the company’s visibility into its operations and future business performance.

Zynex disclosed a slower-than-usual receipt of payments from certain payers during the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company received a notification from Tricare, its largest payer, which accounts for 20-25% of Zynex’s sales exposure, about a temporary suspension of payments to review previous claims. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong financial position with a current ratio of 3.94 and an impressive gross margin of 79.7%. This news is particularly troubling for the company as it could significantly impact revenue streams.

In response to the uncertainties, Zynex has decided not to issue guidance for 2025. Furthermore, the company is planning to reduce its workforce by approximately 15% in an effort to align its cost base with the anticipated new revenue levels. These measures indicate that Zynex is entering a period of restructuring to stabilize its business.

The revised price target from RBC Capital reflects the potential risks associated with the loss of its largest payer. The analysts at RBC Capital expressed concerns about the possibility of a domino effect, where the issues with Tricare might lead to further complications with other payers, potentially exacerbating the company’s financial challenges.

Investors are likely to keep a close eye on Zynex’s next moves as it navigates through these operational headwinds. The company’s ability to manage its payer relationships and adjust its cost structure will be critical in determining its financial health and stock performance going forward. Notably, InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis suggests the stock may be undervalued at current levels, despite the operational challenges.

In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, missing analysts’ expectations. The company recorded an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.02, falling short of the projected $0.10, with revenue reported at $45.98 million, below the expected $53.3 million. This performance marks a decline in net revenue compared to the same quarter last year, where revenue stood at $47.3 million. Zynex’s financial outlook for the first quarter of 2025 anticipates revenue of $30 million and a projected net loss between $9 million and $10 million, partly due to a temporary TRICARE payment suspension affecting short-term guidance. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong gross profit margin of 78% and has increased its cash on the balance sheet by 5% from the previous quarter. The company is also focusing on diversifying into patient monitoring technologies, with anticipated revenue from this segment expected in late 2025 or 2026, pending FDA clearance of its new pulse oximeter. Analysts from firms such as Ladenburg and RBC have shown interest in Zynex’s strategies to address these issues, particularly the TRICARE payment suspension. The company remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects, with CEO Thomas Sandgaard highlighting ongoing efforts to adapt to market changes and maintain investments in the business.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said.","Zynex Inc (NASDAQ:ZYXI) reported full-year revenue has grown 4% to reach $192.4 million in the 2024 financial year.

The medical technology company specializing in non-invasive devices for pain management, rehabilitation and patient monitoring saw 16% year-over-year growth in orders in 2024.

Net income for the year was $3 million or $0.09 per share, with cash flow from operations totaling $12.7 million.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard told shareholders that the firm is confident that its pain management business has ""significant growth potential"" in the long term, citing ongoing payer expansion efforts and progress with its NiCO laser pulse oximeter clinical trial, which produced positive results.

The NiCO pulse oximeter uses advanced laser technology to measure fractional blood oxygenation levels, offering greater accuracy than LED-based pulse oximeters, which have been found to misread oxygen levels in some populations, particularly individuals with darker skin tones.

""Over the long term we believe we will remain a leader of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management and patient monitoring and continue to pursue additional lines of revenue that improve patient outcomes and overall health,"" Sandgaard said in a statement.

For Q1 2025, Zynex expects revenue of at least $30 million.

Good relations with Tricare

For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $46 million compared to $47.3 million in the year-ago quarter.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the shortfall to due to slower payments from some insurers and a temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, which represents 20% to 25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said. “We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated.”

To address this, Zynex is reducing staff by 15%, focusing on corporate roles, which along with other expense cuts is expected to save $35 million annually.

“Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately,” Sandgaard said.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMTAtMjMtYXQtMS0wMi0zOC1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,1.0,2025-03-12 00:50:24.966292
