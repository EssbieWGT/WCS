Al-Haq’s case, filed on behalf of the Palestinian population in Gaza and the occupied territories, focused solely on exports from the Netherlands to Israel and Dutch commercial ties with settlements.
The proceedings did not concern Dutch imports of Israeli-made weapons or goods from settlements.
The court noted that the Dutch State has already taken several steps, including denying export licenses for military goods if there is a risk they could be used in Gaza.
Aside from that ruling, the court said it did not take into account any developments that occurred after September 3.","The Dutch government is not legally obligated to impose further measures against Israel over its military actions in Gaza or its settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territories, The Hague Court of Appeal ruled on Thursday.

The ruling came after the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq, joined by nine other advocacy groups, appealed to force the Netherlands to act more decisively to prevent what they describe as genocide and serious human rights violations by Israel in Gaza. Al-Haq’s case, filed on behalf of the Palestinian population in Gaza and the occupied territories, focused solely on exports from the Netherlands to Israel and Dutch commercial ties with settlements. The proceedings did not concern Dutch imports of Israeli-made weapons or goods from settlements.

The organizations demanded that the State immediately halt the export of military goods and trained dogs to Israel and take action against Dutch companies engaged in trade with businesses operating in illegal Israeli settlements. They argued that the Netherlands is not only morally but also legally bound under the Genocide Convention to prevent such atrocities.

The Hague Court of Appeal rejected those demands, stating that while it is “plausible that there is a risk of genocide and serious human rights violations,” it is not for the judiciary to dictate which specific measures the government must take in matters of foreign policy.

The court noted that the Dutch State has already taken several steps, including denying export licenses for military goods if there is a risk they could be used in Gaza. “The court must exercise restraint in assessing political decisions,” the ruling said.

Al-Haq also sought to ban the export of trained dogs that could allegedly be used by the Israeli Defense Forces to attack Palestinians. The State denied that claim, and the government’s attorney argued that such dogs are not classified as “dual-use goods,” meaning they cannot be restricted under existing export laws. According to the court, introducing such a ban would require a legislative change, which the judiciary is not authorized to order.

The court further found no sufficient grounds to compel the government to act against Dutch companies trading with entities in illegal settlements, saying there is no evidence that the current discouragement policy is ineffective.

The government’s lawyer also pointed out that other actions have already been taken, including entry bans for two far-right Israeli ministers. The plaintiffs dismissed those measures as “too little too late,” arguing they fail to meet the Netherlands’ international obligations.

The oral hearing took place on September 3, 2025. The court also considered the Supreme Court’s October 3, 2025, decision in the separate “F-35 case,” which involved the export of F-35 fighter jet components to Israel. Aside from that ruling, the court said it did not take into account any developments that occurred after September 3.

The court’s decision leaves in place the State’s current policy, which restricts certain military exports and discourages trade with settlements but stops short of a full embargo or legislative changes sought by the activists.",https://nltimes.nl/sites/nltimes.nl/files/styles/news_article_full_desktop_2x/public/2025-11/Gaza_war_2023_-_2025_IMG_5406.jpg?h=eaab21c9,N,0.0,2025-11-06 20:00:15.390266

Although most respiratory illnesses share common symptoms, the flu is more serious than the common cold. It can lead to hospitalization and even death in severe cases. Flu season generally runs through fall and winter, and one of the best things you can do to protect your health is get a flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the flu vaccine for all people aged 6 months and older (with rare exceptions).

“There are multiple benefits to getting the flu vaccine,” said Jeannine Pickrell, MS, RN, Population Health, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Not only are you taking precautions to keep yourself healthy during the fall and winter months, but you’re also taking steps to protect the community, including family and loved ones.”

Learn how to get your TRICARE-covered flu vaccine today.

When is the best time to get vaccinated?

Generally, September and October are the best months to get the flu vaccine. Getting it too early can limit the effectiveness of the vaccine. However, getting the vaccine later in the flu season still has benefits, since the virus will still be circulating. Flu season usually peaks in February and can continue into May.

According to the CDC, there are some populations who are at higher risk for having complications from the flu. It’s especially important for people in these groups to get the flu vaccine. This group includes:

People aged 65 and older

People with certain chronic medical conditions

Pregnant women

Children younger than 5 years old (and especially children under 2)

Additionally, if you’re a health care worker or live with populations who are at high risk for flu complications, it’s important to get vaccinated.

What version of the vaccine should I get?

There are many different versions of the flu vaccine. Which one you should get depends on your age, health conditions, and preferences. Consult with your provider to determine which version of the vaccine is best for you.

Where can I get vaccinated?

There are three ways you can get these vaccines at no cost, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider (like a doctor or nurse practitioner) gives you a vaccine at a participating pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

Note: Before getting the vaccine, call to check if you need an appointment and if the vaccine is available. Remember to bring your Uniformed Services ID card.

Recognizing flu symptoms

The most common flu symptoms include:

Fever

Cough

Sore throat

Runny or stuffy nose

Body aches

Tiredness

You can have the flu before symptoms appear, so getting vaccinated can help prevent you from getting the most prominent strains of the influenza virus. Even if you do get sick, the symptoms may be less severe if you’ve received a flu vaccine.

Other steps to prevent spreading the flu include:

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick

Covering coughs and sneezes

Washing your hands often

Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth

If you do get sick, it’s important to stay home until you’ve been fever-free for 24 hours and your symptoms are improving.

Talk to your provider if you have questions about vaccines. For more information on TRICARE’s vaccine coverage, check out Immunizations.

Therapies were limited and providers often didn’t accept Tricare, the Defense Department health insurance plan for military families.

Air Force Master Sgt. Jason and Latoya Singleton arrived at Yokota four years ago with their son, Jasir, who is on the autism spectrum.

They quickly learned how difficult navigating the Exceptional Family Member Program can be overseas, Latoya Singleton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 17 at Yokota’s Yujo Community Center. Therapies were limited and providers often didn’t accept Tricare, the Defense Department health insurance plan for military families.

The Singletons pieced together therapies in Tokyo, often paying out of pocket. Over time, they became the “go-to” family for others seeking guidance, she said.

“We were literally paying everything out of pocket for all his therapies,” she said. “Eventually, therapists started referring new families to us and saying, ‘This is the family you want to talk to.’”

This spring, Singleton created Yokota Thrives, a network of nearly 50 families that share resources and push for inclusive base events.

“I wanted to open up a community where people could feel safe,” she said. “There’s still a stigma in the military, especially overseas, that if your child has autism you’ll automatically get sent back. That’s not true. There are a lot of kids here, and they still need resources.”

Kristi Forbes, a registered nurse at Yokota Middle School, said her son has non-verbal learning disability, a new diagnosis not officially on the autism spectrum. She often seeks advice on Yokota Thrives’ Facebook page.

“The group has been very helpful because even though it’s not the same diagnosis that most of the parents are dealing with, there’s a lot of similarities,” she said by phone on Sept. 19.

In the first Defense Department survey across the EFMP between November 2022 and March 2023, only 43% of enrolled members said their families’ needs were “largely met,” while 17% reported they weren’t met at all.

For parents overseas, the hurdles multiply.

“When we first got here, [Applied Behavior Analysis] therapy wasn’t available at all,” Singleton said. “We were driving an hour and a half into Tokyo and paying out of pocket. Now there’s a provider that takes Tricare, so that’s a big improvement.”

Yokota Thrives is pushing for sensory-friendly hours at the library and swimming pool, adjusted lighting at events and better advertisement of EFMP programs, she said. During a July 24 spouses’ luncheon with 374th Airlift Wing commander Col. Richard McElhaney, Singleton discussed her ideas with him and other leaders.

“I talked to them about it, and they were like, ‘You know, that’s a good idea. You know, this is something that we should look into.’”

Later, she met with the Force Support Squadron and EFMP representatives to discuss her overall vision.

“They told me, ‘Our spaces are already EFMP-friendly,’” she said. “But just because the physical space is there doesn’t mean the social aspect works for our kids.”

The USO, for example, gave Yokota Thrives the first hour of its Aug. 20 Summer Splash as a sensory-friendly option. Neurodivergent children played outside with bubble makers and water guns or painted and customized shirts.

“USO cares about all military families,” USO event coordinator Amber Laughton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 19. “We try our best to do whatever we can do to create that inclusive space and environment.

The Singletons expect Yokota Thrives to continue thriving after they depart Yokota in March.

“Even if there are no events, I want it to continue to be a safe space. A place where you can go for resources,” Latoya Singleton said. “The biggest thing is inclusion, not just existing.”",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/57qnx1-071125yokota-thrivesphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/071125YOKOTA-THRIVESphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-06 09:00:38.933279

📘 Legal References Supporting California Recognition California Family Code §359: Authorizes marriage license issuance by Deputy Commissioners.
12): Recognizes California marriages for immigration.","💍 Introduction: The Hidden Risk of Online Marriages for Military Couples

For military couples, a legal marriage isn’t just about love — it’s about security, stability, and access to benefits that protect both spouses. Health care through TRICARE, housing through BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing), and family recognition through DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) are all tied directly to your marital status.

But not all marriages are recognized equally by the U.S. military.

While Utah’s online marriage system has made headlines for being fast and fully virtual, many service members are finding out too late that a virtual ceremony doesn’t automatically qualify for military benefits.

This guide explains why, under Department of Defense policy, Utah’s online marriages can cause delays or denials in DEERS, TRICARE, and BAH — and why Get Married Today in California offers the only guaranteed path to full and immediate recognition.

⚖️ What Is a Utah Online Marriage?

Utah County allows couples to get married entirely online — no travel required. You can apply for a license and have an officiant marry you via video conference. It’s quick, affordable, and legally valid under U.S. state law.

For civilian couples, this is often a convenient option. The certificate is valid for name changes, taxes, and even immigration.

However, the military follows a separate recognition standard, and that’s where problems begin.

🪖 The Military’s Legal Standard for Recognizing Marriages

According to DoD Instruction 1000.25 and 1341.2, the military will only recognize a marriage if it is legally valid in the jurisdiction where it took place and both parties were physically present at the ceremony.

Proxy or virtual marriages — even if legal under state law — require proof of consummation before they’re recognized for:

DEERS enrollment

TRICARE health coverage

BAH payments

Military ID card issuance

Overseas dependent sponsorship

This means that a marriage performed online, where neither spouse was physically together, isn’t valid for benefits until consummation occurs and can be proven.

⚠️ Real-World Consequences for Service Members

Many service members discover these rules only after applying for benefits:

TRICARE Denials: The spouse isn’t added to the system until physical presence is proven.

Delayed BAH: Payments are withheld because the marriage is under review.

Command Issues: Units may require additional affidavits or proof.

Stress and Financial Strain: Couples lose months of housing pay and coverage.

For couples preparing for deployment, these delays can create serious hardship.

💒 The California Advantage — In-Person Marriage with Get Married Today

In California, Get Married Today performs fully legal, in-person marriages that meet every DoD requirement for immediate recognition.

When both spouses are physically present, the marriage certificate is automatically valid for:

DEERS Enrollment

TRICARE Activation

BAH and Dependent Pay

SGLI Beneficiary Updates

Command Recognition and Housing Access

You walk away the same day with proof of marriage — ready to update your records on base without delay.

⚡ How Get Married Today Simplifies the Entire Process

Instant Marriage License: Issued on-site by a California Deputy Commissioner of Civil Marriages.

Same-Day Legal Ceremony: In-person and compliant with DoD rules.

Immediate Proof: You leave with documentation to enroll your spouse in DEERS.

Certified Copies: Ready for TRICARE and finance offices within days.

Apostille Option: For overseas commands or foreign spouses.

This process ensures zero risk of rejection or benefit delays.

✈️ Why This Matters for Deployed or Stationed Military Members

If you’re preparing for deployment, you don’t have time for administrative delays. A Utah online marriage may require weeks of review and additional proof, while a California in-person marriage is recognized instantly.

That means your spouse’s healthcare, housing, and dependent status are secured before you leave.

📜 Department of Defense Policies Explained

Key DoD References:

DoDI 1000.25 – Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)

DoDI 1341.2 – BAH and Dependent Pay Policies

These instructions state that a marriage must be legally valid under state law and involve physical presence. The requirement exists to prevent fraud and ensure documentation integrity across all branches.

Because it’s the only service that guarantees same-day legal marriage and instant recognition for TRICARE, BAH, and all military benefits.","💍 Introduction: The Power of a Recognized Marriage

For active-duty and reserve military members, marriage isn’t only a personal commitment — it’s the key to unlocking essential protections and benefits. From TRICARE health coverage to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), DEERS registration, and SGLI spousal coverage, everything begins once your marriage is recognized by the Department of Defense (DoD).

However, not all marriages are recognized equally.

While Utah’s online marriage system has become a popular way to marry remotely, the DoD does not automatically accept virtual ceremonies where one or both spouses are not physically present.

If you want your marriage to be instantly valid for military benefits, the safest, fastest, and most reliable choice is a same-day, in-person legal marriage in California through Get Married Today.

🪖 Why Military Recognition Is So Important

Military benefits are only activated once your marriage is recorded in DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System). That enrollment allows:

TRICARE healthcare to start

BAH payments to increase

Base housing and dependent privileges

Spousal ID card issuance

Access to family support programs

If your marriage is not recognized — which can happen with online or proxy ceremonies — all these benefits are delayed or denied until you provide proof that the marriage is consummated.

⚖️ Utah Online Marriage vs. DoD Recognition

Utah’s system allows couples to apply online and hold a video ceremony anywhere in the world. While legal under state law, it does not satisfy the DoD’s physical presence rule.

The Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1000.25 explicitly states that, for DEERS and benefits eligibility:

“Both parties must be physically present at the ceremony, or the marriage must be consummated after the ceremony to be recognized.”

That means:

If you marry online and haven’t physically met afterward, your marriage will not count for DEERS or TRICARE.

Proof of consummation must be provided (travel records, photos, affidavits, etc.) before benefits begin.

For service members about to deploy, this can be a serious setback.

✅ The California Advantage: Same-Day Recognition

When you get married through Get Married Today, you meet every federal and military requirement instantly.

California marriages are performed in person, ensuring:

Physical presence is verified and certified.

DEERS acceptance is automatic.

TRICARE coverage starts immediately after enrollment.

BAH and dependent pay are activated the same pay cycle.

SGLI and command records can be updated instantly.

You leave legally married with all the documents you need to prove your status that same day.

⚡ How Get Married Today Works

Marriage License Issued Immediately No need to visit the county clerk — Get Married Today issues your legal license on-site under California Family Code §359.

In-Person Ceremony The officiant performs a legal ceremony with both spouses physically present, satisfying all DoD standards.

Legal Filing and Proof of Marriage You receive same-day documentation to enroll your spouse in DEERS and activate benefits.

Certified Copies and Apostilles Fast options for overseas or international spouses are available through Orange County Apostille.

Guaranteed DoD Recognition Your marriage is valid immediately across all branches — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and Space Force.

✈️ For Military Members in a Hurry

Get Married Today is ideal for:

Deployment preparation — secure benefits before leaving.

Leave periods — get legally married while you’re home.

Overseas assignments — apostille certificates available for use abroad.

Dual-national couples — fast recognition for immigration and command sponsorship.

In as little as one hour, you can walk away married, recognized, and fully eligible for military benefits.

🕊️ The Cost of Waiting with Online or Proxy Marriages

Online marriages often create administrative confusion, delayed payments, and denied benefits. California marriages eliminate all those risks.

📘 Legal References Supporting California Marriages

California Family Code §359–360: Authorizes Deputy Commissioners to issue and solemnize marriages.

DoDI 1000.25: Establishes DEERS eligibility and physical presence standards.

DoDI 1341.2: Details dependent benefit eligibility and pay.

TRICARE Policy Manual: Recognizes lawful state marriages for immediate enrollment.

U.S. Department of State: Accepts California marriage certificates for international and federal use.

🪖 Real Case Example

A U.S. Army soldier stationed at Fort Irwin married online via Utah. When he tried to add his spouse to DEERS, the application was held for “proof of consummation.” His spouse couldn’t get TRICARE for nearly two months.

A fellow service member completed a same-day, in-person marriage through Get Married Today in California and enrolled his spouse in DEERS the next day — benefits were active by the end of the week.

The difference? Physical presence.

🌎 Benefits of Apostilled California Marriage Certificates

If you or your spouse are abroad, Get Married Today can provide a California-issued marriage certificate apostilled through Orange County Apostille, ensuring validity in over 120 countries under The Hague Convention.

This is essential for:

Overseas command sponsorship

Spousal visas

Residency and embassy registration

📊 Step-by-Step for Military Benefit Activation

Get legally married in person through Get Married Today.

Receive your official California marriage certificate.

Visit your base DEERS/Personnel Office.

Provide the certificate and both IDs.

Add your spouse to DEERS.

Wait 2–5 business days for TRICARE to activate.

Notify DFAS for BAH and dependent pay adjustment.

The good news? The TRICARE Dental Program covers emergency dental care, as noted in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook. You’ll pay no cost-share for emergency dental services, no matter your pay grade or location.

“In any emergency, it’s important to act quickly,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency. “With a bit of preparation and knowledge, you can do your best to keep any damage to a minimum.”

Keep reading to learn how to prepare for dental emergencies and what to do when they happen.

What is a dental emergency?

A dental emergency requires immediate attention. You need emergency care if you have:

Bleeding that won’t stop

Pain that doesn’t get better with medication

Broken facial bones

Painful swelling in or around your mouth

Gum infection with pain or swelling

Knocked out or broken tooth

How to prepare

Keep your dentist’s contact information with you at all times. Many dentists have emergency numbers you can call after business hours.

Build a dental emergency kit with these items:

Cotton balls and swabs

Dental floss

Dental mirror

Latex or vinyl gloves

Salt

Cold compress

What to do

Call your dentist first. This is the most important step in any dental emergency. If you don’t have a dentist, use the Find a Dentist tool or go to an urgent care center or emergency room.

For severe tooth pain

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Use dental floss to remove any stuck food.

Apply a cold compress to the outside of your mouth if you have swelling.

Take over-the-counter pain relievers.

For a cracked or broken tooth

Save any broken pieces and rinse them.

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Apply gauze to bleeding areas for 10 minutes.

Use a cold compress on the outside of your mouth to reduce pain and swelling.

For a knocked-out tooth

Find the tooth and hold it by the crown.

Rinse the root gently with water.

Try to put the tooth back in its socket if possible.

If you can’t put it back, place it in a small container of milk or salt water.

See your dentist within one hour for the best chance of saving the tooth.

For mouth bleeding

Rinse with mild salt water.

Press a damp gauze on the bleeding spot for 15-20 minutes.

Hold a cold compress on the outside of your mouth for 5-10 minutes.

If bleeding persists, go to the emergency room immediately.

When it’s not an emergency

Some dental problems can wait for a regular appointment:

Mild toothache

Small chip or crack

Broken braces (unless bleeding)

Something stuck between teeth

Minor cuts or sores

If you seek emergency dental care, but your dentist determines it’s not an emergency, you’ll pay the cost-shares for the care you receive.

For these issues, call your dentist to schedule an appointment during normal hours.

Emergency room or dentist?

For most dental emergencies like broken or knocked-out teeth, your dentist will treat you in his or her office. Go to the emergency room for serious injuries like broken facial bones.

Emergency rooms can give you pain medication and antibiotics, but they don’t do dental work like fillings or crowns. You’ll still need to see your dentist as soon as possible.

Dental emergencies need quick action. The faster you get help, the better your chances of saving your teeth and avoiding additional problems later. Remember:

Call your dentist.

Follow first aid steps until you can get professional care.

Don’t wait, prompt treatment prevents infection and tooth loss.

Koper spent 32 years in uniform, all of it in the Ohio Air National Guard. Before retiring in 1996, he led the first Ohio Air Guard visit to the Republic of Hungary, the state’s State Partnership Program partner.

During his time at NGAUS, the association secured congressional approval of low-cost TRICARE Reserve Select medical coverage for most drill-status Guardsmen.

Koper also launched the effort to correct an oversight in the original language of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Initially, it did not include benefits for those serving on active duty during the Global War on Terrorism in a Title 32 status service.

And he was at association’s controls when Congress approved a fourth star for National Guard Bureau chief.

Retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the current NGAUS president, began his 15 years on the association board near the end of Koper’s time in the position.

“He was a tireless, passionate advocate for the National Guard in the 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia,” McGinn said. “He was a great role model for all of us who have had the privilege of following him.”

Koper was also a member of the National Guard Educational Foundation’s Legion de Lafayette, which is reserved for large benefactors of the foundation, McGinn noted.

Before coming to NGAUS, he served as executive director of the Ohio National Guard Association from 1995 to 2004 and as president of the National Guard Executive Directors Association in 2000.

In 2006, he received the Colonel James F. Gamble Award, NGEDA’s highest honor for support

of the member states and activities.

Also successful in business, he was the president of S. K. Graphics Inc., a print consulting and brokerage firm. He also did a stint as a director and subsequently chairman of the Printing Industries Association of Southern Ohio.

BiomX (PHGE, Financial) receives FDA endorsement for its BX011 phage therapy targeting diabetic foot infections (DFI).

Significant non-dilutive funding of $40 million from U.S. Defense Health Agency and Department of Navy supports development.

BiomX operates in the biotechnology sector, focusing on phage therapies for chronic diseases.

BiomX (PHGE) has received affirmative feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding its clinical development strategy for BX011. This novel multi-phage cocktail aims to combat Staphylococcus aureus in diabetic foot infections (DFI). The FDA's input endorses BiomX’s progression of its phage therapy for DFIs as the next clinical application, building on the prior Phase 2 study of BX211, which targeted diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) linked to S. aureus.

The focus on DFI is driven by three main factors: a larger patient base with unfulfilled medical needs, substantial commercial potential, and a distinct regulatory route informed by established FDA guidelines. As both DFI and DFO involve the S. aureus pathogen, DFI is positioned as the initial indication for regulatory approval before exploring further DFO development. BX011 is composed of multiple proprietary phages, including those assessed in the BX211 study.

Approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from U.S. Defense Health Agency and the Department of Navy supports BiomX's efforts. Moving forward, further development of BX011 will align with dialogues with the U.S. Defense Health Agency and depend on financial resources to commence a Phase 2a trial in DFIs. The FDA has provided a clear path for a potential Biologics License Application, with no additional non-clinical studies required, affirming BiomX’s manufacturing and quality strategies.

Company Overview and Market Position

BiomX Inc is engaged in developing both natural and engineered phage cocktails and personalized treatments designed to target and destroy harmful bacteria in chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and diabetic foot osteomyelitis. It discovers and validates proprietary bacterial targets and customizes phage compositions against these targets, applying its BOLT (BacteriOphage Lead to Treatment) platform. The company operates within the Healthcare sector, specifically in the Biotechnology industry, with a market capitalization of approximately $11.25 million.

Financial Health Analysis

BiomX's financial health presents several challenges:

Revenue growth remains stagnant with zero revenue reported, indicating a focus on development rather than commercialization.

Profitability metrics are concerning, with a negative EPS of -1.01 and a ROE of -69.73%.

The balance sheet shows a current ratio of 2.66, indicating adequate liquidity, but the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.49 suggests moderate leverage.

Valuation and Market Sentiment

BiomX's valuation metrics reflect its distressed status:

The P/B ratio stands at 21.19, indicating a high valuation relative to book value.

Technical indicators show a RSI-14 of 35.83, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory.

Institutional ownership is at 35.28%, with minimal insider activity, reflecting cautious market sentiment.
