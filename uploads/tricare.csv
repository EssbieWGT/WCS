Health care coverage is critical to increasing long-term readiness and strengthening efforts to recruit and retain service members.
“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad.
“Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them.
The bill would provide all service members with access to health services provided by network providers with no cost-sharing burden.","Legislation introduced last week by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., would ensure premium-free medical insurance coverage is provided for all members of the National Guard and Reserve.

If passed, the Healthcare for our Troops Act would give Guard and Reserve members access to no-fee health care through TRICARE Reserve Select.

Currently, TRS charges a fee for medical and dental coverage.

Health care coverage is critical to increasing long-term readiness and strengthening efforts to recruit and retain service members.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president.

“Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

In remarks made at the 147th NGAUS General Conference & Exhibition in Milwaukee, Aug. 23, Baldwin noted that about 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists lack private health insurance.

“I believe it is morally wrong. It is bad for preparedness and readiness. And, yes, we need to change it,” Baldwin told the audience.

Baldwin was the 2025 recipient of the Harry S. Truman Award, the association’s most prestigious honor. [Video of Baldwin’s remarks can be found here. They begin at 13:25.]

Besides expanding TRS, the bill would strengthen military readiness by ensuring access to needed physicals for no-notice deployments.

The bill also would incentivize employers to hire Guard and Reservists.

The bill would provide all service members with access to health services provided by network providers with no cost-sharing burden.

It would also facilitate more affordable access to critical preventive medical services as well as mental health care.",https://www.ngaus.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-08/baldwin082425final1000.jpg?itok=BenVB1py,N,0.0,2025-08-24 18:56:07.759967

In addition to providing health insurance, the legislation would provide servicemembers with the option to complete annual medical readiness requirements with their preferred civilian provider – giving commanders back valuable training days and saving over $162 million annually in contracted medical assessments.

Question

Avi Dahan, on for Shagun Singh, asked about the specifics of the 2022 TRICARE audit, the lack of advance warning on the payment suspension, and the rationale for not providing full-year 2025 guidance given that 75% of revenue is unaffected. He also questioned the company's plan for its upcoming April meeting with the Defense Health Agency.

Answer

Executive Anna Lucsok described the 2022 audit as a routine post-payment review with standard adjustments and no major issues identified. Executive Thomas Sandgaard explained that full-year guidance was withheld because the potential revenue impact from TRICARE is substantial, possibly exceeding $50 million, creating too much uncertainty. He emphasized the issue is isolated and not indicative of a domino effect with other payers. For the April meeting, Anna Lucsok stated they will present data on policy compliance and reference the adjustments made following the 2022 audit, although TRICARE's specific concerns remain vague.

Regarding the strategic review, Sandgaard confirmed the company has received letters of intent and is actively engaged with one party, though a resolution is not expected in the immediate future.

Officials want feedback on the content, navigation, visuals and layout of the website.

It comes at an opportune time, as Tricare’s open season begins Nov. 10, when people will be exploring their options for Tricare coverage. However, it’s not clear whether any recommendations for changes in the website would be implemented before open season.

Researchers are looking for participants from a variety of Tricare health plans, ages, locations and experiences.

Those eligible must be current Tricare beneficiaries who are at least 18 years old and have a computer or mobile device in order to access Tricare.mil and Microsoft Teams. A Microsoft Teams account is not required. Participants must have a stable internet connection, the ability to share their screen and a working microphone. They must be available on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time.

Participants don’t need a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate.

Researchers and the Tricare communications team will use the data to help update and redesign different parts of the Tricare.mil site. The Defense Health Agency won’t publicly share names or information of study participants, but participants will be asked to share their input with other participants on the call.

Those who want to participate should send an email by Wednesday, Sept. 3, to dha.jblm.solution-deliv.list.dha-usability-lab@health.mil.

Include “Tricare Usability Study” in the email subject line, and in the email, provide your name, age, location, Tricare health plan, how long you’ve been a Tricare beneficiary and your beneficiary category, such as active duty service member, retiree, or active duty family member, for example.

Participants will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis. Researchers may not be able to include everyone due to capacity constraints.

CPAP sent a breach notification letter to numerous impacted individuals, informing them of the 2024 cyberattack. According to the letter, cybercrooks breached CPAP’s network between December 13th and December 21st of last year.

Information the company submitted to the Maine Attorney General’s Office revealed that over 90,000 individuals were impacted by the attack.

CPAP provides sleep therapy gear. The company’s website strongly emphasizes its focus on US military personnel. CPAP also accepts Tricare, a US Defense Department health program for service members.

“We commenced a prompt and thorough investigation into the incident and worked very closely with external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of situations to help determine whether any personal or sensitive data had been compromised as a result of this incident,” reads the data breach notice.

Meanwhile, the data breach notice that CPAP posted on its website indicates that attackers may have accessed customer names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), and other “identifiable protected health and personal information.”

Individuals whose data may have been stolen could experience increased levels of cybersecurity threats. For example, attackers could leverage the stolen data for identity theft. Cybercrooks could also use the details to craft phishing attacks by attempting to impersonate healthcare providers, hoping to lure additional sensitive details.

Depending on what health information was exposed, attackers could also attempt medical identity theft. Medical details are a prized possession in the cyber underworld, as they enable attackers to file fraudulent insurance claims and prescriptions for regulated drugs.

While CPAP pointed out that it has no indication that exposed details were misused, the company said it will offer affected individuals complimentary credit and identity monitoring services.

Healthcare institutions are among the most targeted. According to research from the Business Digital Index, the majority of the largest US hospitals have recently dealt with cyberattacks and data breaches. For example, in 2024, healthcare-related data breaches led to the theft of over 267 million records.",https://media.cybernews.com/images/featured-big/2025/06/patient-data-breached.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-23 11:56:07.701301

Want to help improve it? Now’s your chance to provide feedback on the usability of the site and suggestions for improving it.

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for Tricare beneficiaries to participate in research via remote meetings between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5. The lab will hold several studies, asking participants to test out specific scenarios. Each session will last about one hour.

Officials want feedback on the content, navigation, visuals and layout of the website.

It comes at an opportune time, as Tricare’s open season begins Nov. 10, when people will be exploring their options for Tricare coverage. However, it’s not clear whether any recommendations for changes in the website would be implemented before open season.

Researchers are looking for participants from a variety of Tricare health plans, ages, locations and experiences.

Those eligible must be current Tricare beneficiaries who are at least 18 years old and have a computer or mobile device in order to access Tricare.mil and Microsoft Teams. A Microsoft Teams account is not required. Participants must have a stable internet connection, the ability to share their screen and a working microphone. They must be available on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time.

Participants don’t need a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate.

Researchers and the Tricare communications team will use the data to help update and redesign different parts of the Tricare.mil site. The Defense Health Agency won’t publicly share names or information of study participants, but participants will be asked to share their input with other participants on the call.

Those who want to participate should send an email by Wednesday, Sept. 3, to dha.jblm.solution-deliv.list.dha-usability-lab@health.mil.

Include “Tricare Usability Study” in the email subject line, and in the email, provide your name, age, location, Tricare health plan, how long you’ve been a Tricare beneficiary and your beneficiary category, such as active duty service member, retiree, or active duty family member, for example.

Participants will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis. Researchers may not be able to include everyone due to capacity constraints.

If you’re not able to join the study, beneficiaries may submit feedback via the Tricare.mil questionnaire.

Rescission reinforces regulatory clarity and aligns with energy security priorities.
Instead of vague, top-down “wellness” mandates, CRF called for targeted, clinically grounded interventions for students with diagnosed mental illness.
She endorsed creating a congressional regulatory office to complement OIRA, helping lawmakers write clearer statutes and evaluate regulations over time.","This week, CPAC's Center for Regulatory Freedom (CRF) submitted formal comments across four federal rulemakings. In each case, we raised serious concerns about the ongoing importance of peeling back the regulatory excesses of the unelected bureaucracy in recent years:

1. DHA’s Misuse of Credit Checks for Health Access (DOD-2025-HA-0006)

CRF challenged the Defense Health Agency’s policy of using “soft” credit checks and credit card data as identity verification for access to MHS GENESIS. Not only does this compromise privacy and invite confusion, but it also creates unnecessary barriers to care for young dependents and low-income families. There is no clear legal authority for this requirement, and it appears to have been implemented without public input or congressional notification.

2. DOI’s Smart Move on Offshore Wind Mandates (BOEM-2025-0036)

CRF supported the Department of the Interior’s direct final rule rescinding the outdated requirement to publish a five-year offshore renewable energy leasing schedule. The rule had no statutory foundation and falsely signaled inevitable lease sales, distorting markets. Rescission reinforces regulatory clarity and aligns with energy security priorities.

3. EPA’s New Source Review Paperwork Buildup (EPA-HQ-OAR-2022-0037)

CRF urged EPA to remain vigilant against growing paperwork burdens from information collection requests tied to solid waste incinerators and combustion turbines. While EPA has improved burden estimates, CRF stressed the cumulative impact of overlapping mandates that harm energy sector investment and competitiveness.

4. DOE’s Misguided School Mental Health Expansion (ED-2025-OESE-0153)

CRF opposed the Department of Education’s proposed expansion of school-based mental health programs, citing lack of evidence, parental rights concerns, and ideological risk. Instead of vague, top-down “wellness” mandates, CRF called for targeted, clinically grounded interventions for students with diagnosed mental illness.

Regulatory Reform in the News

Dr. Susan Dudley on Congress’s Role After Loper

At a Senate hearing on July 30, former OIRA Administrator (and the founder of the George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center) Dr. Susan Dudley testified on the implications of the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, which overturned the Chevron doctrine. Dr. Dudley emphasized:

Courts, not agencies, will now interpret statutes—but agency expertise on technical matters will still matter.

Congress must draft laws with greater clarity, distinguishing between legal, factual, and policy questions.

Transparency is key: agencies must disclose their assumptions and acknowledge policy tradeoffs.

Overreliance on “science” as a cover for value judgments must stop; legislative accountability must return.

She endorsed creating a congressional regulatory office to complement OIRA, helping lawmakers write clearer statutes and evaluate regulations over time.

Upcoming Next Week

CPAC to Weigh In on Election Technology Security

The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking public comments on proposed updates to the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG 2.0), specifically regarding performance benchmarks for high-speed scanning equipment used in elections: EAC-2025-0001-0006.

CRF will submit comments emphasizing the need for:

Election Integrity – Every vote must be verifiable, auditable, and secure.

Transparency – Voters and election observers must be able to understand and scrutinize election technologies.

Accountability – Election vendors and local officials must be held to the highest standards of performance.

Security – No system should be certified without rigorous, third-party-tested protections against manipulation.

We intend to use this opportunity to reaffirm that secure elections are the cornerstone of a free republic.

More than 39,000 employees at the Defense Health Agency are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, according to AFGE.

Certain jobs were exempted from the buyout program at the discretion of the network directors, the Defense Health Agency said.","WASHINGTON — The Defense Health Agency that oversees more than 700 military hospitals and clinics worldwide disclosed Thursday that it made a buyout offer to an unidentified number of civilian personnel to be considered for lump-sum payouts to leave their jobs under a restructuring of the federal agency.

The Defense Health Agency said it plans to grant the voluntary buyouts to certain employees on a job-by-job basis as part of a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment program. Employees were required to submit applications this week to express their interest in accepting an incentive payment to resign, the agency said. But the agency declined to discuss the specific terms outlined in the buyouts. But the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment Authority, also known as the buyout authority, allows federal agencies downsizing or restructuring to offer employees one-time payments of up to $25,000 as an incentive to resign from their jobs, according to the Office of Personnel Management.

The Defense Health Agency oversees the nation’s largest health-care system that serves a patient population of more than 9.5 million service members, retirees and their families.

“Any effort to slash the Department of Defense’s health care civilian workforce without a careful analysis is a threat to our national security and service members’ ability to access health care and other critical services,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

More than 39,000 employees at the Defense Health Agency are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, according to AFGE.

An AFGE spokesman said Thursday that the buyout offer is among several initiatives by the Defense Health Agency to draw down its workforce, including deferred resignations and early retirements. The agency’s offer of voluntary resignations follows an announcement by the Defense Department earlier this year that it would reduce its workforce by 5% to 8% as part of a larger downsizing of federal agencies ordered by President Donald Trump.

Network directors who manage the Defense Health Agency with a workforce of 130,000 were authorized to identify certain jobs to eliminate and ask employees to submit applications by Aug. 18, according to the agency. But an employee’s application for the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment, or VSIP, option does not guarantee an offer, the agency said.

“This is a voluntary program, and network directors retain authority to approve or disapprove of requests,” according to the agency. The agency also declined to identify the number of employees who turned in applications by a Monday deadline or the types of jobs targeted for downsizing. The agency’s decisions on the applications are expected by the end of August, according to AFGE.

Certain jobs were exempted from the buyout program at the discretion of the network directors, the Defense Health Agency said.

“Defense Health Agency network directors were authorized to offer the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment or VSIP incentive to shape their workforce and enable our military hospitals and clinics to deliver their capabilities and services within the scope of their facilities’ plans,” the agency said in a written statement.

An “agency may offer VSIP to employees who are in surplus positions or have skills that are no longer needed in the workforce who volunteer to separate by resignation,” according to the Office of Personnel Management. “Agencies such as the Department of Defense that have been granted agency-specific VSIP authority are not required to seek OPM approval for their use of this option.”

The Defense Health Agency is a combat support agency with a mission to provide and manage a medically ready force, according to the Defense Department.

The Defense Department is the nation’s largest employer, with more than 2.1 million service members and more than 800,000 civilian workers.",,N,0.0,2025-08-22 20:56:08.077383

The exclusion is for all access to GLP-1s for TFL beneficiaries that don’t meet the Medicare criteria.
Under the Tricare plan, Prime and Select patients continue to get their GLP-1s, TFL don't.
Nothing in § 1074g limits that availability to Prime/Select enrollees or excludes TRICARE For Life (TFL).
However, if your goal is to include GLP-1s on the uniform formulary for obesity alone, I would support that.","Nicely done. But, you’re only partly right, just not the right part:

True: Title 10 §1079 says “[t]reatment of obesity may not be provided if obesity is the sole or major condition treated.” That’s in 10 U.S.C. §1079(a)(10)—the basic CHAMPUS benefit baseline.

True: The 2017 carve‑out for Prime/Select (services) in DoD’s 2017 interim final rule, (IFR) implementing FY2017 NDAA authority, expressly allows treatment of obesity (even when it’s the sole/major condition) for TRICARE Prime and Select. That language is at 32 C.F.R. §199.17(f)(3).

BUT: What Tricare is proposing now is more than just excluding GLP-1s to TFL for treatment of obesity. The exclusion is for all access to GLP-1s for TFL beneficiaries that don’t meet the Medicare criteria. There are many TFL (and Prime and Select) beneficiaries on GLP-1s for conditions that include obesity coupled with comorbidities – satisfying Tricare criteria, but not Medicare criteria. Under the Tricare plan, Prime and Select patients continue to get their GLP-1s, TFL don't.

Where you overreach:

The Tricare pharmacy program sits on different legal rails than §1079.

TRICARE’s pharmacy benefit is authorized by 10 U.S.C. §1074g and implemented at 32 C.F.R. § 199.21. The regulation explicitly notes this law is independent of other Title 10 sections that govern TRICARE medical benefits, i.e., the § 1079 rules don’t automatically control the basic pharmacy program. The “uniform formulary” is for eligible covered beneficiaries—not just Prime/Select.

Section 1074g requires DoD to maintain a uniform formulary and to assure availability of formulary agents to eligible covered beneficiaries through MTF, retail, or mail order channels. Nothing in § 1074g limits that availability to Prime/Select enrollees or excludes TRICARE For Life (TFL). DoD has long articulated the “uniform” nature of the formulary; for example, the Federal Register has stated that drugs on an MTF formulary must be available to all beneficiaries (MTF context, but it reflects the uniformity principle).

The 2017 rule’s obesity language you reference is about services, not a ceiling on drugs. The carve‑out in §199.17(f)(3) sits in the managed‑care (services) section. It does not speak to, or limit, the separate pharmacy authority in § 199.21. The rule itself specifies that TFL is “unaffected by this section” (See 199.17(a)(6)(ii)(C) and is generally governed by §§199.3, 199.4, and 199.8—again underscoring that §199.17’s managed‑care enhancements don’t define the pharmacy program.

The IFR contains long standing exclusions for weight reduction services and medications—e.g., appetite suppressants and other medications used primarily for weight control. These exclusions apply across the Basic Program, not to any single plan. This is the text DoD/DHA could cite to deny coverage when a GLP 1 is prescribed solely for weight loss, but it does not support limiting GLP 1s to Prime/Select enrollees when otherwise covered under Tricare criteria. No plan specific limitation appears.

Yes, the 2017 IFR spoke in terms of “Prime/Select “when operationalizing coverage for anti obesity treatments, but, again, that limitation doesn’t come from the language of § 706 or § 729. Sections 706 and § 729 are plan neutral and speak in terms of “covered beneficiaries.” The 2017 IFR reference to Prime/Select appears to be an administrative choice, not a limitation imposed by §§ 706/729.

The proposed TFL restrictions are an effort to make a policy choice – only its not a choice they have the authority to make. They need a statute to give them that authority, and until they amend the law, they do not have it.

Bottom Line: Tricare is out of luck unless Congress acts – and I seriously doubt that will happen. This is a major FU and I plan on making sure its noted.

However, if your goal is to include GLP-1s on the uniform formulary for obesity alone, I would support that. This is a class of drugs that are very effective in addressing a host of serious illnesses. I would support making these much more widely available - Medicare/Medicaid, Affordable Care Act plans? Let's negotiate better prices and MAHA. ;-)",,N,0.0,2025-08-22 19:56:12.298727

As governments grapple with fiscal constraints and strategic priorities, the interplay between budget allocations, regulatory frameworks, and labor policies has profound implications for both operational readiness and long-term investment viability. This article examines how recent political actions—ranging from budget cuts to workforce modernization efforts—impact healthcare access and labor stability in the defense sector, offering insights for investors navigating this complex landscape.

The Dual Challenge: Labor Shortages and Healthcare Access

The defense sector faces a dual crisis: a shrinking pool of skilled labor and a declining reliance on military healthcare services. According to the 2025 Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook, over 67% of manufacturers cite talent attraction and retention as their top business challenge. This is compounded by an aging workforce, with 25% of defense sector employees nearing retirement. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense (DoD) reports that TRICARE beneficiaries using military healthcare facilities have halved over the past two decades. To address these issues, the DoD has launched a “right sizing” initiative to realign medical staffing and improve healthcare access for service members and their families.

Political decisions, however, complicate these efforts. The Trump administration's unilateral spending freezes and executive orders to delay discretionary funding—such as veterans' healthcare programs—threaten to undermine workforce stability. For instance, the FY 2025 defense budget allocates $128 billion for veterans' healthcare, yet this discretionary spending is vulnerable to impoundment or cuts if Congress fails to pass timely appropriations. Such instability risks eroding trust in the sector's ability to provide consistent care, potentially deterring talent from joining or remaining in defense roles.

Budgetary Constraints and Workforce Modernization

The FY 2025 defense budget of $849.8 billion includes targeted investments in labor stability, such as a 4.5% pay raise for service members and $2.0 billion for family housing. These measures aim to bolster retention and morale, but their effectiveness hinges on broader fiscal policies. For example, proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid—though not directly tied to defense—could ripple into the sector by reducing the availability of civilian healthcare services for military families. Similarly, the administration's push to restore impoundment powers under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act introduces uncertainty, as it may allow unilateral reductions in discretionary spending, including veterans' healthcare.

Investors must also consider how political decisions influence workforce modernization. The defense sector is increasingly adopting AI, extended reality (XR), and automation to address labor shortages. For instance, apprenticeship programs have tripled in advanced manufacturing roles since 2021, while XR is being tested to accelerate employee training. However, these innovations require sustained funding and regulatory support. If political priorities shift toward austerity, investments in digital transformation may stall, hampering the sector's ability to adapt.

Healthcare Access: A Strategic Lever for Workforce Stability

The DoD's “right sizing” initiative underscores the link between healthcare access and labor stability. By realigning medical staffing to meet current demand, the department aims to re-engage TRICARE beneficiaries and reduce reliance on external healthcare providers. This strategy aligns with global trends in healthcare, where digital tools and AI are being deployed to streamline operations and reduce clinician burnout. For example, the 2025 Deloitte global healthcare outlook highlights the role of AI in administrative efficiency—a principle the DoD could leverage to free up clinical staff for direct patient care.

Yet, political decisions may hinder progress. The administration's focus on reducing federal deficits through mandatory spending cuts—such as site-neutral payment policies for Medicare—could indirectly affect defense sector healthcare. If hospitals face reduced reimbursements, they may cut services or raise costs, limiting access for military families. Similarly, delays in veterans' healthcare funding could exacerbate wait times and reduce satisfaction, further straining workforce morale.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Opportunity

For investors, the defense sector presents both risks and opportunities. Companies that align with workforce modernization—such as those developing AI-driven training platforms or advanced manufacturing technologies—stand to benefit from long-term growth. Conversely, firms reliant on traditional labor models or vulnerable to budget cuts may face headwinds.

Key sectors to monitor include:

1. Defense Contractors with Digital Capabilities: Firms integrating AI and automation into workforce training and operations (e.g., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman).

2. Military Healthcare Providers: Companies like Humana or UnitedHealth Group, which may see increased demand if TRICARE beneficiaries return to military facilities.

3. Workforce Development Platforms: Providers of apprenticeship programs or VR/XR training tools, which are critical for addressing labor shortages.

Investors should also assess geopolitical risks. For example, the Biden Administration's National Security Strategy emphasizes a “whole-of-government” approach to workforce resilience, which could lead to increased funding for defense-related healthcare and training. Conversely, a shift toward austerity or deregulation may prioritize short-term savings over long-term stability.

Conclusion: A Call for Strategic Resilience

The defense sector's ability to navigate political decisions will determine its success in maintaining labor stability and healthcare access. While budget constraints and regulatory shifts pose challenges, they also create opportunities for innovation. Investors who prioritize companies adapting to these dynamics—through digital transformation, workforce development, or strategic partnerships—will be well-positioned to capitalize on the sector's evolution. In an era of geopolitical uncertainty, the defense sector's resilience is not just a national imperative but a compelling investment thesis.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-22 16:56:14.862427

Dear Rusty: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my health care. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years. Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Dear Retired Navy Vet:

First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (www.amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65).

For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military Tricare, you will lose your Tricare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (Tricare requires you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).

Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is there are two “parts” to Medicare - Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services) and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient health care services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your Tricare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your Social Security payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The Social Security earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your Social Security benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit before your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

Finding Mental Health Treatment in Tucson with Tricare So, will Tricare cover mental health treatment in Tucson?","AUGUST 22, 2025 – For many military families and service members living in Arizona, access to quality mental health treatment is a pressing priority.

One of the most common questions that arises is: Will Tricare cover mental health treatment in Tucson?

The short answer is yes. Tricare does provide comprehensive mental health benefits that apply to care in Tucson. However, the exact type of coverage, out-of-pocket costs, and approved providers will depend on your specific Tricare plan, eligibility, and the type of treatment needed.

In this third article in a series on behavioral health topics, MilitarySpot.com helps you understand how Tricare works in Tucson to ensure that you or your loved one can access timely and effective care without any unnecessary barriers.

How Tricare Approaches Mental Health Coverage

Tricare recognizes that mental health care is essential to overall well-being for service members, veterans, and their families. This includes coverage for a wide range of services, such as therapy, inpatient and outpatient treatment, medication management, and specialized programs for conditions like depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders.

Coverage is not limited to emergencies, Tricare supports ongoing mental health needs as well. This is an important distinction, because many families worry that insurance may only step in during a crisis. In fact, Tricare emphasizes preventive care and early intervention to improve outcomes and reduce long-term costs.

Tricare Plans and Mental Health Benefits in Tucson

Residents of Tucson may be enrolled in different Tricare programs depending on their service status and eligibility. Plans such as Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare Reserve Select, and Tricare For Life all provide varying levels of access to mental health services.

For example, Tricare Prime typically requires enrollees to get a referral from their primary care manager before starting specialty care, while Tricare Select offers more flexibility in choosing providers without referrals.

For veterans or retirees who qualify for Tricare For Life, mental health coverage works alongside Medicare. Each of these options influences how you access services in Tucson, particularly when it comes to choosing between military treatment facilities and civilian providers.

Types of Mental Health Treatment Covered by Tricare

One of the most reassuring aspects of Tricare coverage is its breadth.

Mental health services that may be covered in Tucson include individual and group therapy, family counseling, psychiatric evaluations and medication management with a licensed psychiatrist.

Inpatient hospitalization, partial hospitalization programs, residential treatment, and intensive outpatient programs, such as those offered at an accredited Tucson treatment center, are also covered.

For children and adolescents, Tricare often covers developmental or behavioral health therapies when deemed medically necessary. This comprehensive approach ensures that both acute and long-term care are available within the Tucson community.

Accessing Tricare-Covered Care in Tucson

Tucson is home to a mix of military resources and civilian treatment centers. Many Tricare beneficiaries in the area access care through Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, which offers some mental health services.

However, the base may not always meet every family’s needs, especially when specialized care or immediate access is required.

In these cases, Tricare contracts with civilian providers throughout Tucson. This means local hospitals, outpatient clinics, and private practices may all be available, as long as they are within the Tricare network.

Referral and Authorization Requirements

Understanding Tricare’s rules about referrals and authorizations can help you avoid delays in care. For beneficiaries on Tricare Prime, referrals are often required before beginning therapy with a civilian provider.

Emergency mental health situations, such as suicidal thoughts or psychiatric crises, do not require prior authorization. Tricare Select members usually have more direct access but may face higher cost-sharing responsibilities if they choose out-of-network providers.

Before starting treatment, it’s always best to confirm whether your chosen clinic or hospital in Tucson is Tricare-approved.

Court-Ordered Mental Health Treatment in Tucson

In some cases, individuals may be required by the courts to complete a mental health program as part of probation, diversion, or other legal outcomes. In Tucson, these court-ordered mental health treatments can range from counseling sessions to substance use rehabilitation, such as treatment programs offered at a Tucson mental health facility that accepts Tricare.

For military members, veterans, or dependents covered by Tricare, insurance can often be applied if the treatment itself is clinically appropriate and provided by a Tricare-authorized facility. However, there may be additional considerations, such as whether the specific program is within Tricare’s network or whether prior authorization is needed.

Families should confirm with both the court and their Tricare plan to ensure compliance with the legal order and coverage requirements. In many situations, Tricare can significantly reduce or eliminate the financial burden of mandated care, provided the services meet medical necessity criteria and are delivered by approved providers.

Cost Considerations for Families Using TriCare for Mental Health Support

Cost is a major concern for many service members and their families. Tricare generally makes mental health treatment affordable compared to private insurance. With Tricare Prime, there are often little to no copayments for in-network care.

Tricare Select requires copayments or cost-shares, which can vary based on the type of provider and service. For those receiving care at a military treatment facility in Tucson, there is typically no out-of-pocket cost. However, it is important to confirm costs before beginning treatment to avoid unexpected bills, particularly when using civilian providers.

Specialized Programs for PTSD and Trauma

Tucson has a strong network of behavioral health providers who understand the unique needs of military members and their families, especially when it comes to trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Tricare often covers evidence-based therapies for PTSD, including cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).

For veterans or active-duty members struggling with trauma, programs in Tucson can provide both individual counseling and group support, often within facilities that accept Tricare. This ensures continuity of care that addresses both mental health and the specific cultural aspects of military life.

Substance Use Treatment and Tricare Coverage

Another critical aspect of Tricare’s mental health benefits is its coverage of substance use disorder treatment. In Tucson, this can include detoxification, residential rehab, outpatient programs, and medication-assisted treatment.

Given the close link between mental health conditions and substance use, having access to integrated care through Tricare is vital. Families should know that prior authorization may be required for certain levels of care, particularly inpatient and residential programs. Still, the availability of these services under Tricare gives peace of mind to many in the Tucson military community.

Telehealth Options in Tucson

Telehealth has become a valuable option for Tricare beneficiaries, especially in areas where in-person providers may have long wait times. Tricare generally covers telehealth appointments for therapy, medication management, and psychiatric consultations.

For Tucson families, this means expanded access without the burden of commuting across the city or waiting weeks for an opening. Telehealth is especially helpful for dependents balancing school or work commitments, and for those who may not feel comfortable visiting a clinic in person.

Steps to Take if You Need Mental Health Care

If you or a loved one in Tucson needs mental health treatment, the first step is to review your Tricare plan and determine whether a referral is required. Next, identify a provider in the Tricare network using the online directory or through your primary care manager.

For emergencies, seek care immediately at the nearest hospital, Tricare will cover crisis services regardless of prior authorization. Finally, confirm any copayments or cost-shares so you can plan accordingly. These steps ensure a smoother process when starting treatment.

The Importance of Early Support

One of the strongest messages from behavioral health professionals is the importance of addressing concerns early. Waiting until symptoms worsen can make recovery more challenging.

With Tricare’s commitment to covering a full spectrum of mental health services in Tucson, families are encouraged to reach out at the first sign of difficulty. Whether it is a child struggling with anxiety, a spouse coping with depression, or a veteran dealing with trauma, timely access to care makes a significant difference.

Finding Mental Health Treatment in Tucson with Tricare

So, will Tricare cover mental health treatment in Tucson? The answer is yes, with comprehensive benefits that extend across therapy, hospitalization, medication, and specialized programs. The exact details depend on your specific Tricare plan, the type of provider you choose, and whether referrals or authorizations are required.

Tucson residents can take comfort in knowing that resources are available both on base and in the civilian community. Court-ordered treatment may also be covered when it aligns with medical necessity and is provided through an approved program, offering families both legal compliance and access to quality care.

By understanding your plan, confirming coverage, and choosing the right provider, you can access the mental health support you or your family needs with confidence. For more information about local resources and eligibility, we suggest reaching out to providers in your TriCare network (and to stay tuned for more resources from our ongoing series!)",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TRICARE-in-Tucson.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-22 11:56:26.673295

TRICARE covers certain breast pumps and supplies and breastfeeding counseling at no cost for new mothers.

“TRICARE covers these items and services for all TRICARE-eligible female beneficiaries who are at least 27 weeks pregnant,” said Jennifer Stankovic, health systems specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “It doesn’t matter what TRICARE plan you use or your sponsor’s status.”

Are you planning to adopt a baby? If you’re a female beneficiary who legally adopts and intends to personally breastfeed an infant, TRICARE will cover breastfeeding supplies and services for you.

You have options for the types of supplies and services you get and how you get them. Keep reading to learn how TRICARE covers them.

Breast pumps and supplies

TRICARE covers one manual or standard electric breast pump per birth event, including portable pumps. (To get a hospital-grade pump, you need to work with your provider and your regional contractor to get a referral and authorization.)

Here’s how to get a breast pump.

Step 1: Get a prescription.

Your prescription must be from a TRICARE-authorized doctor, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse midwife.

Your prescription must show if you’re getting a basic manual or standard electric pump.

Your prescription doesn’t have to specify a brand.

If you’re going to get a breast pump from a network provider or durable medical equipment supplier, ask your provider to include a diagnosis code on your prescription.

We suggest you make a copy of your prescription for your records.

Step 2: Get a pump.

If you don’t want to pay up front, contact your regional contractor to find a network provider or supplier. You’ll need to show your prescription. You won’t have to file a claim.

If you’re working with a military hospital or clinic to get a breast pump, follow their processes and procedures.

If you don’t mind paying up front, you can go to a TRICARE-authorized provider, supplier, or vendor. (Vendors include retail and online stores.) You won’t need to show your prescription. Be sure to save and copy your receipt so that you can file a claim for reimbursement.

You may choose to purchase a luxury or deluxe pump (meaning those with “luxury or deluxe” features, such as smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, enhanced or expanded rechargeable batteries, or unnecessary accessories). If so, you’d pay the difference between TRICARE’s maximum reimbursement for a standard breast pump and the actual cost of the pump.

Go to Breast Pumps and Supplies to learn about coverage for other supplies, where you can get breast pumps and supplies, and getting reimbursed. Contact your regional contractor for more information.

Breastfeeding counseling

TRICARE covers breastfeeding counseling in two ways:

As part of the care provided during an inpatient maternity stay, a follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or a well-child care visit

Up to six separate outpatient sessions, in addition to any breastfeeding counseling provided during an inpatient stay, follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or well-child care visit, when the counseling is:

Billed as a preventive service

The only service being provided

Provided by a TRICARE-authorized provider, outpatient hospital, or clinic. Types of TRICARE-authorized providers include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives.

Do you have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select? TRICARE’s Childbirth and Breastfeeding Demonstration gives you expanded breastfeeding counseling coverage, as noted in the TRICARE Maternity Care Brochure.

Through the CBSD, you can get outpatient breastfeeding counseling from lactation consultants and lactation counselors. These providers are highly trained, but they aren’t fully licensed medical providers.

The CBSD also covers group breastfeeding counseling.

Sessions with lactation consultants or counselors and group sessions count toward the six total allowed outpatient counseling sessions you have per birth event. You won’t pay anything out of pocket if you use a network provider.

To qualify for this extra coverage, you must:

Have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select. (Note: You aren’t eligible if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.)

Qualify for TRICARE’s breastfeeding support benefit

Do you live in the U.S.? You’re automatically enrolled in the CBSD when you or your provider submits claims covered under the CBSD. Check with your regional contractor to see if you qualify. If you have TRICARE Prime, you’ll need a referral from your primary care manager if you see a non-network provider. Point-of-service charges may apply without the referral.

Do you live overseas? You must register for the CBSD before you get any services. To register, contact the TRICARE overseas contractor.

The CBSD runs through Dec. 31, 2026. Go to Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration to learn more about CBSD eligibility, benefits, and provider types.

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for participants for a tricare.mil usability study. The DHA Usability Lab will hold several studies to get feedback on the website.

During these sessions, usability study leaders will ask participants to test out specific scenarios. Participants will have the chance to share their thoughts and feedback on the website’s:

Content

Navigation

Visuals

Layout

All studies meet remotely between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5. Each session lasts for about one hour.

The DHA Usability Lab is looking for participants from across different health plans, ages, locations, and life experiences. To participate, you must:

You don’t need to have a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate. You’ll only need to use the live version of tricare.mil.

What to expect

DHA won’t publicly share the names or information of study participants. But you’ll be asked to share your thoughts aloud with other participants on the call. The call may be recorded.

Once the study is over, the DHA Usability Lab and TRICARE communications team will analyze the results. They’ll then use this data to help shape efforts to update and redesign different parts of tricare.mil. This will enable the website to better serve military families as they navigate getting care and using their TRICARE benefit.
