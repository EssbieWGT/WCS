“TRICARE covers National Guard and Reserve members injured while in qualified duty status (under 30 days) through line of duty care,” said James Whitton, Chief, Military Medical Support Office at the Defense Health Agency. “LOD care covers treatment of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty if a LOD determination is approved.”

This article explores how, where, and under what circumstances National Guard and Reserve members can get LOD care.

How Does LOD care work?

If a National Guard or Reserve member is injured or becomes ill while on qualified duty status for 30 days or less, treatment may qualify under LOD care. This includes injury, illness, or disease that’s incurred or aggravated while on qualified duty status.

To qualify for LOD care, the injury or illness must be military-service related. LOD may also include injury or illness while traveling to or from a duty station.

What should you keep in mind?

TRICARE limits LOD treatment for a specific condition to one year from the date of your diagnosis. If you still need care after one year, you may be referred to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System.

If you have any non-service related or preexisting health conditions, they won’t be covered under LOD care unless documentation indicates that the condition was aggravated as result of military-related duty.

LOD care isn’t a government lifetime health plan.

LOD care isn’t available to family members.

Where can I get LOD care?

LOD care is available both in the U.S. and overseas. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you live.

In the U.S.:

A military hospital or clinic or the Military Medical Support Office at Defense Health Agency—Great Lakes can authorize your LOD care.

Overseas:

A military hospital or clinic or International SOS, the TRICARE Overseas contractor, can authorize your LOD care.

What happens once you get an authorization for LOD care? You can get care one of two ways:

If you live within 50 miles or one hour’s drive time of a military hospital or clinic, you must get your treatment there.

If you live remotely—more than 50 miles or one hour’s drive time from a military hospital or clinic—the MMSO will provide an authorization to the regional contractor so you can get care from a civilian provider. This includes care for both physical and mental health conditions.

These options apply in both the U.S. and overseas. However, if you’re a Reserve Component member stationed overseas:

MMSO doesn’t validate LOD status for you, except in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The TRICARE Overseas contractor can authorize your remote care from a host nation provider. They can also help you book your appointment.

Do you need emergency care or urgent care?

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. If you need urgent care, go to an appropriate urgent care facility. It’s important to know that emergency or urgent care isn’t a “one-off.” You need to meet LOD criteria, so you can get LOD urgent or emergency care without paying out of pocket.

Other tips for getting LOD care

Are you wondering what you need to get care? You’ll need to show proof of drill status, such as a muster form or Inactive Duty Training orders. This helps ensure a smooth LOD determination.

You’ll also need to ask your unit to submit DHA–GL Worksheet-01: Medical Eligibility Verification along with a unit sign-in sheet, muster form, or a copy of certified orders. Your submission must also include the urgent or emergency care medical notes. Your service unit must send this information to the MMSO as soon as possible after you get care.

Important: If you’re getting care under a LOD determination, do NOT use personal health insurance.

How do I submit LOD claims and view authorizations?

As detailed in the TRICARE Choices for National Guard and Reserve Handbook, your service Military Medical Authority determines your LOD status. However, you’ll submit claims to your regional contractor. Be sure to sign up to access your regional contractor’s secure beneficiary portal:

East Region (Humana Military)

West Region (TriWest Healthcare Alliance)

For other issues, such as primary eligibility in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System or incorrect claims processing, contact the MMSO or your military hospital or clinic:

Phone: 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676)

Email: Email the claims reprocessing Notice of Eligibility box at

dha.great-lakes.j-10.mbx.mmso-lod-misc@health.mil.

What about LOD dental care and pharmacy coverage?

What happens if you have a dental injury or illness while you’re activated for 30 days or less? You may qualify for LOD dental care. Be sure to have your service complete an LOD determination. Your commander or designated representative must sign the determination. Send it by email or mail to the dental contractor, United Concordia.

United Concordia will tell you if you’re approved and what type of treatment you’re approved for. Do you need more information? Call United Concordia:

CONUS: 866-984-2337

OCONUS: 844-653-4058

If your provider prescribes LOD-related drug for your LOD-related injury or illness, you can fill your prescription at a:

Military pharmacy

TRICARE retail network pharmacy

You won’t have any out-of-pocket expenses if you get your prescription at a military pharmacy. But you will pay upfront at a TRICARE retail network pharmacy and file a claim for reimbursement. Do you have questions about or need help filing for reimbursement? You can find detailed instructions, or call the MMSO at 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676), option 2.

What’s Happening:

Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

Details:

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

Next Steps:

If you are a long-term stockholder of Zynex, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

By Kevin Larson

The daily joy of a family meal turned into an emergency room visit, surgery, and an overnight hospital stay for retired Sergeant First Class Damien Dunn, a Soldier for Life and Winn Army Community Hospital beneficiary.

“I’m eating dinner, and I was feeling pain in my kidneys,” Dunn said. “I didn’t know what it was and I tried to let that passover, but my wife said just go to the ER.”

Dunn did the next morning, arriving at Winn’s emergency department. The healthcare team sprang into action, triaging him and charting the way ahead.

“They admitted me, ran some blood tests, ran a CT scan, then they figured out that my appendix was possibly ruptured, so I was going to have emergency surgery,” Dunn said.

Dr. Christina McCain, a general surgeon at Winn, was the doctor who performed Dunn’s appendectomy. She told him “we’re going to take care of you,” and Dunn said those words were comforting.

“I’d never had any surgeries before, but from ER into pre-op…I had full faith and confidence,” he said.

Assessing a patient’s condition quickly and determining the best treatment plan is critical, McCain said, especially in a situation like Dunn’s. Equally important, though, is establishing the rapport and trust Dunn found comforting, something McCain does with everyone she sees.

“I have always treated my patients like I would treat my own family,” she said.

After the ED prepared Dunn for the handoff, he noticed how smoothly the transition went. The teamwork between the units was remarkable.

“They moved as one cohesive unit,” he said. “They passed information from one person to another and then following up, making sure that post surgery that I was being take care of, whether taking vitals, making sure my meds are being taken care of, and checking blood pressure. They definitely have a real good team here.”

Dunn met certified registered nurse anesthesiologist Capt. Joseph Mazzarella at the pre-op area after being moved from the ED. Mazzarella and his team had been preparing to go home after reaching the end of scheduled surgeries for the day. That changed when they got word Dunn was in need of emergency surgery.

“We immediately did what we always did, go into action and get ready to go,” Mazzarella said. “We have a multidisciplinary team here at Winn to ensure the transitions from emergency room to the pre op area, to the operating room and to the inpatient care ward, are all smooth. We're a small hospital here, or community hospital, so it's very important that we all know each other. We're one team here.”

Before leaving the ED, an anesthesia teammate went to Dunn for a pre-check. Once he arrived at pre-op, Mazzarella did more checks, determining what levels of anesthesia were appropriate for Dunn factoring in specific things that came up as they talked.

“Mr. Dunn he looks like a big, tough guy, but when you talk to him, just soft, spoken, very friendly,” Mazzarella said.”He's had a 20 year experience in the army. I heard all about some of his experiences in the military, how that's affected him, and just taking that into consideration, I gave him the best care.”

The care Dunn received continued after he was discharged. McCain reached out to him, and he also took an opportunity to visit with Mazzarella. All those interactions gave him “a nice warm and fuzzy,” and built a camaraderie.

“Once a Soldier, always a Soldier,” Dunn said. “I felt like a tight knit family has been built. Moving forward, I’ll always keep that mindset, that I’ll always be taken care of, and know that my sisters and brothers will always be taken care of, whether in uniform or out of uniform.”

Knowing Winn is ready to take care of retirees like him while also ensuring the health of warfighters is reassuring to Dunn. His experience showed him the hospital goes above and beyond, not only in his case, but all beneficiaries, he said.

“I’m definitely grateful,” Dunn said. “I wouldn’t second guess coming back here for any treatments.”

With more than 30,000 Soldiers and other beneficiaries in the immediate are served by Winn, providing care for all of them ensures the Army’s lethality, Mazzarella said.

“Readiness starts with the warfighter,” he said. “Whether it’s here at Winn or downrange in an austere environment—we’re always ready to provide the best care.”

As the daughter of an Air Force veteran, McCain understands the need to provide healthcare for warfighters, retirees and families. It’s an honor to provide care at Winn, she said, both for retirees who made sacrifices for our freedoms and to keep warfighters reassured about their families’ health so they stay focused one the mission.

“They deserve exceptional care and I am humbled to be a part of this superb care team,” McCain said.

Col. Margaret Berryman, Winn director and Fort Stewart U.S. Army Medical Department Activity commander, echoed the importance of ensuring readiness by providing healthcare for the warfighters while also carrying for families and retirees like Dunn.

""Taking care of our retirees and families is a vital part of what we do,” Berryman said “It's a key part of our mission of warfighter readiness. Our Soldiers need to know their families are receiving safe, quality care so they can focus on their training and deployment. We owe our retirees this same level of commitment, honoring their service by providing them with the best healthcare.""",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Sep/26/2003809146/1920/1080/0/250916-O-TY372-3095.JPG,N,0.0,2025-09-26 23:56:42.836017

If lawmakers fail to reach a bipartisan agreement, service members may be required to fulfill their duties without pay, marking a significant shift in the lives of military families.

The implications of a government funding lapse could be far-reaching for active-duty personnel and their families. Service members risk missing their first paycheck by October 15 if negotiations don’t materialize, impacting everything from household budgets to essential services. National Guard operational drills and nonessential travel could also face interruptions.

To mitigate possible financial strain, Representative Jen Kiggans from Virginia has proposed a bipartisan bill aimed at safeguarding the paychecks of active-duty troops and reservists, including those serving in the Coast Guard. However, the bill is unlikely to come to a vote before the impending deadline, exacerbated by House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to keep the House in recess until after October 1.

Historical context underscores the critical nature of this situation; during the last government shutdown, which lasted for five weeks, many Coast Guard members experienced significant financial distress due to suspended paychecks. Although service members typically receive back pay once federal operations resume, the prospect of delayed payments, particularly concerning specialty pays and stipends, looms large.

The fate of civilian employees at the Pentagon also remains uncertain. Past experiences during government shutdowns have seen these workers either continuing without pay or facing furloughs. Recent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget suggests that potential layoffs may be considered in the event of a funding lapse.

In the realm of healthcare, essential medical and dental services within Department of Defense facilities are generally exempt from shutdown impacts. However, access to elective surgeries and procedures might be curtailed. Services provided through Tricare would continue uninterrupted.

Educational institutions run by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) are expected to remain open, although the continuation of sports and extracurricular activities hinges on nonappropriated funds. Meanwhile, child care access will vary, determined by local base staffing levels and demand.

Morale, Welfare and Recreation programs essential for maintaining operational readiness, such as mess hall services and select child care provisions, will likely persist through a shutdown. However, housing and food services generally remain operational during federal funding lapses, and military grocery stores are expected to stay open until their cash reserves are exhausted.

The historical context of the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which unfolded during President Donald Trump’s first term and lasted 35 days, serves as a cautionary tale. Past Pentagon contingency plans have indicated that certain overseas commissaries and those in remote domestic areas would continue to operate even after financial reserves are depleted, underlining the military’s commitment to ensuring that service members have access to essential resources.

As the deadline approaches, both military families and congressional leaders brace for the potentially disruptive consequences of a government shutdown, hoping for a resolution that meets the needs of all involved.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Impending-Government-Shutdown-Threatens-Military-Pay-and-Services.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-26 10:56:42.398923

Kim MacNeilly, Deputy Commander for Quality and Safety at Womack, has been awarded the DHA Patient Champion Certificate for her work at the facility.

The DHA describes the recognition as ‘a peer-to-peer recognition initiative that gives Military Health System staff an opportunity to recognize peers for their patient safety efforts,’ however MacNeilly is quick to point out that it says more about Womack than anything.

“Improvements in patient safety is a team effort, not the work of a single person,” she said. “This award recognizes the collaborative culture of learning and accountability that the entire team has built together. This recognition also affirms that our shared commitment to patient-centered care and safety are recognized and valued at our organization.”

The nomination reads “In recognition of your commitment to Patient Safety and the outstanding leadership displayed while promoting network-wide initiatives to integrate dental leaders into the six key MTF safety communication practices: demonstrating a clear understanding of a systems-based approach to quality and the importance of a fully integrated, high-reliability healthcare system. Your actions and Sensitivity to Operations approach exemplified commitment to providing Ready Reliable Care.”

“Lt. Col. MacNeilly’s recognition highlights the dedication of the entire Womack team to ensure patient safety in every interaction,” noted Col. Stephanie Mont, Commander of the Womack Army Medical Center. “Kim’s passion and commitment speak to the quality of leadership present across the hospital. We are incredibly proud of her hard work and tireless efforts to ensure that our patients receive the highest quality healthcare.”

Lt. Col. MacNeilly said the recognition came as a total surprise but even so, she is using the award to encourage others to keep up the reputation that Womack has built. “Focus on why we are here…the patients,” she said. “Every time you come to work, make it a better place for patients and for your team. Embrace continuous improvement through small, consistent efforts while also maintaining a positive, determined attitude. Lastly, focus on problem-solving and personal growth, like Aristotle’s adage, ‘Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit’, and stay proactive by not just thinking about improvements but actively implementing them.”

Bottom line, health care is messed up for everyone but for all of it’s faults Select isn’t bad

Retired and on TriCare Select since 2019. I have options close to where I live to be on and use Prime but have always stayed with Select.

I like the ability to go to any network provider for specialty care without having to jump through the referral hoops.

We made the switch to Select last year and no regerts so far. Better experience for the spouse, a few changes in copays and such, but a lot more flexibility. Fits us a bit better than Prime.

Yes. I’m retired and have TRICARE Select. It’s great.

I haven’t set foot in a military or VA medical facility in years. I was seen at a specialty clinic recently (no referral, just called and got an appointment) and had a copay of $37.

Prime is better in the long run… pays more and is cheaper in the long run… you may not always be close to the base … you’re young . I have had prime since I got out 20 years ago and never regretted it.

Depends on location really. In my case, far easier to get appointments at a facility in network vs going to Walter Reed for everything. The co-pays are whatever, it shouldn’t make that big of an impact. Select all the way.

Retired AF medic here. When I retired in 18, I kept Prime because we are close to a MTF and I already knew the lay of the land when it came to medical care where I’m at (was station in this area twice) and I needed to be sure my family would be taken care of. The MTF and outlying clinics can be frustrating at times and have been contemplating switching to Select and getting medical at my job to offset the copays and other fees. Remember that Select is Tricare’s 80/20 plan. If it can fit your needs and you can handle the increased copays, take it! More flexibility for you and your family.

Where I live, I have to use Tricare Select. It use to be free after the deductible at that time it was 300 bucks a year for the family, then a cost share of 20 percent of the allowable charge. A couple of years ago, they started charging 25 bucks a month to just be enrolled. Now it's closer to 30 bucks a month. I knew that once they started an enrollment fee, it would go up. But my family needs no authorization to see any doctor or specialist. My brother once told me it must be nice. His family plan runs over 750 a month. I told him I pre-paid my health insurance with 24 years of my life.

Tricare Select for my family in the national capital region. Pick a doctor and go, quite happy with the coverage. I have Medicare and TFL, I like that there are no more copays but don’t like the must keep Medicare to have TFL requirement, that’s a $370 bill I’d rather not have.",,N,0.0,2025-09-26 10:56:52.286621

CVS Health’s long-term care pharmacy arm, Omnicare, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following a nearly $1 billion legal judgment, putting the subsidiary and its connection with its parent company in jeopardy.

The filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas comes after a federal judge in July ordered Omnicare to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages. The case stemmed from a whistleblower lawsuit alleging that the company improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE by dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions or refills from 2010 to 2018. While CVS has argued the violations did not harm patients, the ruling created a significant liability for the business.

CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015 for $10.4 billion in cash plus $2.3 billion in debt, betting on long-term care as an important growth segment. However, the deal has been plagued with challenges, including integration hurdles and scrutiny over billing practices.

By isolating Omnicare’s liabilities in bankruptcy, CVS is attempting to contain the fallout and prevent broader impact on its core operations.

In announcing the filing, Omnicare stated that its pharmacy and clinical services will continue uninterrupted during the reorganization. The company secured $110 million in debtor-in-possession financing, subject to court approval, to support operations alongside ongoing cash flow. It also committed to maintaining wages and benefits for employees and paying vendors for obligations incurred after the bankruptcy filing.

Omnicare noted it may pursue a standalone restructuring or a sale of the business.

“The Company also intends to use this process to address other financial challenges facing the broader long-term care pharmacy industry and to evaluate its restructuring options, including the implementation of a standalone restructuring or sale strategy,” David Azzolina, president of Omnicare, said in a statement.

CVS had already previously explored a divestiture, when it sought to sell the organization in 2022 before putting its efforts on pause the following year.

The company has faced a string of legal battles and regulatory scrutiny before and after its acquisition.

In 2012, Omnicare paid nearly $50 million to settle allegations that it accepted kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for promoting certain drugs to nursing home patients. In 2014, it agreed to a $124 million settlement over claims it provided improper financial incentives to nursing homes to secure business.

In 2016, Omnicare agreed to a $28 million settlement to resolve allegations that it solicited or received kickbacks from nursing facilities. One year later, it agreed to pay $8 million to settle claims tied to improper billing of Medicare and Medicaid.

The Department of Justice then joined the whistleblower civil lawsuit in 2019, putting more pressure on CVS’ ability to keep Omnicare afloat.

Now, Omnicare’s liabilities have outweighed its strategic value to CVS, prompting the bankruptcy decision.",https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/sites/hlmp/files/files/cvs-health-building-shutterstock_1436567150_0.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-26 10:57:09.803483

Other tips for getting LOD care Are you wondering what you need to get care?","FALLS CHURCH, VA, September 25, 2025 - Are you a member of the National Guard or Reserve? If so, it’s important to know how TRICARE covers you if you become sick or are injured while activated for 30 days or less.

“TRICARE covers National Guard and Reserve members injured while in qualified duty status (under 30 days) through line of duty care,” said James Whitton, Chief, Military Medical Support Office at the Defense Health Agency. “LOD care covers treatment of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty if a LOD determination is approved.”

This article explores how, where, and under what circumstances National Guard and Reserve members can get LOD care.

How Does LOD care work?

If a National Guard or Reserve member is injured or becomes ill while on qualified duty status for 30 days or less, treatment may qualify under LOD care. This includes injury, illness, or disease that’s incurred or aggravated while on qualified duty status.

To qualify for LOD care, the injury or illness must be military-service related. LOD may also include injury or illness while traveling to or from a duty station.

What should you keep in mind?

TRICARE limits LOD treatment for a specific condition to one year from the date of your diagnosis. If you still need care after one year, you may be referred to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System.

If you have any non-service related or preexisting health conditions, they won’t be covered under LOD care unless documentation indicates that the condition was aggravated as result of military-related duty.

LOD care isn’t a government lifetime health plan.

LOD care isn’t available to family members.

Where can I get LOD care?

LOD care is available both in the U.S. and overseas. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you live.

In the U.S.:

A military hospital or clinic or the Military Medical Support Office at Defense Health Agency—Great Lakes can authorize your LOD care.

Overseas:

A military hospital or clinic or International SOS, the TRICARE Overseas contractor, can authorize your LOD care.

What happens once you get an authorization for LOD care? You can get care one of two ways:

If you live within 50 miles or one hour’s drive time of a military hospital or clinic, you must get your treatment there.

If you live remotely—more than 50 miles or one hour’s drive time from a military hospital or clinic—the MMSO will provide an authorization to the regional contractor so you can get care from a civilian provider. This includes care for both physical and mental health conditions.

These options apply in both the U.S. and overseas. However, if you’re a Reserve Component member stationed overseas:

MMSO doesn’t validate LOD status for you, except in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The TRICARE Overseas contractor can authorize your remote care from a host nation provider. They can also help you book your appointment.

Do you need emergency care or urgent care?

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. If you need urgent care, go to an appropriate urgent care facility. It’s important to know that emergency or urgent care isn’t a “one-off."" You need to meet LOD criteria, so you can get LOD urgent or emergency care without paying out of pocket.

Other tips for getting LOD care

Are you wondering what you need to get care? You’ll need to show proof of drill status, such as a muster form or Inactive Duty Training orders. This helps ensure a smooth LOD determination.

You’ll also need to ask your unit to submit DHA–GL Worksheet-01: Medical Eligibility Verification along with a unit sign-in sheet, muster form, or a copy of certified orders. Your submission must also include the urgent or emergency care medical notes. Your service unit must send this information to the MMSO as soon as possible after you get care.

Important: If you’re getting care under a LOD determination, do NOT use personal health insurance.

How do I submit LOD claims and view authorizations?

As detailed in the TRICARE Choices for National Guard and Reserve Handbook, your service Military Medical Authority determines your LOD status. However, you’ll submit claims to your regional contractor. Be sure to sign up to access your regional contractor’s secure beneficiary portal:

East Region (Humana Military)

West Region (TriWest Healthcare Alliance)

For other issues, such as primary eligibility in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System or incorrect claims processing, contact the MMSO or your military hospital or clinic:

Phone: 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676)

Email: Email the claims reprocessing Notice of Eligibility box at

dha.great-lakes.j-10.mbx.mmso-lod-misc@health.mil.

What about LOD dental care and pharmacy coverage?

What happens if you have a dental injury or illness while you’re activated for 30 days or less? You may qualify for LOD dental care. Be sure to have your service complete an LOD determination. Your commander or designated representative must sign the determination. Send it by email or mail to the dental contractor, United Concordia.

United Concordia will tell you if you’re approved and what type of treatment you’re approved for. Do you need more information? Call United Concordia:

CONUS: 866-984-2337

OCONUS: 844-653-4058

If your provider prescribes LOD-related drug for your LOD-related injury or illness, you can fill your prescription at a:

Military pharmacy

TRICARE retail network pharmacy

You won’t have any out-of-pocket expenses if you get your prescription at a military pharmacy. But you will pay upfront at a TRICARE retail network pharmacy and file a claim for reimbursement. Do you have questions about or need help filing for reimbursement? You can find detailed instructions, or call the MMSO at 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676), option 2.",https://myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil/Content/images/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-09-26 12:56:35.806554

This collaborative effort brought together logistics professionals, Senior Enlisted Hospital Corpsman, Force Surgeons, Fleet Surgical Teams, as well as other clinical leaders across the Navy including representation from, Fleet Forces Command, Naval Surface Force Pacific, Naval Surface Force Atlantic, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and Defense Health Agency, to evaluate and validate medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and consumables required to sustain operational medical readiness aboard amphibious assault platforms.

The review focused on aligning AMALs with Required Operational Capability (ROC) and Projected Operating Environment (POE) to current fleet requirements, updated clinical standards of care, and lessons learned from recent operations. By refining medical allowances, the working group ensured that shipboard medical departments remain equipped to provide comprehensive healthcare services to Sailors and Marines during deployment and combat operations.

“Large deck amphibious ships are critical assets that project power and support expeditionary forces worldwide,” said Lt. Cmdr. Telia Wright, Officer in Charge, NMRLC Det Fort Detrick. “This ensures their medical readiness directly impacts the survivability and mission effectiveness of our warfighters.”

ABA has been a covered benefit for TRICARE beneficiaries through a demonstration program in 2014. But the new report published by the National Academy of Sciences recommends ending the demonstration program and adding ABA to TRICARE as a basic benefit.

The U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Health Agency contracted with the National Academy of Sciences as part of a directive within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 to examine the Autism Care Demonstration. On Sept. 9, the National Academy of Sciences released a report that, in part, finds that applied behavior analysis clinically effective and that the policies within the Autism Care Demonstration complicated care for beneficiaries and providers.

The report pushed back on an annual report produced by the Department of Defense in 2019 that found that ABA was not effective and did not meet TRICARE’s standard for proven medical care, contrary to many interpretations of the wider experience of treatment providers and present research.

“In terms of what this does for advocacy and next steps, it’s resounding,” Mariel Fernandez, vice president of government affairs at the Council of Autism Service Providers (CASP), told Behavioral Health Business. Those next steps will include further advocacy with Congress to follow the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences report.

“It’s not going to happen overnight,” she added. “But this allows us to be able to point congressional offices to a key set of findings that then can be incorporated into the next National Defense Authorization Act as soon as possible, which will then direct the DHA to make these changes. It’s an incredible first step, but it is just a first step.”

The Council of Autism Service Providers is a nonprofit trade association and accrediting entity.

The Department of Defense has largely kept up with the idea that ABA is not effective and does not meet TRICARE standards for treatment benefits despite advocate’s and expert’s protests.

“All of our military families were making the same consistent progress that we see in their civilian counterparts, and that made us wonder how TRICARE came to such a different conclusion,” Julie Kornack, a board member for the nonprofit advocacy group National Coalition for Access to Autism Services (NCAAS), told BHB about that 2019 report. “It became clear to us that we were going to have to do something different than just going to TRICARE and asking them to understand that they weren’t using the data correctly. That’s how we ended up advocating for this [National Academies] committee to review this independently.”

Kornack is also the chief government and payer relations officer at the Center for Autism and Related Disorders (CARD). CARD is an autism therapy provider that operates 108 locations across the U.S. and is headquartered in Marco Island, Florida.

She also said that the arrival of an independent review came with some degree of trepidation for industry advocates. It wasn’t clear to what degree an independent review would ultimately weigh the findings of the Department of Defense’s assessments against existing literature.

The report presented five core findings:

— ABA is widely recognized as an effective, evidence-based treatment for autism, but it is not necessary for everyone.

— Military families face more administrative hurdles than civilians in accessing ABA, challenging access.

— Rigid documentation requirements limit providers’ ability to tailor care and challenge providers’ ability to treat TRICARE patients in the first place.

— The mandated standardized assessments don’t align with tailoring care in a heterogeneous population and provide limited use individually or across the program.

— Current restrictions prevent targeting essential life skills and limit service settings.

“ABA is extremely data-driven: every good provider is going to be able to have data that shows how every patient is benefiting from the program,” Kornack said. “We understand that [TRICARE] want to have some standardized measures to look at. There is a way to do this without creating a burden.”

On top of making ABA a basic benefit, the report recommends that TRICARE eliminate its standardized assessment requirements and allow providers to pick the right assessments for each child, encourage but not require parent training, make the use of autism service navigators by parents optional and approve all CPT codes used by the industry to track and bill for care.

Additionally, the report recommends that TRICARE establish an independent advisory council to facilitate the transition from demonstration to a basic benefit.

“I really want to reiterate again for everyone that this does not mean that the benefit is changing tomorrow. There is a lot of work that will go into getting these recommendations enacted,” Fernandez said. “The best thing that the larger ABA industry and autism service industry can do right now is just say thank you to the [National Academies] committee for their hard work, and if there’s the need for, more focused advocacy to get this done, I am sure that there will be lots of grassroots efforts in the future.”",https://bhbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/09/files-folder-report-documents-paper-research-study-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-25 16:56:22.050666

,,2025-09-25 13:36:42+00:00,Military Health System,Researchers push forward in breakthrough brain health study,"Derik Crotts, MHS Communications",,,,,https://health.mil/News/Dvids-Articles/2025/09/25/news549171,"The goal: identify early warning signs to help protect brain health for years to come.
“This work builds on years of progress,” said Ms. Kathy Lee, director of Warfighter Brain Health Policy, Office of the Secretary of War for Health Affairs.
“This research could reshape how doctors, coaches, and commanders think about brain health,” added Lee.
Instead, it’s about spotting the earliest, most subtle signs of brain change — well before disease takes hold – and promoting resilience and long-range brain health.
“This is one of the most powerful opportunities we’ve ever had to understand brain health across the lifespan,” concluded Lee.","After more than a decade of impactful work, and with the most robust and well-characterized concussion cohort ever collected, researchers in the NCAA-Department of Defense (now Department of War) Concussion Assessment, Research and Education, known as CARE, Service Academy Longitudinal mTBI Outcomes Study Integrated (CSI) Study are entering an exciting new phase — studying long-term brain health in service members and athletes. The goal: identify early warning signs to help protect brain health for years to come.

The study is testing biomarkers, or measurable signals in blood and/or imaging, that may reveal how the brain responds to concussions, repeated head impacts, and other health risk factors. These include advanced scans like MRI and PET (positron emission tomography), as well as blood-based markers that show inflammation or damage long before symptoms appear.

“This is about detecting the earliest signals — clues that may predict who is at greater risk for long-term problems, and who is more resilient,” explained Dr. Michael McCrea, co-principal investigator of the CSI Study and professor of neurosurgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin. “If we can detect changes early, we can take action early.”

The overarching goal is to combine brain scans, blood tests, genetics, and cognitive assessments into a single risk scale. A current prototype that this risk scale could be modeled from — called the Alzheimer’s Disease Relative-Risk and Resilience Scale — could identify individuals at higher risk of brain-related condition like Alzheimer’s disease, even decades before they show signs of memory loss.

To build this model, the team is analyzing imaging studies and blood samples from 500 military service members and former collegiate student athletes. Their analysis will look at more than 100 markers of various pathological processes associated with brain function and disease. Early results are expected in October 2025.

“This work builds on years of progress,” said Ms. Kathy Lee, director of Warfighter Brain Health Policy, Office of the Secretary of War for Health Affairs. “In the first phase, the CARE Consortium focused on acute injuries — studying what happens in the hours, days, and months after a concussion. Those efforts helped shape a new international framework for classifying traumatic brain injury.”

In 2025, CSI is breaking new ground by asking: What happens multiple months or years later? Can blood biomarkers, MRI scans, or genetic testing give us insights as to who may face long-term challenges?

Early results are promising. Some markers remain elevated long after an injury — suggesting they could play a role in tracking recovery and predicting outcomes.

“This research could reshape how doctors, coaches, and commanders think about brain health,” added Lee. “For service members, it may guide policies that protect and enhance readiness across a career of blast exposures and concussion. For the medical community, it could open the door to targeted treatments and prevention strategies and closer clinical follow up for those who may be at greater risk for long-term issues.”

Researchers stress that this is not about diagnosing Alzhemier’s disease in 20 year olds. Instead, it’s about spotting the earliest, most subtle signs of brain change — well before disease takes hold – and promoting resilience and long-range brain health.

“This is careful, detailed work,” added McCrea. “We’re not swinging a hammer — it’s more like we’re using tweezers. But the potential is enormous.”

With the addition and support of new partners such as Cure Alzheimer’s Fund and Bright Focus Foundation, and the backing of the DOW and the NCAA, CSI has access to a comprehensive dataset ever assembled on brain health in young adults.

“This is one of the most powerful opportunities we’ve ever had to understand brain health across the lifespan,” concluded Lee. “The findings could change the way we predict, prevent, and treat brain disease — not just in the military and athletic populations, but for society as a whole.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Biomarkers.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-25 11:56:28.639506

“Despite deployments, turnover, and new providers adjusting to military medicine, our team continues to find ways to keep patient care moving forward,” Morris said.
While the award proves success, it also highlights the weight carried by medical professionals operating at such a high pace.","VANDENBERG SPACE FORCE BASE, Calif. – The 30th Medical Group was recently awarded the Defense Health Agency’s Gold Medal for primary care productivity, a recognition that highlights the unit’s dedication to patient care and operational readiness.

The award, ranking medical groups across the Department of Defense on performance in primary care, signifies the 30th MDG’s ability to exceed demanding benchmarks. The team reached 146 percent of its productivity target, placing them at the top among their peers.

“It’s a tremendous honor and validation of our entire team’s dedication to providing exceptional care for our patients,” said Col. Joi Dozier, 30th Medical Group commander. “It shows that we’re going in the right direction, and it’s gratifying for our people to know that their hard work is being recognized.”

Lt. Col. Christine Morris, chief administrator and group practice manager, explained that the recognition is not only about numbers, but also about resilience and teamwork.

“Despite deployments, turnover, and new providers adjusting to military medicine, our team continues to find ways to keep patient care moving forward,” Morris said. “We don’t aim for the minimum — we push for the maximum, and we’ve been able to do that because of the all-in mentality across our clinics.”

Much of the healthcare demand stems from Vandenberg’s unique mission supporting West Coast rocket and test launch activities. Requiring one of the largest Security Forces squadrons in the Department of the Air Force, the installation provides extensive medical processing for deployments, readiness checks, and day-to-day care.

While the award proves success, it also highlights the weight carried by medical professionals operating at such a high pace.

According to the U.S. Surgeon General, health workers facing excessive workloads, limited rest, and administrative burdens are at increased risk for burnout — a condition that can erode morale and well-being. (hhs.gov)

Support data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that in 2022, 45.6% of health workers reported feeling burned out often or very often, compared to 32% in 2018 — underscoring how rising demands strain even the most dedicated teams. (cdc.gov)

Dozier acknowledged this challenge directly, noting that the group’s achievements were made while many providers carried workloads significantly above standard levels.

“With more providers, we could increase patient access and relieve some of the pressure on our current staff,” she said. “Our people are committed, but they need time to recharge, too. At the end of the day, burnout isn’t just about the provider — it can affect patient safety and the overall experience.”

Despite these challenges, both Dozier and Morris see the recognition as proof that the 30th MDG is moving in the right direction.

“This award tells us that our efforts are being validated, but it also motivates us to keep improving,” said Dozier. “Whether it’s exploring more virtual care options, optimizing workflows, or listening to patient feedback, we’re committed to finding ways to better serve Airmen, Guardians, and their families.”

Morris echoed the sentiment, “We’re patients here, too. Our families get care here. We understand how important it is, and that’s why we push ourselves every day to provide the best care possible.”

The 30th Medical Group’s gold medal recognition reflects not only their current success, but also their ongoing commitment to advancing patient care in the face of evolving challenges.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9338243/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-24 23:56:21.199976

Abstract

Purpose

The COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching impacts on the delivery of preventive health care to pediatric patients worldwide, including outpatient vaccination. Our study assessed the repercussions of the pandemic on the delivery of adolescent vaccines.

Methods

We utilized the TRICARE Management Activity's Military Health System (MHS) Data Repository to measure the delivery of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap), Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4), seasonal influenza (flu), and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) vaccines to adolescent children of United States (U.S.) military members during the prepandemic (March 2018–February 2020) and COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020–February 2022) periods, as well as the delivery of COVID-19 vaccine after it became available. We included those patients aged 11–21 years and eligible for TRICARE health care during these periods and indirectly measured vaccine delivery using the number of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-coded vaccinations administered per month to eligible adolescents.

Results

We found that the monthly rates of Human Papillomavirus, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, and seasonal influenza vaccination declined during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the prepandemic period. In contrast, the monthly rates of MCV4 rose during the second year of the pandemic, and MenB vaccination increased over both years. When COVID-19 vaccination was available, dependent adolescents living outside the continental United States had >2-fold higher COVID-19 vaccination rate than those living in the continental US. We also identified broadly higher vaccination rates among the adolescent children of officers as compared to the adolescent children of junior enlisted members, despite universal insurance coverage to preventive health-care services within the Military Health System.

Discussion

Adolescent vaccination rates in military dependents declined during COVID-19, especially among junior enlisted families and western regions, with slow recovery except for meningococcal vaccines.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused far-reaching disruption to the delivery of health-care services worldwide, including within the United States (U.S.) Military Health System (MHS), a complex health-care network that provides both direct care and private sector care to approximately 9.6 million TRICARE insurance beneficiaries globally. COVID-19 mitigation efforts meant to reduce the spread of the pandemic and the resource limitations created by the pandemic resulted in a decline in routine health-care visits and preventive services [1]. For pediatric patients, this meant a significant decline in well-child visits and vaccination rates [2,3]. Prior to the pandemic, military dependent children received their routine childhood vaccines at rates that approached community goals, with 74.4% completing the recommended series and only 36.2% experiencing delays in series completion [4]. However, previous research has demonstrated a significant downtrend in well-child visits and routine vaccination among US military children under 2 years of age that occurred during the pandemic [5]. Analysis from early months of the pandemic showed that the decline in U.S. vaccination rates was highest among adolescents as compared to children of 0–6 years of age [3,6], which raises concern for a similar trend among adolescent military dependent children.

In December 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a policy statement emphasizing adolescence, defined as age 11–21 years, as a critical developmental period during which a young person undergoes physical, social, emotional, and cognitive growth toward adulthood [7]. They advocate that adolescents should have a patient-centered medical home responsible for providing longitudinal preventive health-care services including developmental screening, growth and metabolic screening, counseling regarding risk-taking behaviors, and vaccination. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a periodicity schedule of annual well-visits throughout adolescence [8], which includes the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) schedule for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap), and Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4) series [9]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention further recommends seasonal influenza (flu) vaccination annually, and prior to 2025, at least one lifetime dose of COVID-19 vaccine was recommended. Other vaccines, such as Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B vaccine (MenB), are recommended to adolescent patients based on specific risk factors or shared clinical decision-making.

The continuation of annual well-child visits and preventive care through adolescence is imperative for healthy transition into adulthood, as unmet health needs in adolescence predict poor health outcomes later in life [10]. Despite this, adherence to the preventive services schedule is known to be poor during the adolescent years [11]. Teenage patients are much more likely to attend acute visits than well-child visits, and many of their acute concerns or injuries could have been avoided with appropriate preventive screening or counseling [10,11]. Adolescents are also more susceptible to several vaccine-preventable diseases based on age-related factors including social behaviors, such as intimate interpersonal relationships and large-scale social gatherings, increased risk-taking behavior, such as unprotected sexual encounters and illicit substance use, and the waning immunity of early childhood vaccines [12]. Consequently, poor adherence to or disruption of the adolescent immunization schedule can result in significant morbidity and mortality [13].

The existence of health-care disparities related to vaccination has been well-established prior to the COVID-19 pandemic [14–16]. Geography, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, parental levels of education, and health insurance inequality are all variables that can affect access to routine immunization [15–17]. In the MHS, dependent beneficiaries have universal health-care coverage through a wide-reaching network of both military and civilian health-care settings. Despite this, similar disparities in vaccination exist among the dependent children of US military members [18]. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent vaccination rates within the MHS during both the first and second years of the pandemic and to assess disparities in vaccination among unique demographic groups within the US military in order to guide targeted interventions for the groups most affected.

Methods

We performed a retrospective monthly repeated cross-sectional study using data from the MHS database of TRICARE beneficiaries. TRICARE is a health-care program of the U.S. Department of Defense MHS that provides health benefits for the US Armed Forces military members, retirees, and their dependents. The MHS records TRICARE billing data from civilian and military treatment facilities within and outside of the United States. All TRICARE-enrolled military dependents aged 11–21 years from March 2018 to February 2022 were eligible for inclusion in our study, and the number enrolled fluctuated with eligibility per given month. Patients outside of this age range were excluded. Vaccinations were queried monthly using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes corresponding to a given vaccine. We indirectly measured vaccine delivery by dividing the number of Current Procedural Terminology-coded vaccinations administered per month by the number of total patients eligible in that same month to calculate the monthly vaccination rates.

Demographic subgroups for our study included sex, age, geographic location, and military sponsor rank. Sponsor rank was categorized as junior enlisted (E1-E4), senior enlisted (E5-E9), or officer rank (O1-O10). Military rank is a useful proxy for educational attainment and socioeconomic status, with junior enlisted rank generally indicating a lower income and lower level of educational attainment [19,20]. Officers, in contrast, must have a college degree and earn a significantly higher base salary. Geographic regions were defined based on TRICARE's classification of North, South, West, and outside of the continental United States (OCONUS) at the time of the study period. The study time periods were defined as pre–COVID-19 (March 2018–February 2020), first COVID-19 pandemic year (March 2020–February 2021), and second COVID-19 pandemic year (March 2021–February 2022). We compared median monthly vaccination rates across prepandemic and COVID-19 pandemic time periods, as well as between demographic groups. We then used adjusted Poisson regression to create rate ratios for vaccination rates according to age, sex, sponsor rank, and geographic location.

Results

A total of 1,497,173 unique adolescent patients were enrolled in this study with a median monthly enrollment of 967,933 (Table 1). The median age at first month of inclusion was 15 [interquartile range (IQR) 11–18], 53.9% were female, 13.9% were dependents of junior enlisted service members (E1–E4), 63.0% of senior enlisted (E5–E9), and 23.1% of officers (O1–O10). Geographic breakdowns resulted in 31.5% residing in the North, 34.1% in the South, and 28.9% in the West, and 5.6% OCONUS. Among the routine adolescent vaccine series, 244,297 patients received HPV, 124,970 received Tdap, and 299,328 received MCV4. MenB was administered to 57,257 patients. The study period included four iterations of the seasonal influenza vaccine, with patients receiving 461,580 total flu vaccines. For the COVID-19 vaccine, which was not authorized for use in adolescents aged 12–17 years until January of 2022, study patients received 103,854 vaccines throughout the months they were eligible.

The first year of the pandemic saw a decline in the vaccination rate for all routine adolescent vaccine series and MenB, with the steepest decline occurring at the beginning of the pandemic (Figure 1). For HPV and Tdap, the monthly vaccination rates were, respectively, 19% and 21% lower during the first year of the pandemic as compared to the prepandemic period and then began to recover during the second pandemic year but did not return to prepandemic levels (Figure 1). Monthly vaccination rates with MCV4 saw a similar decline of 12% during the first pandemic year but then recovered during the second pandemic year to a rate of 4% higher than prepandemic. Over the four iterations of seasonal flu vaccination encompassed in the study, there was a sustained downtrend in the peak monthly flu vaccination rate for each flu season (Figure 1). In contrast, monthly vaccination with MenB did not decline during the first year of the pandemic, and it increased by 12% during the second pandemic year (Figure 1).

Examining the demographic groups, males were significantly less likely to receive the HPV, seasonal flu, and MenB vaccines but more likely to receive the MCV4 and COVID-19 vaccines (Tables 2 and 3). The adolescent dependents of officers and senior enlisted members were significantly more likely to receive all of the vaccines studied except Tdap. Notably, the dependents of officers were over four times more likely to receive MenB than the dependents of junior enlisted members. Geographically, TRICARE's North region had the highest vaccination rates for HPV, MCV4, and MenB. The OCONUS region had the highest rates for Tdap, flu, and COVID-19 vaccines, and OCONUS dependents were over twice as likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to their continental peers.

Discussion

This study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vaccination rates for adolescent patients within the MHS and identified a significant decline in vaccination rates for several routine vaccine series, as well as the seasonal flu vaccine. The steepest decline occurred during March–April 2020, coinciding with the initial mandated lockdowns and social distancing efforts. Despite health-care systems slowly returning to normal capabilities over the following years, for the majority of the vaccines we studied, vaccination rates did not recover to prepandemic rates. We also identified significant disparities in vaccination rates affecting the junior enlisted population and western TRICARE region.

Considering the social, economic, and geopolitical disruption that occurred over the first year of the pandemic, the initial decline followed by the slow recovery of vaccination rates during this year is not unexpected. However, the failure of the rates of HPV and Tdap vaccination to recover by the end of the second pandemic year is concerning, especially considering the broad “reopening” that had occurred by the end of our study period. Prior to the pandemic, school vaccination requirements at the state and local levels were an effective tool for maximizing vaccination rates [21]. In 2019, Tdap was required for later grade school entry in all 50 states, MCV4 was required in 30 states, and HPV was required in three states [22,23]. This is applicable to US military dependents, as military duty stations are present within all 50 states, and 77% of military dependent children are enrolled in local public or private schools K-12 [24]. The Department of Defense Education Activity, the U.S. military-affiliated school system that enrolls military children worldwide, requires vaccination with Tdap, MCV4, and seasonal flu [25]. The transition to remote school modalities may have contributed significantly to the slow recovery in rates during our study period, though it remains unclear why the trends were not consistent among the three routine vaccine series.

A rise in vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic also could have affected the uptake of several of the vaccines we studied. Prior to the pandemic, HPV was the adolescent vaccine series with the most associated hesitancy due to concerns that it caused infertility, autoimmune conditions, or promoted sexual promiscuity in adolescent girls [26]. Historically, it had lower rates of uptake as compared to other routine vaccines [26]. During the pandemic, the roll out of the novel COVID-19 vaccine was met with widespread concerns about safety and efficacy [27]. There was an associated increase in hesitancy regarding vaccination in general [27], which may have contributed to the decreased rates of Tdap and worsened the already lower comparative rates of HPV vaccination. The progressive decline in peak seasonal flu vaccination may also be reflective of growing vaccine hesitancy; though with social distancing efforts in place and low rates of influenza circulating in the community [28], there was also less incentive to be immunized. In the wake of the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy has persisted, and the topic of vaccination has become increasingly political [29], compounding the global health debt incurred during the pandemic and worsening the risk of vaccine-preventable illness outbreaks.

Despite the barriers to vaccination detailed above, both meningitis vaccines surpassed their prepandemic delivery rates during our study period. It is remarkable that MenB administration rose during the first year of the pandemic, as this was not observed for any of the routine vaccine series or the flu vaccine. One likely contributor to the recovery of MCV4 and the sustained rise in MenB rates is that colleges commonly require these for enrollment or on-campus housing. Currently, there are 22 state university systems that require meningococcal vaccination in order to live in campus housing [30]. In contrast, Tdap is only required by university systems in 13 states, and HPV is not required by higher education in any state. Though MenB is not universally recommended for all adolescents, a series of meningitis B outbreaks between 2013 and 2019 [31] has spurred an increase in the number of universities requiring or recommending MenB [32]. If college requirements buoyed meningococcal vaccination during the pandemic, it is noteworthy that the adolescent dependents of officers were four times more likely to receive MenB than the dependents of junior enlisted members, suggesting a higher rate of college enrollment. This is also consistent with previous observations that military rank is a reliable surrogate for income and educational attainment [19,20].

The military is a diverse institution whose members reflect the demographics of the United States [33], but our study population is unique in that all active duty service members and their dependents have access to the same health-care system through TRICARE. Despite universal insurance coverage, recent research demonstrated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the largest declines in vaccination rates for children under 24 months of age occurred among the dependents of junior enlisted parents and those living in the western United States or outside the continental United States [5]. We found similar disparities in our adolescent cohort. Dependents of officers and senior enlisted members were more likely to get all of the vaccines we studied, with the exception of Tdap. Potential explanations may be due to educational gaps between these groups or differences in where these groups obtain their health information. Junior enlisted rank typically denotes younger age, and they are therefore less likely to have adolescent-aged children, so the children of officers and senior enlisted members comprised a larger percentage of beneficiaries studied.

Our study also saw regional variations in vaccine delivery, which may be tied to regional policies regarding social distancing and reopening. Notably, dependents living in the north were more likely to receive their routine vaccine series than those living in the south or west. Western regions also were less likely to receive influenza, MenB, and COVID-19 than northern regions. The generally lower rates of vaccination in the west may be related to the longer and more rigorously enforced social distancing mandates in western states. The OCONUS region saw notably higher rates of COVID-19 and flu vaccination, which is likely because health policies are more enforceable for military dependents living overseas than within the continental United States. The dependents of military members transferring OCONUS undergo an Overseas Suitability Screening to ensure that their medical, dental, and developmental health needs can be met by the assigned duty station, which includes a review of immunization status. Military dependents living at most OCONUS duty stations are also subjected to host nation entry requirements and health policies.

A significant strength of our study is the large population, which was geographically widespread with racial and income diversity reflective of the US population. Our population was also universally insured with access to medical treatment facilities, which mitigates the effect of insurance bias on vaccination rates but also limits the generalizability. Our methodology using Current Procedural Terminology coding yields reliable indirect measurements of vaccination rates but does not capture any vaccinations that were not billed under TRICARE insurance. It is possible that military children were immunized using secondary insurance of a nonmilitary family member, or through public health vaccine initiatives, which our study does not capture. We were also unable to assess vaccination rates at an individual level, including the completion of the vaccination series by a given dependent. We did not assess the age of the dependents as related to sponsor rank, so there is room for misinterpretation of vaccination rates by rank as mentioned above. Lastly, some of the patients in our cohort may have received their HPV vaccine at age of 9 or 10 years, in accordance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations [34], and therefore would not have been captured in our study. However, this recommendation for earlier administration was released in 2016, prior to our study, and we would not expect a significant change in rates of 9-year-old and 10-year-old patients vaccinated to change over the time of our study. Therefore, it is unlikely to have significantly impacted our observed HPV delivery rates.

Conclusion

Vaccination rates for adolescent US military children decreased substantially in the first months of the pandemic, with the exception of meningococcal vaccines that did not recover to prepandemic rates over the next 2 years. Decreases in vaccination were especially notable in dependents of junior enlisted members and those living in the western TRICARE region. Therefore, it is imperative to explore ways of removing barriers to vaccination, including attitudes toward vaccine safety and efficacy, financial and educational gaps, geographic differences in health policy, and any other factors that could compromise the delivery of preventative care to our military pediatric population.
