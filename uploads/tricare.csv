Bill S. 2239, titled the ""Improving Access to Prenatal Care for Military Families Act,"" proposes the establishment of a pilot program by the Department of Defense to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event for enrollment in TRICARE Select. This legislative proposal aims to facilitate better access to health care services for military families by offering an inclusive framework for enrollment driven by the occurrence of pregnancy.

[b]Main Focus and Key Objectives[/b]

The central objective of the Bill is to provide a mechanism that allows eligible beneficiaries to enroll in TRICARE Select during pregnancy, categorized as a qualifying event. The proposal underlines the need to adapt healthcare benefits to the specific needs of military personnel and their families, thus enhancing prenatal care access. The Bill signifies a commitment to supporting military families by recognizing pregnancy as an important trigger for healthcare enrollment adjustments.

[b]Pilot Program Establishment[/b]

The Bill mandates the commencement of a five-year pilot program not later than 180 days after its enactment. Under this program, the Secretary of Defense is instructed to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event as outlined in section 1099(b)(1)(B) of Title 10, United States Code. This provision applies to TRICARE Select enrollment by an eligible beneficiary, aiming to streamline and facilitate access to necessary prenatal healthcare services.

[b]Initial Briefing and Reporting Requirements[/b]

Within one year after enacting the Bill, the Secretary of Defense is required to deliver a briefing to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the status of the pilot program. This ensures continuous oversight and evaluation of the program's implementation and efficacy. Subsequently, an annual report is mandated, with the first submission due one year after the program's commencement. These reports will provide data on enrollment changes influenced by the pilot program, with disaggregated statistics by month and specific circumstances leading to such changes, including pregnancy as a qualifying event.

[b]Definitions and Relevant Terms[/b]

The Bill includes clear definitions of terms vital to the understanding and implementation of its provisions. ""Active duty"" follows the meaning set forth in section 101(d) of Title 10, United States Code. ""Appropriate congressional committees"" encompass the Committee on Armed Services of both the Senate and House, in addition to other relevant committees in the House of Representatives. The terms ""covered enrollment change,"" ""dependent,"" ""TRICARE Select,"" ""eligible beneficiary,"" and ""uniformed services"" are also defined according to the United States Code.

[b]Noteworthy Provisions[/b]

A significant aspect of the Bill is its emphasis on treating pregnancy as a notable qualifying event for health coverage adjustments, addressing potential barriers to timely access to prenatal care for the military community. The proposed pilot program serves as both an innovative and responsive measure to the unique demands faced by those serving in the armed forces and their dependents. Through systematic reporting and oversight, the Bill ensures that informed decisions are made regarding the future of such healthcare initiatives.

This Bill engages actively with the need to improve health care accessibility for military families, placing particular importance on adaptability to personal circumstances like pregnancy, thus reflecting a comprehensive approach to personnel welfare and family support within the military framework....",Not Available,"https://4a4c3a29ba9d1a23d3f6651fb46d2f54.cdn.bubble.io/cdn-cgi/image/w=,h=,f=auto,dpr=1,fit=contain/f1708896951335x142739689930226020/CodifyLogo1.png",N,0.0,2025-09-08 12:56:15.493741

There is increasing evidence on regional variations in U.S. Medicare utilization based on older patients who move. Yet evidence is limited for younger ages in the U.S., and movers may differ systematically from those who don’t move. In this paper, we harness the mandatory migration of military personnel and dependents (age 5 to 64) to estimate supply and demand factors in a system of care in which military physicians are salaried and copayments and deductibles are negligible. In our sample of 3 million enrollees, we find that place or supply effects explain as much as 80 percent of the overall regional variation for both the entire sample and for active-duty personnel. These regional place effects are correlated across age groups, with correlations as high as 0.84 between middle-aged and older military enrollees.

He emphasized the importance of delivering high-quality medical care to those who we serve.

“We’re here to support the warfighter, and I don’t think there’s a place that could embody that more than Fort Bragg,” said Ferrara. Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. military installations in the world with more than 50,000 service members assigned.

As the principal medical advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. Since his appointment to his position on Jan. 20, he has been visiting and touring military medical facilities to collect firsthand feedback to understand local issues and successes, which helps him advocate for the staff and resources needed.

During the visit, he met with key leaders, department chiefs and toured various medical units to gain a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of WAMC’s mission and the challenges faced by health care providers in the field. Ferrara also presented coins to several individuals who have played a vital role in WAMC’s success, recognizing their dedication and hard work.

At a town hall with Womack staff, he emphasized that one of the most important parts of his job is being the voice of healthcare providers and personnel.

“What makes the Military Health System unique is there are many great health care systems in America, but we’re the only American healthcare system that goes to war,” he said. This means a high level of readiness is required for medical forces supporting both deployed personnel and their families with high-quality care.

“I’m your voice,” Ferrara said. “When I’m advising up, its essential to have that kind of understanding, to hear from people that do the work. The reason we're doing all that is not only to help our beneficiaries by taking care of them, but it's to maintain our readiness.”

Ferrara also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. “We’re working together more closely than ever before, and that’s going to lead to better care for our veterans and our beneficiaries.”

“By taking care of veterans, we’re not only improving their health outcomes, but were also improving readiness and generating revenue for our military treatment facilities,” Ferrara explained.

The Military Health System is committed to delivering high-quality medical care to warfighters and their families ensuring their wellbeing and supporting their service.

This latest move by Congress comes in response to repeated reports of delayed payments, ongoing operational and access issues, and patient care disruptions. The House Armed Services Committee has included language in a new report that could trigger deeper federal oversight.

As reported in a June article, APTA has been steadfast in its efforts to bring attention to some of these severe disruptions from TRICARE T-5, which began on Jan. 1 and is the fifth generation of TRICARE Managed Support Contracts. Since the start of 2025, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as the Managed Care Support Contractor and the West region took on seven additional states, these disruptions have continued to wreak havoc on TRICARE beneficiaries and providers.

In July, APTA signed onto joint letters to both the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, citing the following critical issues:

The crisis within the TRICARE system is jeopardizing the health and stability of veterans, service members, and their families.

Critical data transfer failure, rooted in flawed software implementation and deployment of an inaccurate database on a live platform, has inflicted immeasurable damage upon providers and patients with no end point or solution.

Beneficiaries and health care providers are grappling with unprecedented barriers to accessing care.

In its new report accompanying the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the House Armed Services Committee has included provisions requiring detailed reviews of TRICARE claim processing delays and the implementation of a study to investigate the Department of Defense’s Military Health System's new TRICARE T-5 contract.

The provisions call on the Department of Defense to submit two comprehensive reports to Congress by March 31, 2026. These reports will examine:

The root causes of TRICARE claim and payment delays, including contractor transitions, staffing shortages, and system inefficiencies

The number of affected providers and beneficiaries, including disruptions in care, delayed authorizations, and access

Performance metrics like average claim processing times and payment timelines broken out by region and contractor

The reasons health providers left the TRICARE network

The full scope and impact of the T-5 contract implementation in TRICARE East and West regions

You can read the full House NDAA report language here.

Calling APTA members who treat TRICARE beneficiaries: If you're still experiencing delays or challenges with TRICARE, we want to hear from you and assist you in your advocacy. Please contact APTA Advocacy for assistance.
