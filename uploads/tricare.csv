""I want both visitors and residents to understand that when they dine in South Carolina, they're not just enjoying a meal. They're experiencing a living heritage,” said Chef Guichard Ulysse.

Military construction, including facilities that support readiness and quality of life across military installations.

The Department of Commerce, which includes the NOAA Commissioned Corps.

[TAKE ACTION: Protect Servicemember Pay During Any Future Shutdown]

Communities Still Operating Under Temporary Funding

Other major parts of the uniformed services community are still operating under a continuing resolution (CR) because their FY 2026 appropriations bills have not been enacted.

These include:

The Department of War, which includes active duty military servicemembers, the National Guard and Reserve, and the civilian workforce responsible for supporting their readiness, training, and operations.

The Coast Guard, including pay, operations, and mission execution for Coast Guard personnel (operating under the Department of Homeland Security).

The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), whose commissioned officers support public health readiness and federal response missions (Operating under the Department of Health and Human Services).

Until full-year appropriations are enacted, these service communities remain subject to temporary funding tied to the Jan. 30 deadline.

MOAA’s Position and Mission

While continuing resolutions keep agencies operating in the short term, they do not provide the certainty or flexibility of full-year appropriations. Delays in completing the FY 2026 budget extend uncertainty for servicemembers, veterans, families, and the civilian workforce that supports the all-volunteer force — even as missions and commitments continue uninterrupted.

That is why legislation like the Shutdown Fairness Act is vital for protecting service-earned pay and benefits. It will ensure that members of the armed services, to include the reserve component, are paid during any future lapse in appropriations. Unfortunately, as written, the bill does not explicitly include members of the USPHS Commissioned Corps or the NOAA Commissioned Corps; MOAA is advocating for their addition before the bill moves to a vote.

TRICARE Pharmacy copays are outlined in federal statute. Congress provided the authority to reduce copays for TRICARE Prime Remote in the FY 2025 National Defense Authorization Act – the intent is to provide military families stationed remotely with zero-cost prescription medications similar to what is available to active duty families with access to a military treatment facility pharmacy.

TRICARE Prime Remote beneficiaries are still subject to TRICARE Pharmacy Program coverage policies. The Jan. 27 announcement included reminders about other steps eligible beneficiaries may need to take to avoid out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications:

Those using non-formulary drugs must secure approval from Express Scripts before filling the prescription. Otherwise, the beneficiary will be responsible for the full cost of the medication.

Those taking certain maintenance drugs must secure refills via home delivery to avoid paying full price for the medication. TRICARE will pay for only two refills obtained at a retail pharmacy.

Medical necessity and prior authorization requirements remain in place for TRICARE to cover any prescription costs.

Blood replacement therapies are a top-tier priority for the Joint Services and U.S. Combatant Commands. FDP, managed by the Defense Health Agency’s Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office, is a shelf-stable plasma designed for use in far-forward environments, potentially saving lives during future conflicts by enabling quicker access to this vital resource while simultaneously easing the logistical burden of transporting traditional blood products. OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care Project Management team, in partnership with stakeholders across the Department of War and development industry, have worked to increase commercial availability of FDP during the past several years to fill critical capability gaps for frontline medical providers as they prepare for future conflicts in remote, austere environments like the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions of the globe. As part of DHA, OPMED partners with stakeholders across the Joint Force to develop, acquire, and field medical devices, treatments, and frontline care solutions for military medical providers to fill capability gaps with the speed of relevance.

The battlefield of tomorrow demands medical innovations today, and within the Defense Health Agency, the Warfighter Protection and Acute Care project management office is at the forefront of this critical mission. Part of the Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office, WPAC is laser-focused on delivering medical solutions that empower warfighters to operate with confidence, even in the most austere and high-risk environments.

A significant thrust of WPAC’s efforts centers on delivering blood products to fill existing capability gaps for frontline providers across the Department of War. Recognizing that early transfusions of blood and blood components dramatically improve survival rates, WPAC is championing the development of easily deployable and shelf-stable blood treatments.

Freeze-Dried Plasma is a prime example. Plasma, blood’s liquid component, carries proteins that aid in blood clotting. It is vital to controlling and treating both external and internal blood loss caused by combat trauma. While lifesaving treatments for use at the front lines have increased survival rates exponentially since WWII, uncontrolled blood loss is the greatest determining factor when time and distance impede evacuation to higher levels of care.

FDP is a shelf-stable plasma designed for use in far-forward environments, potentially saving lives during future conflicts by enabling quicker access to this vital resource while simultaneously easing the logistical burden of transporting traditional blood products.

While FDP was initially developed as a U.S. Army program, the WPAC team has broadened the scope of its work to support the Joint Force. Following the realignment of OPMED under the Defense Health Agency in 2024, WPAC has been collaborating with stakeholders across the DoW to better meet the needs of each military branch and Combatant Command. Blood products remain at the top of the list of urgently needed solutions as warfighters continue to prepare for conflicts across the world, according to Lindsey Garver, Ph.D., WPAC’s deputy project manager.

“This process involved several big strategic meetings with key stakeholders to plan a concept of operations and determine quantities to meet the current and future needs of the service branches, Special Forces, and Combatant Commands,” said Garver.

In 2024, WPAC’s commercial partner, Octapharma USA, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for its octaplasLG powder for use when no other blood replacement therapy is available during military operations. In addition to developing this interim solution, Garver noted, the WPAC team provided direct support to its military stakeholders over the past year to refine processes and strengthen lines of communication.

“To my knowledge, [FDP] is the first OPMED program requiring this level of coordination across so many organizations,” Garver said. “The validation of FDP as a solution to meet the needs of the Joint Force while partnering closely with end-user commands is really a testament to the importance of WPAC and OPMED as a force-enabler for frontline warfighters.”

FDP is a cost-effective, efficient, expeditionary solution to mitigate the challenges of time and distance found in places like the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions of the globe, according to Andy Atkinson, the FDP product manager with WPAC.

“Blood products are a critical and urgent need across the [Department of War] and the service branches, and FDP is a game-changer to fill capability gaps at the front line,” said Atkinson. “Our focus has always been to enhance warfighter readiness and to provide a solution for military medical providers that works across the spectrum of conflict.

“FDP, because it is so user-friendly, portable, cost-effective, and shelf stable, is form-fitted for use by both conventional and special forces literally anywhere in the world,” he added. “[Blood products like FDP] are both urgently needed and in line with what our Joint Force partners need to save lives during future conflicts.”

The fix would eliminate the patient responsibility for a network facility fee copay in addition to the copay for an outpatient office visit. After the transition to a new TRICARE claims processor on Jan. 1, 2025, some beneficiaries were mistakenly charged both copays.

Thanks to beneficiaries who shared their explanation of benefits (EOB) documents with MOAA, we were able to verify this claims processing issue and escalate it to the TRICARE contractors for resolution. Inaccurate claims are being reprocessed to reflect $0 patient responsibility for the network facility fee in conjunction with a network outpatient visit.

Hospitals are allowed to charge patients a facility fee (on top of the charges for medical services) to help cover the high cost of running a hospital. Patients sometimes encounter facility fees when they receive outpatient care from a provider office attached to a hospital or medical center.

As hospitals buy up physician practices, urgent care centers, walk-in clinics, and standalone surgery centers, patients are more likely to encounter a facility fee even when they receive care outside the hospital setting.

The TRICARE copay construct, implemented in January 2018, rolled facility fees into the copay calculation for network outpatient visits. When a beneficiary has an outpatient visit, and both the provider and facility are in-network, the patient is responsible for only one copay for the office visit – there should be no copay for the facility fee.

[RELATED: Retired Naval Officer Takes Helm of Military Health Care]

Families with recurring medical appointments noticed the change – for specialty visits that include facility fees, Group A retiree families on TRICARE Select saw their out-of-pocket costs increase from $51 per visit to $102 with the addition of the facility fee copay.

Impacted claims are being reprocessed, and beneficiaries should expect to receive new EOBs for those visits that indicate $0 patient responsibility for the facility fee charge.

Please note that if the provider is non-network or the facility is non-network, the patient is responsible for a copay for the network portion of the visit and a percent cost share for the non-network portion of the visit.

Once TRICARE reprocesses claims, medical provider billing offices may proactively apply an account credit or send a refund if the patient already paid the mistaken facility fee copay. Alternatively, impacted patients can contact the provider’s billing office to request a refund – be sure to provide a copy of the revised EOB that shows the $0 patient responsibility for the facility fee.

“Now, active duty family members living far from a military hospital or clinic and enrolled in TPR won’t pay copayments for covered drugs,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Teisha Robertson, Chief, Pharmacy Integration Branch at the Defense Health Agency. “This change will help military families without access to military pharmacies keep their pharmacy costs down.”

Non-formulary drugs

Are you filling a non-formulary drug? You’ll need to get a medical necessity approval from Express Scripts. If you don’t get this medical necessity approval, you’ll need to fill the prescription at a retail pharmacy. You’ll be responsible for the full cost of the drug.

Do you take certain maintenance drugs? You’re still required to refill them through home delivery. (You can fill these prescriptions at a retail network pharmacy twice. But the third time, you’ll be responsible for 100% of the drug’s cost, as detailed in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook.)

Note: If you fill a non-covered drug, you’re responsible for the full cost. Other pharmacy rules, such as prior authorization requirements and medical necessity requirements, remain in place.

FALLS CHURCH, Virginia – The Defense Health Agency announced that TRICARE beneficiaries in New York may receive emergency prescription refills now through Feb. 2, due to severe weather.

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather/2026-jan-23/state-emergency-alert-severe-weather-kentucky page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families.

The Joint Commission is the nation’s oldest and largest accrediting body, evaluating health care organizations to promote continuous improvement and patient safety.
“Joint Commission standards provide the foundation for a proactive approach to patient safety,” Hall said.
“The principles behind Joint Commission accreditation emphasize leadership engagement, continuous improvement, and a strong culture of safety,” Hall said.
“Earning Joint Commission accreditation again shows that we care — about our patients, our staff, and our community,” Moore said.","FORT POLK, La. — Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital has once again earned The Joint Commission’s Gold Seal of Approval®, reaffirming the hospital’s commitment to delivering safe, high-quality care to Soldiers, Families, and the Fort Polk community.

The Gold Seal of Approval is a nationally and internationally recognized symbol of quality that reflects a health care organization’s compliance with The Joint Commission’s rigorous performance standards. BJACH underwent a comprehensive on-site evaluation that examined patient care, clinical processes, safety practices, and organizational performance.

The Joint Commission is the nation’s oldest and largest accrediting body, evaluating health care organizations to promote continuous improvement and patient safety.

“This accreditation is an objective evaluation of our hospital’s performance,” said Ria Moore, a registered nurse and The Joint Commission coordinator for BJACH. “It demonstrates our unwavering commitment to providing safe, high-quality care to every patient. More importantly, it shows that quality and safety are not something we focus on only during a survey — they are part of what we do every day.”

BJACH is surveyed every three years; however, hospital leaders emphasize that quality and patient safety are sustained year-round. Accreditation standards are embedded into daily operations across inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and administrative departments.

“To ensure continuous improvement, we’ve moved away from infrequent, paper-based exercises and toward a more automated, user-friendly approach,” Moore said. “We conduct regular patient-care reviews that follow care processes across departments, review data consistently, and address any breakdowns in care as they occur. This creates a culture where quality is everyone’s responsibility.”

Stacy Hall, a registered nurse and chief of clinical quality management for BJACH, said Joint Commission accreditation strengthens patient safety and risk management by reinforcing evidence-based practices throughout the hospital.

“Joint Commission standards provide the foundation for a proactive approach to patient safety,” Hall said. “They guide how we implement clinical practice guidelines, measure performance, and improve outcomes. By adhering to these standards, we promote consistent, high-quality care, stronger teamwork, and a safer environment for both patients and staff.”

Hall added that accreditation aligns with the Defense Health Agency’s focus on high-reliability health care and supports BJACH’s mission.

“The principles behind Joint Commission accreditation emphasize leadership engagement, continuous improvement, and a strong culture of safety,” Hall said. “Those principles guide how we care for our patients and support our staff every day.”

Col. Patrick W. Miller, hospital commander, said the achievement reflects BJACH’s values and the culture the team works to uphold every day.

“This accreditation is a testament to the professionalism and teamwork of our BJACH staff,” Miller said. “It reflects a culture rooted in caring for our patients, supporting one another, and remaining committed to providing safe, high-quality care for the Soldiers, Families, and community we serve.”

For patients and Families, the Gold Seal of Approval offers reassurance.

“When patients see the Gold Seal, they can be confident that BJACH has voluntarily undergone a rigorous evaluation and met the highest standards of care,” Moore said. “It reflects our promise to continually improve and to provide the best possible care to those who trust us with their health.”

Hospital leaders emphasized that accreditation is not simply about passing an inspection, but about accountability, transparency, and sustained excellence.

“Earning Joint Commission accreditation again shows that we care — about our patients, our staff, and our community,” Moore said. “We want to be better tomorrow than we were today.”",,N,0.0,2026-01-27 11:56:57.538471

Earlier this month, House Republicans launched an investigation into Omar’s finances.

The probe, first reported by the New York Post, is about how Omar’s household assets increased by a large amount during her time in office.

The Post said the lawyers are looking into on how Omar and her husband Tim Mynett ""went from nearly broke to being worth up to $30 million in just a year,"" citing disclosure documents from 2024.

Last month, Omar denied reports that she was a millionaire.

The department’s move follows the Pentagon’s decision to discontinue a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen and other firms.
“Booz Allen has zero tolerance for violations of the law and operates under the highest ethical and professional guidelines.
When Littlejohn’s criminal conduct occurred more than five years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems.
“Booz Allen fully supported the U.S. government in its investigation, and the government expressed gratitude for our assistance, which led to Littlejohn’s prosecution.","The Treasury Department on Monday said it would cancel 31 contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, citing its failure to ” implement adequate safeguards” after a past employee leaked tax data, including President Trump’s returns, to media outlets.

The decision to cut ties with the company was due in part to the misconduct of Charles Edward Littlejohn, who stole and leaked the confidential tax returns of some of the country’s wealthiest people, ultimately impacting 406,000 taxpayers, the Treasury Department said in a release announcing the cancellations.

Littlejohn is a former IRS contractor who provided data to The New York Times and ProPublica from 2018-20, after figuring out how to extract tax data without raising internal flags. He was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking tax information.

“Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the statement.

Littlejohn disclosed more than a decade of tax returns for thousands of people, including Trump, whom the outlets said paid $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017.

In total, the Booz Allen contracts were valued in $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in obligations, according to the Treasury.

The department’s move follows the Pentagon’s decision to discontinue a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen and other firms.

Still, the company said it was “surprised” by the Treasury’s announcement to cancel all of its contracts.

“Booz Allen has zero tolerance for violations of the law and operates under the highest ethical and professional guidelines. When Littlejohn’s criminal conduct occurred more than five years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems. Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks,” a company spokesperson told The Hill.

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr.
The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.
Capturing the patient experience PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments.
The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels.","The Defense Health Agency implemented a new system for patient advocates to track and manage patient feedback across the Military Health System.

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr. Gabrielle Crane, chief of the patient experience branch at DHA.

The primary goal of PAART is to use patient feedback provided to drive improvements within military hospitals and clinics, Crane said. The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.

""It's standardized and consistent,"" she explained. ""The old process was fragmented within each MTF, and patient advocates had differing processes for how they managed feedback. The new system is exciting because now it will be streamlined and provide transparency enterprise-wide.""

For military hospital and clinic leadership, PAART will provide data across the MHS and make better decisions to ensure data-driven improvements — ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience and safety.

At the core of the new platform are the patient advocates who help patients navigate the MHS.

“An advocate is the shipmate, the battle buddy, and the wingman,"" said Crane. “PAART enables an advocate to document interactions and ensure warm handoffs and transfers to the appropriate person who can provide service recovery.""

Capturing the patient experience

PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments. Advocates can select preestablished fields including case date, type, location, and patient category.

The system categorizes cases by severity, which dictates the timeline for resolution:

Emergent cases, posing an immediate threat to life or safety, are flagged for immediate action.

Urgent cases, with a significant impact on health, have a 24-hour response time.

Routine cases are to be completed within 10 business days.

Crane noted PAART’s technology will flag cases to ensure meeting those windows, giving leaders ""at each level an awareness of those timelines and where we are in meeting them.""

The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels. Using the PAART system is mandatory for patient advocates — and a vital measure of effectiveness. PAART data can be used to analyze patient feedback and identify common trends, which ultimately assist in developing solutions as well as inform training programs for military hospital and clinic staff. The portal enables advocates to inform supervisors or military hospital and clinic leadership of concerns expressed by patients in their local area.

""It will allow us to see how we're doing across the entire system,"" Crane said. ""We will be able to identify which areas we can work on or which areas we can leverage and are doing well. We can learn best practices and incorporate those best practices across our system.""

Improving patient experience through PAART

Crane said the new system ""allows transparency at all levels: at the MTF level, at the network level, and at headquarters.”

Through centralizing feedback, the DHA aims to foster a ""culture of continuous improvement,"" Crane said. She noted the system strengthens trust by showing patients that the DHA created it with them in mind: When feedback goes into a system where it can be tracked, trended, and escalated, it counters the feeling that a complaint ""goes nowhere.""

""This was designed with the patient at the center of everything we're doing,"" she added, “we want to make sure that our patients’ voices are being heard and that they're being provided with the appropriate service recovery. That is what’s necessary to ensure the patient journey and experience is where it needs to be.”

Safeguards are in place to protect patient confidentiality. All users of PAART must complete Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training, and patients can choose not to provide certain demographic information if they feel uncomfortable.

Looking ahead, Crane envisions technology will always evolve and that ""we are here to ensure that our patient advocates at the MTFs have the tools, resources, and training that they need to successfully complete their job and be the advocate our beneficiaries deserve.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9463019.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-26 13:56:28.667597

His insights into the program’s funding mechanisms and his understanding of the demographics associated with the current and future participants in this critical senior program were the origin of Association’s position, resulting in the AMAC Social Security Guarantee.

The Social Security Guarantee (SSG) has undergone several iterations since its 2014 creation, each time adjusting the components to accommodate evolving conditions. Most recently, AMAC convened a dedicated working group to evaluate Social Security’s worsening financial trajectory and recommend changes to the SSG that would lead to its preservation and its modernization to meet the challenges of 21st Century economics. This process examined many proposed solutions presented in recent Trustees Reports and selected the alternatives felt to be best suited to save Social Security’s retirement trust fund. These proposals have been combined with our own research to achieve what we believe to be the best path to long-term trust fund solvency without the necessity of tax increases.

A summary of the current AMAC Social Security Guarantee can be viewed on the AMAC.us website. The full SSG research paper and recommendations can be downloaded from that site.

In 2013, AMAC—The Association of Mature American Citizens—took a big step with the creation of the AMAC Foundation, Inc., a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit entity designed to serve Americans. The Foundation’s mission is to help protect and ensure the financial security, health, and social lives of current and future mature Americans, and to help Americans navigate the bewildering array of decisions they need to make.

The Foundation’s projects and plans include providing factual information that improves understanding of the positive value of Social Security and Medicare and the current and long-term challenges these programs face, as well as providing interpretations by Certified Social Security Advisors through AMAC publications, workshops, webinars, podcasts, and telephone support.

In addition, the Foundation serves all Americans in a variety of capacities, including provision of a source of education on the principles of American Free Enterprise, long-term retirement financial planning, and preparing for life—and potential employment—after retirement.

In September, a congressionally mandated review from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that the Department of Defense (DoD) is falling short for military families with autistic children, denying full insurance coverage for the gold-standard autism therapy and limiting children’s ability to receive that care in schools and at home.

The report recommends that TRICARE, the military’s health insurance, cover the gold-standard autism therapy, applied behavior analysis (ABA), as a basic coverage benefit.

Healthcare Innovation spoke with Julie Kornack, founding board member of The National Coalition for Access to Autism Services (NCAAS)...

The stress and trauma that are part of military life can often cause personnel to turn to drugs or alcohol. Studies have shown that one in ten veterans are diagnosed with substance use disorder, a slightly higher proportion than the general population [1]. In an attempt to aid the recovery of military personnel and veterans, and help them and their families lead healthy, productive lives, the government established Tricare insurance. Tricare offers multi-tiered coverage for medical treatment for active military, veterans and their dependents. In this article, Avenues Recovery shares guidance on eligibility and treatment options covered by Tricare, including Tricare substance abuse coverage.

What Treatment Types Does Tricare Cover?

Included in the long list of Tricare-covered treatment are the following [2]:

Applied Behavior Analysis

Autism Spectrum Disorder

Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy

Collateral Visits

Drug Testing

Eating Disorder Treatment

Electroconvulsive Therapy

Family Therapy

Gender Dysphoria

Intensive Outpatient Programs

Inpatient Hospital Services (emergency and non-emergency)

Management of Withdrawal Symptoms (Detoxification)

Medication Assisted Treatment

Office Based Opioid Treatment

Opioid Treatment Programs

Partial Hospitalization program

Psychoanalysis

Psychological Testing

Psychotherapy

Psychotropic Drugs

Residential Treatment Facility Care

Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Therapeutic Services

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

Conditions such as PTSD, depression, and all forms of addictions are covered by Tricare plans as well.

Locations for Tricare Insurance

Tricare is available across the globe [3]. Its management is split into three different regions.

Tricare West includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa (excludes Rock Island arsenal area), Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri (except St. Louis area), Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas (southwestern corner including El Paso), Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

Tricare healthcare plans in this region are administered by Health Net. This means that Health Net serves as the contractor to the government to provide access and benefits to the end users, in this case active military personnel, veterans, and their dependents. They provide networks, claims processing, and education.

Tricare East includes, Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa (Rock Island area), Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri (St. Louis area), New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas (excluding El Paso area), Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

The contracting partner for the eastern region is Humana Military.

Anywhere outside the United States is called the overseas region, and is managed by International SOS.

Tricare Plans and Eligibility

Tricare offers several different plans, each with unique eligibility, benefits and costs. A common question we get asked is “does Tricare cover therapy for dependants of military personnel?”, and the answer is yes. Returned soldiers often have emotional scars that affect those they live with, in many cases to the extent that family members of veterans require therapy themselves.

Tricare Prime

Who can enroll?

Active military personnel and family members

Retired military veterans and dependents (until eligibility for Medicare is reached)

Those who have received the Medal of Honor and families

Activated members of the National Guard, and in some cases Reserve and Retired personnel.

Former spouses who fill specific qualifications.

Any member of Prime on active duty as well as their families have zero out-of pocket costs. All others are subject to nominal enrollment fees and co-pays.

Tricare Select

Select is accessible in the U.S. and is a fee-for-service program. All above-mentioned members are eligible, excluding those on active duty. Out-of-pockets costs will include annual deductibles and some cost sharing. This varies according to each client’s military status.

Select can be a great option for those who have supplemental insurance to Tricare, like Medicare or commercial insurance from their workplace, or people who are happy with their current healthcare situation and don’t want to change to an in-network Tricare provider.

In order to confirm your eligibility and registration, connect with a preferred Tricare addiction treatment center. Because Avenues Recovery is one of the Tricare-approved rehab facilities, we are authorized to provide Tricare benefits and can get you properly set up right away. Our staff will navigate the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) [4], get you registered, and connect with your Primary Care Physician (PCPM) to arrange necessary referrals. All you have to do is give us a call, and we will take care of the rest!

Variations of these two main plans include:

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

TRICARE Select Overseas

TRICARE For Life

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

TRICARE Young Adult

Tricare Substance Abuse Coverage

People receiving addiction treatment services from an approved provider such as Avenues Recovery can often receive Tricare substance abuse coverage. Medications and care for detox and residential treatment are all part of Tricare benefits. Furthermore, once a member is enrolled in Tricare-approved drug rehab programs like inpatient rehab and Partial Hospitalization Programs, drug and alcohol detox services may be included as well.

Does Tricare Cover Inpatient Rehab?

Yes! As long as you have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD), are dealing with withdrawal symptoms requiring medical attention, and are having difficulties coping with daily routines, residential treatment is absolutely necessary and covered by your Tricare plans. This falls under emergency treatment.

In the event of non-emergency addiction treatment, such as when a person feels the need for treatment on his own, he must be authorized by Tricare or its managing partner. Avenues can help facilitate those authorizations upon contact from the client seeking addiction treatment.

Does Tricare Cover Outpatient Programs?

When qualifying, Tricare will give coverage for many types of outpatient treatments . Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) and PHP are often eligible. There are many individuals who while not needing round the clock medical care and supervision, greatly benefit from treatment groups and counseling sessions offered by Tricare preferred providers. The flexibility of such treatment gives clients the chance to resume their daily routines, family responsibility and jobs while remaining under the care of addiction treatment facilities. In some cases, Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is necessary and covered as well.

Can Veterans Affairs Beneficiaries Access Tricare?

The Department of Veterans Affairs is a cabinet-level agency tasked with providing benefits and and support for military veterans in their time after service. The VA provides health care through its medical facilities and clinics across the country. Since 1995, every Veterans Affairs’ health care facility has been part of the Tricare network [5]. This means that they are able to service all Tricare members, including Active Duty personnel, retirees and their families on a space available basis. This is true for both primary and specialty care.
