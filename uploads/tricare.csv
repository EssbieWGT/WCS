The letters are mailed to impacted beneficiaries by the pharmacy contractor at least 30 days prior to the formulary change.
Providers and beneficiaries can refer to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool for information on tiered copay status and other requirements, including pre-authorization or quantity limits.
To alleviate beneficiary confusion and comments regarding TRICARE Formulary Change Beneficiary letters, the DHA created five letter templates for pre-authorization, step therapy, non-formulary, non-covered and OTC removal changes.
The beneficiaries are also provided with the link to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool that provides more information on TRICARE covered drugs, including any restrictions and which provides any applicable pre-authorization forms.","The National Defense Authorization Act required the establishment of a Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee (P&T) for fiscal year 2000. Its purpose was to develop and maintain a Uniform Formulary of medications—a list of brand name and generic drugs and supplies that TRICARE covers—which provides pharmacy benefits in the outpatient setting.

The Department of Defense Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee meetings are held quarterly, with recommendations determining which medications are included on the Uniform Formulary based on clinical and cost-effectiveness of the agents. The DOD P&T committee recommendations are then discussed publicly with the Beneficiary Advisory Panel.

The Beneficiary Advisory Panel is comprised of nongovernmental organizations representing DOD beneficiaries, pharmacy contractors and TRICARE network providers. Federal law requires that the BAP review and comment on the DOD P&T committee recommendations for implementing formulary changes to Tier 3 status, pre-authorization criteria, and implementation periods. The BAP is unique in that it gives beneficiaries a voice about what medications are included on the formulary, while providing transparency to what is often an unpublicized process in other health systems. Following the BAP comments, the final formulary decisions are reviewed and signed by the director of the Defense Health Agency.

Beginning in October 2007, the DOD took measures to improve communication with beneficiaries concerning formulary changes. Among the new measures, patient-specific notification letters were mailed to beneficiaries impacted by a variety of formulary changes. Examples include an increase in the cost-share (Tier 3 status), and a change from a preferred to a non-preferred status, which can include, but is not limited to, new step therapy or pre-authorization requirements.

TRICARE added a limited number of OTC drugs to the formulary and made them available at all three points of service: military pharmacies, home delivery, and at retail network pharmacies. Additionally, a variety of OTC products are available only at military pharmacies. The DOD P&T committee reviews the OTC drug classes to determine which drugs should and should not be covered, and occasionally an OTC drug will be removed from the benefit, in which case affected beneficiaries are notified.

Working with several avenues for beneficiaries to submit questions and through different sources, including the pharmacy benefit manager contractor, DHA realized that individual letters describing the upcoming formulary changes required streamlining. The new individual letters describe the upcoming formulary change, lists options for formulary alternatives that the beneficiary and their doctor can consider, includes the associated copay information, and documents the implementation date for the associated change. The letters are mailed to impacted beneficiaries by the pharmacy contractor at least 30 days prior to the formulary change.

In 2018, the NDAA directed TRICARE to add a fourth “not covered” tier to its formulary, which excludes coverage of pharmaceutical agents that have little clinical effectiveness and aren’t cost effective. Similar to commercial pharmacy benefit plans, beneficiaries must pay the full out-of-pocket cost for these completely excluded drugs at retail network pharmacies and these agents aren’t available at military pharmacies or home delivery. The DOD P&T committee not only evaluates drugs for exclusion from coverage, but also identifies branded drugs that may be moved to Tier 1 (generic formulary) status with a lower copayment for beneficiaries. Providers and beneficiaries can refer to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool for information on tiered copay status and other requirements, including pre-authorization or quantity limits.

To alleviate beneficiary confusion and comments regarding TRICARE Formulary Change Beneficiary letters, the DHA created five letter templates for pre-authorization, step therapy, non-formulary, non-covered and OTC removal changes. All new letters immediately begin with the date of change and impacted drug in bolded font so beneficiaries can easily know the important details up front. In addition, the letter outlines the reason for the formulary change. A separate letter is attached so that beneficiaries can share the information to review with their health care provider. The beneficiaries are also provided with the link to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool that provides more information on TRICARE covered drugs, including any restrictions and which provides any applicable pre-authorization forms.

In 2019, in addition to mailing letters to beneficiaries 30 days prior to the formulary change implementation date, DHA also published letter templates on the beneficiary website so beneficiaries could access them directly. Posting the letters on the website helps alert beneficiaries of upcoming formulary changes and has also aided in reducing the level of confusion.",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Default-MHS-Seal.png,N,0.0,2025-06-15 16:56:20.798222

FALLS CHURCH, Virginia – The Defense Health Agency announced that TRICARE beneficiaries in six Kansas counties may receive emergency prescription refills now through June 19, due to flooding.

The counties affected are Butler, Chase, Coffey, Greenwood, Harvey, and Sedgwick.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families.

Between 2018 and 2022, Ghosh orchestrated a scheme involving false diagnoses, unnecessary and sometimes non-existent procedures, and fraudulent billing, pocketing over $2.4 million from federal health programmes and private insurers. The court has ordered her to pay $1.5 million in restitution, and she faces multiple civil lawsuits from affected patients.

A Web of Deceit: Patients Betrayed and Lives Altered

Dr Mona Ghosh operated Progressive Women’s Healthcare in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, where she built a reputation as a trusted OB-GYN, particularly among women from lower-income and minority backgrounds. However, investigations revealed a disturbing pattern: Ghosh routinely misdiagnosed patients with serious conditions such as cancer, pressuring them into undergoing aggressive, unnecessary procedures.

Many of these treatments, including endometrial ablations and biopsies, were not only unwarranted but also performed without proper consent, resulting in lasting physical and emotional trauma. Several women lost their fertility as a direct consequence. Former patient Socorro Urbano, who is now part of a civil lawsuit against Ghosh, stated, “She has altered lives indefinitely; it’s something you can’t take back.”

During sentencing, U.S. District Judge Franklin Valderrama condemned Ghosh’s actions, saying, “You irrevocably harmed women who put their trust in you. You used your patients to bankroll your luxurious lifestyle.” Ghosh’s medical license has been permanently revoked, and she is required to report to prison in September 2025.

How the Fraud Unfolded: Investigations and Legal Fallout

Federal prosecutors, with support from the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services, uncovered that Ghosh’s scheme was both elaborate and systematic. She directed her staff to falsify patient records, exaggerate symptoms, and use incorrect billing codes to inflate insurance claims. The fraudulent activities targeted Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers, resulting in more than $2.4 million in illicit gains.

Investigators found that many procedures were either never performed or medically unnecessary, with some patients unaware that their medical records had been falsified. The trauma inflicted on patients was a key factor in the severity of Ghosh’s sentence.

In addition to the criminal case, nearly 100 former patients are pursuing civil lawsuits, seeking compensation for the physical and psychological harm they endured. The case has prompted calls for stricter oversight of private medical practices and more robust mechanisms for patients to report suspected malpractice.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The Mona Ghosh case is a tragic reminder of the sacred trust that must exist between doctors and their patients. When that trust is violated, the consequences can be devastating and lifelong. Ghosh’s actions not only defrauded public health systems but also robbed women of their health, dignity, and future possibilities.

This case underscores the urgent need for stronger regulatory frameworks, better patient education, and a healthcare culture rooted in empathy and accountability. As we reflect on this disturbing episode, we must ask: What more can be done to protect vulnerable patients and ensure that medical practitioners always put care before profit?",https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-Social-Thumbnail-Template-69.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-14 05:56:19.303344

Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.","Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapy rooted in the science of learning and behavior. Using principles of ABA, children and adults can learn to improve their communication skills, social skills, and daily living skills while also addressing problematic or challenging behaviors. The primary goal of ABA therapy is to teach helpful skills that promote independence and reduce harmful behaviors. Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

Operating out of her medical office, Progressive Women’s Healthcare in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, Dr. Ghosh submitted false claims to Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers between 2018 and 2022, billing for procedures that were either unnecessary or never performed.

Who is Mona Ghosh?

Dr. Ghosh was found guilty of submitting claims for a range of medical services, including endometrial ablations, biopsies, ultrasounds, vaccinations, blood tests, and STD screenings, many of which were either not performed or performed without patient consent. Additionally, she exaggerated the length and complexity of office and telemedicine visits, using incorrect billing codes to seek higher reimbursements.

Federal investigators also found that Dr. Ghosh fabricated patient records to support her fraudulent claims, further complicating her extensive scheme. The fraudulent actions not only resulted in stolen taxpayer money but also endangered the health of Ghosh’s patients. According to prosecutors, some of the unnecessary procedures performed by Ghosh limited patients’ ability to have children in the future. “Dr. Ghosh’s fraud scheme was particularly egregious because she endangered the health of her patients by performing unnecessary procedures,” said U.S. Attorney Andrew S. Boutros. “She not only stole taxpayer funds but also caused harm to those who trusted her with their health.”

Investigators’ remarks on the case

The scheme was uncovered through a joint investigation by the FBI, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense, among others. FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Douglas S. DePodesta said, “The depraved conduct uncovered in this case represents an extreme betrayal of trust toward patients who were simply seeking care and integrity from their doctor.” Authorities emphasised the seriousness of medical fraud, especially when it comes to healthcare professionals exploiting vulnerable patients and defrauding taxpayer-funded health programs. In addition to her 10-year prison sentence, Dr. Ghosh has been ordered to pay approximately $1.5 million in restitution to cover the stolen funds.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-.-2025-06-13T215512.327.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-13 23:56:21.095260

A Walter Reed spokeswoman said Thursday that two nurses at the clinic, which provides infusion services for kidney, some gastroenterology and other department patients, went on emergency leave, forcing hospital leaders to shift staff from other areas of the hospital to support clinic operations.

Ricardo Reyes, a public affairs officer at Walter Reed, said no appointments were canceled and ""all patients scheduled for this week have been rescheduled.""

A patient said that late last week they were notified by staff that the clinic would be closed for two weeks and told to make alternate arrangements.

The patient said they were shifted to Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, which also has a limited number of staff to support infusions and is a 90-minute drive during most times of the day from Walter Reed.

""We are working to make sure next week's scheduled patients are covered,"" Reyes said in an email to Military.com on Wednesday. ""This is a temporary situation, and we expect to be back to normal operations later this month.""

An April 2024 Defense Department report to Congress said that the facility was staffed at just 79% of its authorized number of personnel, with nurses having the lowest staffing rate at 68%.

To address the issue, the Defense Health Agency launched an effort with the medical commands of the military services to develop a Human Capital Distribution Plan, or HCDP, to determine the requirements at all medical and dental facilities to ensure that the facilities were adequately supported by military personnel as well as civilian and contract staff.

In its report to Congress on Walter Reed, Defense Health Agency officials said the HCDP would give the facility the means to fill its empty jobs.

""The HCDP ... will provide Military Health System leaders a way, and the means, to provide military and civil service authorizations filled by the right person, at the time they are needed, achieving great outcomes for our beneficiaries,"" the report stated.

The Defense Department awarded contracts worth up to $43 billion in May 2024 to 11 health care staffing companies to provide contract medical staff as well as support at military treatment facilities and other federal hospitals and clinics in the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.

According to the Defense Health Agency, under the agreements, known as the Medical Q-Coded Support and Services Next Generation contracts, the companies are to provide dental, nursing, physician and medical support staff to augment DoD civilian employees and military personnel at those hospitals and clinics.

Last year, Karen Ruedisueli, director of government relations for health affairs at the Military Officers Association of America, noted that staffing shortfalls at Walter Reed ""could reverberate"" across the military health system because not only is it considered a premier medical center, it is responsible for training the next generation of military doctors, with 53 graduate medical programs for the Army, Navy and Air Force.

""MOAA supports the DoD's revised strategy to stabilize the military health system and improve MTF [military treatment facilities] staffing so MHS [the military health system] can fulfill both readiness and beneficiary care missions,"" Ruedisueli wrote.

In an opinion piece published earlier this month, acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara pledged to work with department leadership to ensure that the military health system has what it needs to serve patients and train physicians.

""Military medicine is a no-fail mission. I'm confident that our success will continue to reinforce the strength that sustains the peace. But should the peace be broken ... our preparation will ensure we break the Walker Dip streak,"" Ferrara wrote, referring to the decline in combat medical skills following the end of a period of war.

Walter Reed is undergoing a multiyear renovation and expansion project, with a new five-story, 533,000-square-foot facility that opened this spring to house operating rooms and ambulatory procedure rooms, women's health, the Mother Infant Care Center and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, dentistry, and dozens of other clinics and services.

A new building, slated to open in 2028, will house optometry, patient transport, the American Red Cross and administrative offices, according to facility officials.

I have found that the doctors have no idea how to write notes that properly answer the prior auth questions.

I had a similar issue getting a common Migraine medication approved (Nurtec), my neurologist was in network, but they don't get copies of the PA form, so he was trying to answer the questions blindly, trying to cover all the bases. Once I gave him the form, my PA for Nurtec was approved almost immediately.

Tricare isn't only. Other insurance has done the same with cigna with me( my wife's employment), blue cross with my coworkers( my employment) and my father n law(medicare). The best way to combat it, is two insurance policy for meds and care.. What the the primary doesn't cover the next one will pay the balance or ask tricare to pay its coverage amount & I will use my 2nd insurance for the remaining balance.

In my experience, specialty meds are usually denied because the prior authorization was not filled out correctly or you did not meet the requirements of the prior authorization. For example, one of the multiple requirements for Rinvoq is that you have tried Humira first and it either did not work or you had adverse reaction.

If you have not already done so, look up each med in the tricare formulary search tool and then click on each drugs Prior Authorization link. Read through it, if it looks like you meet the requirements then talk to your doctor some more or call tricare and ask for a copy of the PA that was submitted.

We didn't get reimbursed for my husband's weekly PTSD therapy for 2023 and most of 2024 until March of this year. It was a nice chunk of money but we could have used it a year before. I still have to fight Humana because they just left off the October-December 2024 claim reimbursements so we only got Jan-Sept back. It is such a hassle that I keep procrastinating doing it.

It is a ridiculous system and is extremely frustrating. Neither Tricare nor the VA could provide a qualified provider to treat my husband's CPTSD so we had to find someone ourselves and pay out of pocket. The provider network is extremely limited because the allowable fees are lower than providers can do or many of the providers that are in network are awful so we pay out of pocket and then wait months or years to be reimbursed?

Now that we have this new West region disaster, I can't even imagine how long the process is going to take. I purposely waited to see if things got better before sending in any claims but we are 6 months in and I need to submit the first half of the year.

From heart disease to diabetes, the state of your gums can significantly impact your long-term health. This article explores the surprising links between oral hygiene and whole-body wellness, offering simple, practical steps you can take today to protect both your smile and your future health.

How oral health works

Your mouth naturally contains many types of germs. Usually, your body’s defenses and good oral care keep these germs under control. Without proper care, however, these germs can reach harmful levels and lead to infections like tooth decay and gum disease.

Some medications can reduce your saliva flow, including decongestants, antihistamines, painkillers, and antidepressants. This matters because saliva helps wash away food and balances acids that germs produce in your mouth, which prevents disease.

How gum health affects the rest of your body

Healthy gums can lower your risk for serious health conditions. Research links oral germs and inflammation (especially from severe gum disease called periodontitis) to problems throughout your body.

According to the National Institutes of Health, conditions linked to poor periodontic health include:

Cardiovascular diseases

High blood pressure

Stroke

Diabetes

Dementia

What healthy gums look like

Healthy gums appear pink and firm and don’t bleed when you brush or floss. You might have gum disease if you notice:

Red, swollen, or tender gums

Bleeding when brushing or flossing

Bad breath that won’t go away

Pain when chewing

Sensitive or loose teeth

Gums pulling away from teeth

Changes in how your teeth fit together

Five simple steps to better gum health

You can protect your gums with these easy steps:

Brush properly: Clean your teeth and gums twice daily. Use gentle, circular motions with a soft-bristled brush. Hard brushing can make your gums pull back from your teeth.

Floss daily: Flossing removes food and plaque between teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach.

Use mouthwash: Try using therapeutic mouthwash to fight early gum disease.

Watch your medications: Some drugs reduce saliva flow, decreasing its effectiveness in protecting your mouth. Talk to your doctor if you notice dry mouth from medications.

See your dentist regularly: Visit your dentist every six months. Early treatment stops gum disease before it causes serious damage.

Eat for gum health

Your diet affects your gums, too. Foods that help your gums include:

Fatty fish rich in omega-3s (like salmon and mackerel)

Fresh fruits and vegetables

Nuts and beans

Vegetable oils

Take action today

When you care for your gums, you protect more than just your smile. Start these simple habits today to enjoy better health tomorrow.

Prosecutors also said some procedures were performed without patient consent, according to a statement issued by the US Attorney's Office, Northern District of Illinois.

Mona Ghosh owned and operated Progressive Women’s Healthcare, which specialises in obstetrics and gynaecology services.

Her fraudulent claims included endometrial ablations and biopsies, ultrasounds, vaccinations, laboratory blood tests, and tests for sexually transmitted diseases.

She used wrong billing codes, a standardised system used to identify and report the services and procedures provided by healthcare professionals in the US, to make the visits seem more serious than they really were, so she could get more money than she was supposed to.

""Ghosh also fraudulently overstated the length and complexity of in-office and telemedicine visits and submitted claims using billing codes for which the visits did not qualify in order to seek higher reimbursement rates. Ghosh prepared false patient medical records to support the fraudulent reimbursement claims"", the statement read.

Ghosh, who belongs to Inverness in Illinois, on June 27 last year pleaded guilty to two counts of healthcare fraud. On June 9, US District Judge Franklin U Valderrama imposed the ten-year prison sentence and ordered Ghosh to pay approximately $1.5 million (approximately Rs 12.5 crore) in restitution.

MONA GHOSH'S FRAUD ENDANGERED PATIENTS' HEALTH: US ATTORNEY

""When physicians submit fraudulent claims to federal health care programs, they divert taxpayer-funded resources away from those who truly need them,"" said US Attorney Boutros.

""Dr Ghosh's fraud scheme was particularly egregious because she endangered the health of her patients by performing unnecessary medical procedures, including procedures that severely limited some patients' ability to have children in the future (sic),"" Boutros added.

The attorney also applauded the victims' strength to come forward and confront this defendant.

It gets worse/more ridiculous. They’re not getting paid yet either.

The 4,000 California National Guard soldiers who President Donald Trump surged into Los Angeles remain unpaid due to delays in issuing official activation orders, leaving compensation and benefits in limbo.

According to more than a dozen Guardsmen across four units who spoke to Military.com, none has received formal activation orders, the critical paperwork that not only authorizes their duty status, but also unlocks pay, Tricarehealth benefits and eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs services. Without those orders, troops remain in a legal and administrative limbo.

Multiple defense officials with direct knowledge of the situation told Military.comthe chaotic and sudden activation of troops has effectively clogged up the flow of administrative work.

Eventually this will get sorted out — but these people have had their lives screwed up so that Trump could play games with them for purely political points.

He wants to normalize sending troops wherever there’s opposition to him in America and crush it. They’re all losers and suckers to him, so he doesn’t care what happens to them — or anyone else.

Want to bet he’ll try to stiff them because the courts have ruled he had no legal authority to deploy them in the first place?
