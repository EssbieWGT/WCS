After testing and health assessments confirmed her eligibility, Higginbotham was placed on the active kidney transplant waitlist.
They have a wonderful team that works together.” Testing confirmed that Higginbotham and Boyd were a perfect match for a kidney transplant.
He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health.
Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!” A Heartwarming Reunion Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise.","Tripler Army Medical Center — A U.S. Marine Corps spouse is thriving today because of a life-saving 2024 kidney transplant and collaboration between Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center. The seamless coordination between the two military treatment facilities, spanning from Hawaii to Maryland, highlights a commitment to comprehensive care for military families and demonstrates the power of collaboration within the Military Health System.

Initial Diagnosis and Challenges

After moving to Oahu following a permanent change of station, Catherine Higginbotham sought iron supplementation due to concerns about fatigue, swelling and anemia. However, a routine checkup at TAMC revealed a diagnosis of kidney disease in July 2023.

Reviewing her records with her doctor, Higginbotham learned that the kidney disease likely began in 2013, following a bacterial pneumonia contracted years prior while stationed at Camp Pendleton. “I didn’t know the bacterial pneumonia was the cause of the acute kidney injury,” Higginbotham said. “Looking back at my health records showed me exactly when the kidney disease began.”

Dr. Myungjin Kim, a nephrologist at TAMC, diagnosed Higginbotham with Stage 5 kidney disease and recommended she be added to a transplant list in July 2023. After being informed of an eight -to-nine year wait list at a local Hawaii hospital due to her blood type, Higginbotham sought evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. She then returned to TAMC for further assessment to confirm her candidacy for a transplant at WRNMMC.

Higginbotham underwent a comprehensive series of tests to assess her suitability and minimize potential complications. These included blood tests to evaluate overall health, kidney function, and blood type compatibility, as well as screening for immune system antibodies that could cause rejection of a donor kidney. Evaluations of heart and lung health were also conducted, along with a general health assessment to determine her overall fitness for the procedure.

“The good news was that I was perfectly healthy except for my kidneys. That was reassuring,” Higginbotham said. “What I learned is that I had to approach the process step by step. I broke it up into manageable parts, focusing on each appointment as it came.”

Fortunately, as Dr. Kim transitioned to WRNMMC, she connected Higginbotham with Dr. Christopher Middleman, a nephrologist who was simultaneously transferring from WRNMMC to TAMC. This seamless handover ensured continuity of care during the doctors’ moves.

After testing and health assessments confirmed her eligibility, Higginbotham was placed on the active kidney transplant waitlist. Concerned about her lack of nearby family support on the island, she took a friend’s advice and posted in a social media group that supports active-duty service members, retirees and service members’ families.

A Social Media Connection

“I woke up in the middle of the night, sobbing, overwhelmed and scared for my kids,” Higginbotham said. “I was on the bedroom floor crying when I heard my friend’s name, Michelle, come into my mind.” Remembering Michelle’s advice prompted her to grab her iPad and post in the group on Sept. 20 about her kidney failure, saying she needed a kidney donor.

Megan Boyd, a U.S. Marine Corps military spouse in Virginia, quickly responded to Higginbotham’s post just two days later, offering to be tested as a potential kidney donor. Boyd underwent testing at WRNMMC on Sept. 22 to determine if she was a potential kidney donor for Higginbotham.

A Perfect Match and a Successful Transplant

“Every single step, it was perfect. It was completely aligned. There was no hesitation,” Higginbotham said. “Just everything matched so well. Walter Reed was systematic in their transplant center. That transplant center should be world renowned. That’s how wonderful it is. They are caring, extremely organized, and empathetic. They have a wonderful team that works together.”

Testing confirmed that Higginbotham and Boyd were a perfect match for a kidney transplant. The transplant was quickly scheduled. Higginbotham described her experience at WRNMMC as calm and reassuring, saying she and Boyd felt well cared for.

The kidney transplant took place on Mar. 28 and was deemed a success. Higginbotham said she was able to briefly meet Boyd the day after the transplant surgery. Boyd knocked on Higginbotham’s door. “The minute she came in and I saw her, it’s a moment I will never forget for the rest of my life,” Higginbotham said. “I hugged her, and she hugged me. What do you say to someone who has saved your life? All I could say was thank you.”

Initial Recovery and Return to Hawaii

Following her kidney transplant, Higginbotham spent two months in Bethesda, Maryland, receiving ongoing care with frequent visits between the Navy Lodge and WRNMMC. She consistently expressed profound gratitude for the dedication and support of the WRNMMC nursing staff, who played a vital role in her recovery. Higginbotham also acknowledged the unwavering support of her family, emphasizing their crucial role throughout the entire process. “The surprising thing was how much better I felt immediately following the surgery,” Higginbotham said. “Before I went into surgery, my kidney function was at seven percent. And now it’s almost at 80 percent.”

Higginbotham returned to Hawaii on Mother’s Day in May 2024 and began post-transplant care with the Nephrology department at TAMC.

Long-Term Care at Tripler and Dr. Middleman’s Role

Kidney transplant recipients face a lengthy recovery process involving a strict medication schedule and regular monitoring to prevent organ rejection and manage side effects. Patients typically take immunosuppressant drugs for life, requiring frequent blood tests to adjust dosages and monitor kidney function. Achieving milestones – such as stable blood pressure, normal lab values, and a gradual return to activity – is crucial. Long-term care also includes vigilant monitoring for infections, as immunosuppressants weaken the immune system, and lifestyle adjustments to promote overall health and protect the transplanted kidney.

Dr. Christopher Middleman continued to oversee Higginbotham’s care upon her return to TAMC, ensuring a seamless transition and providing consistent monitoring and support. Higginbotham credits his dedication to her positive progress and peace of mind. “I wanted to express my gratitude to Dr. Middleman,” Higginbotham said. “I wasn’t scared to come back home, because I knew he would be there waiting. He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health. He also has the rare capability of caring for his patients. It’s a combination of listening to you because he cares about you. He is wonderful. Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!”

A Heartwarming Reunion

Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise. Boyd’s Marine Corps family received permanent change of station orders to the island, bringing the two women together once more. “When I found out Megan was moving to Hawaii, I was overjoyed,” Higginbotham said. “It felt like a gift on top of a gift.”

A strong bond quickly formed between the two military spouses, blossoming into a wonderful and lasting friendship between Higginbotham and Boyd. They now regularly enjoy coffee and long conversations, and Higginbotham considers Boyd more than just her donor. She is a cherished friend and forever part of her family. “Megan and her family have become an integral part of our lives,” Higginbotham said. “I am eternally grateful for her selfless act, and I cherish the friendship we’ve built. I never felt afraid and had a sense of peace going through the transplant. This experience has been a constant reminder of the incredible power of human connection, kindness, and God’s grace in our lives even during times of challenge.”

After that, military families have the option to enroll their children in the TRICARE Young Adult program, which can cost anywhere from $337 to $727 per month.
“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently.
According to Kelly, this legislation could save an estimated 350,000 military families approximately $8,724 per year in healthcare costs.
“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts.","A bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers wants to bring TRICARE in line with most civilian health insurance plans by allowing military dependents to remain on their parents’ coverage until age 26 without paying additional premiums.

The legislation, dubbed the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” aims to align TRICARE eligibility with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires most civilian insurance plans to cover dependents until they turn 26 at no extra cost. The bill has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.

Under current TRICARE rules, dependents are only covered until age 21, or 23 if they are full-time students who receive more than half of their financial support from their parents. After that, military families have the option to enroll their children in the TRICARE Young Adult program, which can cost anywhere from $337 to $727 per month.

Nearly 33,000 families are currently paying those monthly premiums, according to Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), one of the bill’s sponsors.

“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently. This common-sense fix will raise the age limit, allowing military dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance plan until 26, the same age as civilians, without a premium increase,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the bill’s co-sponsor, said in a statement.

According to Kelly, this legislation could save an estimated 350,000 military families approximately $8,724 per year in healthcare costs.

Since TRICARE is a federal healthcare program, it was exempt from parts of the Affordable Care Act, including the rule requiring coverage for dependents until age 26 at no additional cost.

To close that gap, Congress created the TRICARE Young Adult program in 2011, allowing military families to continue covering their adult children up to age 26 but specified that the program had to cover its own costs, requiring families to pay monthly premiums based on commercial insurance rates and coverage.

TRICARE Young Adult costs have skyrocketed over the last decade. In 2015, the monthly premium was $208. By 2020, it had climbed to $376 — an 81% increase in just five years. TYA prime now costs $727 per month per each dependent, representing a 250% increase since 2015.

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” Rye Barcott, co-founder and CEO of With Honor, said in a statement.

The bill was previously introduced in both 2021 and 2023. In 2021, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would cost about $125 million annually.

The bill now has more than 35 bipartisan co-sponsors in the House and is backed by more than 20 organizations, including Blue Star Families, National Military Family Association, Military Officers Association of America, National Guard Association of the United States, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, the American Legion, and Wounded Warrior Project.

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, young adults are the most uninsured age group and have the lowest rate of access to employer-based insurance, as many work part-time or entry-level jobs that don’t offer health benefits.

6 Key Features of the Federal EHR Unified health records consolidate patient data from multiple legacy systems.","Today, in a healthcare facility in North Chicago, Ill., a clinician is making decisions about the treatment she’ll provide to a U.S. military veteran. A year or two ago, she would have had to navigate between multiple electronic health record systems and paperwork her patient had on file, but now she has to click on only one EHR to access the patient’s entire clinical history, allowing her to make the best healthcare decisions.

The technology responsible for that progress: the Federal Electronic Health Record system. Developed jointly by the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs and Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) Office, the software is now used by more than 200,000 clinicians in healthcare facilities across the world.

To learn more about the Federal EHR’s ongoing deployment, FedTech met with three leaders behind the effort: Dr. Neil Evans, acting program executive director of VA’s Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office; Dr. Yvette Weber, program executive officer for Defense Healthcare Management Systems; and Bill Tinston, FEHRM director.

Click the banner below to dive into CDW's latest cloud research.

FEDTECH: Mr. Tinston, the FEHRM unites and supports federal EHR deployment efforts across DOD and VA, as well as the U.S. Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Can you talk a little about the purpose of this technology and why it’s so important to these agencies?

TINSTON: The Federal EHR shows what agencies can do when they work together. Having a single record for the patient creates opportunities for providers to integrate, become more efficient and deliver better healthcare.

It’s technology based on commercially available software — a networked-based solution that allows us to almost instantly promulgate changes and innovations. The beginning of the pandemic was a great example. Physicians had to order COVID tests, and at the few sites where the Federal EHR had already been deployed, this ordering capability was added to the Federal EHR and physicians could order the tests in a matter of hours. In places where they were still using legacy systems, it took weeks to make the same change.

FEDTECH: In early 2024, DOD and VA completed the first joint deployment of the Federal EHR when the system went live at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago. Dr. Weber, with more than 3,500 DOD locations now using this technology — what the Military Health System calls MHS GENESIS — would you describe the rollout as a success?

WEBER: Absolutely. For DOD, success is ultimately defined by how the system enhances the quality of healthcare for our service members, their families, retirees and veterans. With full deployment, patients have experienced significantly improved access to their medical records, and clinicians are better able to coordinate care with comprehensive views of their patients’ medical treatment histories. Paper records that need to be transported to new duty stations will no longer be generated.

From an implementation perspective, we successfully transitioned, on time and within budget, from many separate legacy systems to a single, unified platform. And our success at Lovell FHCC, which is the largest DOD-VA joint facility, really shows the system’s interoperability in how it’s seamlessly connecting patient care from the point of enlistment all the way into and through veteran status.

FEDTECH: Dr. Evans, can you share where VA is at with deployment across its various facilities? And how is the rollout impacting veterans?

EVANS: As of now, the system is live at six VA medical centers and 26 associated clinics. It’s also in use at more than 100 remote sites, including our regional telehealth hubs. We’re currently working on accelerating our deployments across the rest of the enterprise, with plans for 13 new medical centers and many additional clinics to go live with the system in 2026.

From our point of view, this is exciting technology, but not just for technology’s sake. The comprehensive enterprisewide Federal EHR, and the associated health information technologies that integrate with it, power the modern healthcare system and put the “care” into healthcare. It’s a tool that gives providers access to the data they need in the moment to deliver the best and highest quality healthcare to the veteran or service member sitting in front of them.

A cloud-based architecture will feature low-latency, high-performance computing resources that will enable rapid access to patient data.”

Dr. Yvette Weber Program Executive Officer, Defense Healthcare Management Systems

FEDTECH: While the Federal EHR currently resides in a data center that is part of the infrastructure provided by Oracle Health, you’re working with vendors to move the system to the cloud. Can you talk about how this migration is going and the benefits you hope to realize from a cloud-based system?

WEBER: We’re moving to the cloud in phases to make sure we don’t impact the performance of the system. The vendor has planned for a multiyear migration effort, and this includes not just Oracle Health products but more than a hundred pieces of software that integrate with different platforms. We’re really focused on being disciplined — ensuring that we safeguard data with strict cyber protocols, for example — while also moving as fast as we can.

As far as the potential advantages go, a cloud-based architecture will feature low-latency, high-performance computing resources that will enable rapid access to patient data. We’ll have enhanced security measures that are inherent to the cloud, including FedRAMP High authorizations and a defense-in-depth approach to protecting sensitive patient information. And for IT teams, the cloud offers automation tools to simplify management and routine tasks such as scaling and patching.

EVANS: I would reiterate everything Dr. Weber said. We’re all excited about moving to the cloud, and we recognize the value that is going to be realized as part of that effort. I do want to highlight, though, the value that we’re getting from our current solution already. When it comes to the Federal EHR, regardless of how we’re running it — from a data center or in the cloud— what is more important is that it’s a single, integrated system. That’s a major step forward.

Click the banner below for the latest federal IT and cybersecurity insights.

FEDTECH: DOD is now focused on deploying specialized versions of MHS GENESIS to active-duty locations to improve healthcare for military personnel in the field. These are often extremely remote sites with limited connectivity. How might success in this area pay dividends for other Federal EHR users in the future?

TINSTON: These capabilities that DOD is deploying, to meet DOD needs, have the potential to support healthcare for Americans across the board, including at smaller agencies. Both the U.S. Coast Guard and NOAA have ships, for example, with people on board who may need care. Or, think about rural areas or unexpected natural or manmade disasters. The ability to present and capture data about a patient encounter in a poorly connected environment is clearly critical for the military, but it could also be useful in any situation where we don’t have the connectivity that we’re accustomed to. This is again why we do things together, and what makes this work so exciting.

6 Key Features of the Federal EHR

Unified health records consolidate patient data from multiple legacy systems.

Enhanced data sharing facilitates data exchange between agencies and with outside health care providers.

Improved, integrated clinical decision-support tools inform patient care.

A patient portal allows patients to access personal health records.

Population health management tools provide data and analytics solutions support for large-scale health initiatives.

Flexible deployment capabilities enable use in connected and unconnected environments.

Currently, TRICARE dependents can remain on their parents’ insurance policy until they are 21 years old without extra fees, 23 if they are a full-time student.

But keeping a dependent on TRICARE until they are 26 — the standard for civilians with private insurance — comes with a separate monthly premium.

The TRICARE Young Adult Program costs between $337 and $727 a month, according to a press release from Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., one of the bill sponsors.

The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act would extend TRICARE coverage for active-duty and retired dependents up to 26 years old without paying an additional premium.

“As a Navy combat veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices military families make,” Kelly said. “They’ve earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect. That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are also original sponsors of the Senate bill.

Reps. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., introduced the bill in the House.

“The fact that [military families are] forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair,” said Kiggans, a Navy veteran.

“I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to health care,” she added.

The bill was previously introduced in 2021 and 2023.

The legislation is endorsed by several veteran and military service organizations, including NGAUS, which counts it among its top priorities zero-cost health care for every member of the National Guard.

Regardless of any if that, the goal of Tricare is to keep their payouts well below Medicare. The powers that be believe that is important and part of the reason they rarely will pay the maximum. Providers and services members complained years ago this would disincentivize qualified professionals from accepting Tricare. Tricare and our congress disagreed that would happen and to this day this still refuse to see it.

Edit: Autocorrect grammar errors.

Did you receive a copy of the EOB for the patients? The patient has a $32 deductible? Or a $32 co-pay? I think we would need more information on patient demographics (Active Duty, Active Duty Spouse/Dependent, Retiree or dependents, TYA (Tricare Young Adult), Prime or Select). There are a bunch of different combinations, so it's hard to tell just by this post. You can go onto tricare and look yourself up as a provider. They have a space to look up in network providers and out of network providers. Maybe start there and see if you are listed on either of those.

Hopefully someone else will chime in and help you out.

Not a provider. I’ve seen the drastic underpayments for pretty much all of the services my family receives since TriWest has taken over for several providers.

I would contact my state’s department of insurance and at a minimum file a complaint.

My personal theories are: (1) customers will be forced to come out of pocket to continue services because TriWest won’t fully cover costs or (2) every single provider will drop Tricare and everyone will be absolutely fucked.",,N,0.0,2025-07-29 18:56:06.923475

In addition to updating your own DEERS record, your service personnel office will sometimes update your DEERS record following important life events, like retirement.
Check your DEERS record The first step is to check your DEERS record.
Update your DEERS record If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately.
Maintain your DEERS record Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record.","When was the last time you looked to see if your information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System is up to date? If it’s been a while, it’s extremely important to take time and log in to DEERS to review or update your information.

DEERS is key to managing military health benefits, supporting the needs of service members, retirees, and their family members. You should make sure to update your information in DEERS so your family can get the benefits they deserve.

The Defense Manpower Data Center operates DEERS. DEERS contains confidential information about the eligibility of service members, retirees, and their family members for benefit and privilege programs administered by the Department of Defense and the uniformed services. It shows if you and your family members are eligible for and enrolled in TRICARE benefits.

But the Defense Health Agency doesn’t administer DEERS—DMDC does. This means you’re responsible for keeping your DEERS information up to date. You should check your DEERS record on the milConnect website at least once every three months to make sure your family’s information is accurate. If you see anything that’s incorrect, get it fixed right away.

In addition to updating your own DEERS record, your service personnel office will sometimes update your DEERS record following important life events, like retirement. So, you should check your DEERS record often—even if you haven’t recently made updates yourself—to ensure it’s correct.

If your DEERS record is incorrect or outdated, it could lead to:

• Delays in accessing health care, filing claims, and getting prescriptions

• An inability for TRICARE to contact you about your health coverage

• Unexpected bills for health care

• Disenrollment from your TRICARE plan

Want to ensure this doesn’t happen to your family? Follow these steps to find and maintain your information in DEERS.

1. Check your DEERS record

The first step is to check your DEERS record. You can do this on the milConnect website. What are some things to check? As described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet, your DEERS record lists your:

• Service status

• Family status

• TRICARE coverage status and plan

• Contact information, including phone number, mailing address, and email address

You should also review the information for each family member and confirm your personnel, service, and eligibility status are accurate.

Keep in mind, each family member must be registered in DEERS before they can have TRICARE coverage. If you’re a sponsor, you’re automatically registered in DEERS, but you must register your eligible family members.

2. Update your DEERS record

If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately. Sponsors and family members can update their contact information. Your contact information includes your phone number, mailing address, and email address. Here are your options for updating your contact information in DEERS:

• Online: Log in to the milConnect website

• Phone: 800-538-9552 (TTY/TDD: 866-363-2883)

• Mail:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

Attention: COA

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

• Fax: 800-336-4416

If you need to add or remove family members, sponsors must do this in person promptly by going to their nearest ID card office. Only sponsors can add or remove family members. Call or check online for your ID card office’s operating hours and to make an appointment. Don’t forget to bring supporting documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate, or divorce decree.

3. Maintain your DEERS record

Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record. So, the third step is to continue to update your information as soon as a change occurs. You can do this by making sure that every time you have a qualifying life event, you update your DEERS information.

A QLE “unlocks” a 90-day period for you to make changes to your plan. Common examples of QLEs include:

• Retiring or separating from active duty

• Getting married

• Giving birth or adopting

• Moving

• Becoming eligible for Medicare

• Gaining or losing other health insurance

Pat Ryan, an Iraq War veteran who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, has once again introduced a bill that would extend healthcare coverage to the children of active-duty military personnel and veterans.

The bill, known as the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” was first unsuccessfully pushed by Ryan in 2023, along with former U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro, a Republican from Catskill.

The legislation, if enacted, would extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old, lowering costs and ensuring access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country, Ryan’s office said in a news release.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” Ryan said in a statement. “I’m proud that my legislation will right this wrong, and – especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide – will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country.”

“By extending TRICARE eligibility to 26, hundreds of thousands of military families will save as much as $8,724 per year,” the congressman added. “Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

Other advocates said the bill would go a long way in assisting families.

“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” said Besa Pinchotti, chief executive officer of the National Military Family Association, in a statement. “Military families are paying hundreds of dollars each month to provide health coverage for the young adults in their families, while civilian families face no increase in cost related to age.”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21, according to Ryan.

If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first, Ryan’s office said.

Dependents have the option to enroll in the TRICARE Young Adult program, and nearly 33,000 military families choose to do so, Ryan said. “However, they must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium, in a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets,” the news release said.",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DFN-L-041725-ryan-police-push-12-rotated.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:56:33.146976

Roughly 20 million people will eventually move to the new system, myAuth, from the legacy DS Logon authentication system used by roughly 200 DoD and VA websites. The new cloud-based myAuth is more secure than DS Logon and will simplify the verification process, according to Defense Department officials.

""Our beneficiaries, our veterans, our uniform service vendors -- they let us know that they need a credentialing service that better fits their needs and that is more user friendly, [one] that offers them password-less options,"" a defense official said in an interview Monday with Military.com.

The Defense Department will introduce the new system in phases and has started with milConnect, the website for benefits and the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, and ID Card Office Online. Users who go to access those websites via their Common Access Cards or DS Logon credentials will receive prompts to create myAuth accounts.

As of last week, more than 900,000 people, including active-duty service members, dependents, retirees and their family members, had created myAuth accounts.

""Our goal with myAuth was to create a quicker and simpler ... efficient way to access our DoD websites,"" the defense official said.

According to the Defense Department, the myAuth system will let personnel, including service members, civilian employees, contractors and vendors, access personal and business information while on the go when they don't have access to a CAC-enabled computer.

For example, a soldier who needs to access the Defense Travel System to change plans could log in from the road or an airport using myAuth and its affiliated authenticator app, Okta Verify, on their personal computer or cell phone.

According to the official, the DS Logon system is outdated and has several major issues that make it obsolete. It requires users to log in frequently, which is not normally a problem with active-duty personnel and civilian employees who work on government computers but presents roadblocks to those who use it on an as-needed basis. DS Logon also mandated a password change every 60 days, with intricate password requirements.

""The number one complaint that we get is how much of a pain remembering the complex requirements of a password -- so many characters, alphanumeric, can't repeat. You can't have your birth date or anything identifying. It needs to be unique,"" the defense official said.

The new system uses Okta Verify, an app that is installed on a computer or cell phone, for multifactor authentication. The app-based program may present some challenges to users unfamiliar with verification apps or who don't have a smartphone, but the official said the system will ""flex"" to meet their needs.

They added that 99% of users who have requested myAuth credentials have been able to obtain them. A call center has been established at 800-538-9552 to help those who have issues getting a new login or downloading the Okta Verify app.

According to the defense official, the DoD budget includes $8.1 million over the next three years to implement myAuth. But by building the myAuth system so that it uses existing DS Logon accounts to create accounts, the DoD saved $22 million by not having to pay for reverification costs, they added.

The department also is consolidating infrastructure, call center, license support and operational costs -- changes that are expected to save an additional $36 million in the coming years, the official said.

To get a myAuth account, users must have a DS Logon or a CAC card. Those who don't have a CAC or a DS Logon must create a one-time DS Logon account in the next 18 months and then create a myAuth account. If they wait until after the DS Logon system is gone, they will need to reverify their identities, according to the department.

DS Logon isn't the only system that will be replaced by myAuth. According to the Defense Department, other authentication systems across the department will be retired with the adoption of myAuth.

DoD websites that require a DS Logon include eBenefits, Tricare, Military OneSource, MHS Genesis, the Army's Transition Assistance Program portal, and more.

VA websites that use it include AccessVA, the Veteran ID Card center and the VetBiz portal.

The Defense Manpower Data Center is working with the Defense Health Agency to communicate the change to non-CAC card holders through frequently used websites like Tricare, according to the defense official.

""Part of our communication plan is to try and get these veterans signed up now, so when the transition occurs, there's no change to them. They can just use the credential that they've created, already got,"" they said.

Service members often turn to these products to improve performance, build muscle, lose weight, or improve overall health. Unfortunately, the use of some dietary supplements can compromise performance rather than improve it.

“With so many products and claims out there, it can be hard for service members to know what information to trust when it comes to dietary supplements,” said U.S. Army Maj. Jordan DeMay, a dietitian for the U.S. Army Training & Doctrine Command. “Fortunately, Operation Supplement Safety offers trusted, evidence-based tools and resources to help guide informed decisions.”

Operation Supplement Safety, the program of record under the Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the Uniformed Services University, provides evidence-based educational information about dietary supplements, health and wellness products and ingredients. The website has resource and tools to assist service members in making informed decisions about dietary supplements and their ingredients.

Department of Defense Instruction 6130.06, “Use of Dietary Supplements in the DOD,” formalizes OPSS as the Department of Defense program for dietary supplements. It also stipulates that the DOD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients List is housed on the OPSS website. Service members may not take supplements with any ingredient from the prohibited list.

“The OPSS team works closely with all the services to increase education and awareness to promote safer supplement use across the force,” said DeMay. “Tools like the OPSS Scorecard help service members evaluate products right at the point of purchase, and understanding third-party certification can make a big difference in avoiding harmful or banned substances.”

Supplement Safety Tips for Awareness

Before considering taking supplements, service members should know what to avoid when reviewing the label of a dietary supplement, including controlled substances, prescriptions, over the counter drugs, and unapproved drugs.

OPSS provides the following tips if you’re considering the use of a dietary supplement:

Talk with your healthcare provider before taking a dietary supplement. Understand that, by definition, a dietary supplement cannot be used to treat, cure, or prevent any diseases and should not be used in replacement of recommended medications.

Consider the consequences of mixing a dietary supplement with other supplements and medications.

Dietary supplements may change the effectiveness of prescription or over-the-counter medications.

Dietary supplements may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medications and may cause negative side effects.

Dietary supplements may interact with prescription meds needed before, during, and after surgery.

You may consume too much of an ingredient if it is found in multiple dietary supplements you are consuming.

Take only as described on the label.

Do not use dietary supplements as a replacement for consuming a balanced eating pattern. Dietary supplements rarely have the same beneficial effects as eating whole foods.

Do not assume the term ""natural"" means a product is “safe” or has added benefits.

Learn to spot false claims. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Dietary supplements are not reviewed or approved by the Food and Drug Administration prior to being marketed

Look for dietary supplements that display the label of a well-vetted, third party certification program. This will help you avoid adverse events and experiencing a positive drug test.

Always check the DOD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients List before using any dietary supplement.

The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act (H.R. 4768/S. 2448) would address this injustice, allowing military dependents to remain on a parent’s plan until age 26, matching the requirement for civilian plans and saving military families as much as $8,724 per year.

“Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families,” MOAA President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret), said. “A key part of that effort is making TRICARE a competitive, modern health benefit that supports both recruiting and retention.”

Young adults who stay on a parent’s plan maintain access to medical care during a period of major life transition without facing high out-of-pocket costs or risky coverage gaps. Military families were excluded from this protection, as TRICARE coverage ends at 21 (or at 23 for full-time college students).

Once they lose coverage, dependents can purchase TRICARE Young Adult (TYA), costing military families between $337 and $727 a month. Shrinking TYA enrollment suggests this cost is unsustainable for many military families.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” Kiggans said in the release. “Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”

Military families “earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect,” Kelly said in the release. “That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

A federal judge blocked Arkansas’ first-in-the-nation law regulating pharmacy benefit managers, stating in Monday’s order that it “likely violates” the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause and is “likely preempted” by a veterans’ health care program.

Act 624 of 2025 would have banned pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.

Four PBMs, including the three largest in the nation, and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) filed four challenges to Act 624 between May and June. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas combined the four complaints into one case.

Both sides presented their arguments to U.S. District Judge Brian Miller on Wednesday. In Monday’s 17-page order, Miller granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, and the case is expected to go to trial.

Miller agreed with the plaintiffs’ attorneys that Act 624 violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it “appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,” he wrote.

“This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ ‘business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,’” Miller wrote. “…Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth because the statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect ‘locally-operated pharmacies’ as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out of state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.”

Miller called Act 624 Arkansas’ “latest and most aggressive” attempt to regulate PBMs in recent years. Act 900 of 2015 required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, and two 2018 laws prohibited PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors. An additional statute prohibits PBMs from excluding a pharmacy from a health benefit plan if the pharmacy “is willing to accept the health benefit plan’s operating terms and conditions.”

Lawmakers, state insurance department officials, independent pharmacists and the Arkansas Pharmacists’ Association have repeatedly claimed that PBMs routinely violate Act 900 and the 2018 statutes, creating a struggle for independent pharmacies in rural areas to remain operational.

However, “based on the evidence in the record, it appears that these laws are sufficient for the state to achieve its stated purposes of curtailing plaintiffs’ business tactics and minimizing the conflicts of interest inherent in PBM-affiliated pharmacies,” Miller wrote.

He also agreed with plaintiff Express Scripts’ claim that Act 624 impedes its mail-order pharmacy’s requirement to provide prescription medication to members of the military, their families and veterans in Arkansas. ESI Mail Pharmacy Inc. is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.

Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Daniel Volchok, Express Scripts’ attorney, said last week that this provision is insufficient because it covers only a “subset” of medications approved by the Department of Defense for Tricare participants.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys made several other arguments for an injunction that Miller said did not have merit. In one such argument, an attorney for OptumRx, one of the three largest PBMs along with Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, argued that Act 624 violates the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Portions of Iowa’s pharmacy benefit manager law blocked as lawsuit advances

The law, known as ERISA, sets certain standards for employee benefit plans, but Act 624 “does not regulate PBMs in their capacity as employee benefit plan administrators” and instead simply regulates pharmacy licensure, Miller wrote.

An Iowa law meant to regulate PBMs was partially blocked in federal court last week because its mandates of certain cost-sharing arrangements between pharmacies and PBMs potentially violated ERISA, according to the judge’s ruling. Similarly to Arkansas, supporters of the new Iowa law said it would help rural and small pharmacies remain in business.

Miller also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Act 624 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, meaning it imposes a legislative punishment without due process. He said the law does not name specific plaintiffs even though it targets “a very narrow group.”

“While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,” Miller wrote.

CVS Health, which includes plaintiff CVS Caremark, expressed opposition to Act 624 during this year’s legislative session and said the law would force the company’s 23 Arkansas pharmacies to close.

In a statement Monday, CVS Health praised Miller’s ruling and said it is “actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

The Cigna Group, which owns Express Scripts, also praised the ruling in a Tuesday statement.

“We appreciate the Court acting to protect Arkansans’ access to their pharmacies,” Chief Legal Officer Andrea Nelson said. “Every day, our nurses, pharmacists and other dedicated team members provide care to Arkansas patients that can’t be easily replaced, and we will continue doing everything we can to protect Arkansas patients’ access to care and affordable medicines.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pharmacist.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:56:57.731727

Related: Express Scripts, CVS sue Arkansas over PBM pharmacy ownership ban

U.S. District Judge Brian Miller agreed with the plaintiffs that the Arkansas law bans the interstate commerce clause.

The Arkansas law ""appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out-of-state companies, and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,"" the judge wrote in an order posted Monday.

One section of the Arkansas law ""specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs' 'business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,'"" the judge wrote. ""Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth because the statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect 'locally-operated pharmacies' as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out-of-state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.""

The impact: Both the Arkansas law and the litigation could have a big effect on state efforts to regulate health care services and product providers all around the United States.

Employer groups, health care provider groups, antitrust groups and other groups see the Arkansas PBM ownership law fight as a template for future fights over state efforts to regulate ""vertical integration,"" or efforts by a large company at one level in a supply chain for a good or service to combine with a large company at another level in the same supply chain.

Interstate commerce: Miller, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, suggested that looking at a law's legislative history is often a bad strategy because elected officials ""can junk up the record with meaningless drivel,"" but he said a review of the Arkansas law's legislative history ""indicates that it overtly discriminates against out-of-state companies.""

The Arkansas law also imposes an excessive burden, because Arkansas already has other PBM laws, such as a law that requires a PBM to open its network to any pharmacy willing to meet its terms and conditions, that can protect local pharmacies and independent pharmacies from unfair competition, Miller ruled.

Miller also agreed with the plaintiffs that the Arkansas law would violate federal efforts to protect Tricare from state laws.

ERISA: Miller found that the plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on their arguments about ERISA preemption.

The Arkansas law ""does not have an impermissible connection with ERISA,"" the judge wrote.

The law ""does not regulate PBMs in their capacity as employee benefit plan administrators,"" he added. ""Rather, it merely regulates the requirements for obtaining a retail pharmacy license. And while the effect of this regulation would certainly be 'an influence that [would affect an ERISA] plan's shopping decisions,' it would merely be an 'indirect economic influence' that would 'not bind plan administrators to any particular choice and thus function as a regulation of an ERISA plan itself.'""

Reactions: CVS Health welcomed the new ruling.

""We're pleased with the court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation,"" the company said. ""We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.""

A representative for Optum Rx, UnitedHealth's PBM arm, welcomed the preliminary injunction, saying it will let the PBM continue to serve patients in their homes and the clinics they choose.

The Arkansas law ""would reduce access to mail-order, specialty, rare and orphan disease, mental health, and other medications for seniors, residents of rural communities, and people with severe mental health conditions or other complex medical conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disorders — all while increasing the costs of prescription drugs for Arkansans throughout the state,"" the Optum Rx representative said.

A representative for Cigna's Evernorth unit also welcomed the court ruling.

""Every day, our nurses, pharmacists and other dedicated team members provide care to Arkansas patients that can't be easily replaced, and we will continue doing everything we can to protect Arkansas patients' access to care and affordable medicines,"" the Evernorth rep said.

Representatives for Cigna could not immediately be reached for comment.

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin indicated that more court action is coming.",https://k2-prod-alm.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/brightspot/72/8d/3e7dc71241b287e5124ac3568b9f/0923-pbm-contracts-mi.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:57:30.732394

,,2025-07-29 15:40:37+00:00,www.army.mil,Joint Munitions Command manages DOD's low-level rad waste | Article - Army.mil,Not Available,,,,,https://www.army.mil/article/287402/joint_munitions_command_manages_dods_low_level_rad_waste,"ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — The Joint Munitions Command serves as the provider for low-level radioactive waste and low-level mixed waste disposition for the Department of Defense and other federal agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Health Agency, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
The variety of items handled highlights the pervasive, though often unseen, use of radioactive materials in everyday military equipment.
The consolidation facility is specifically designed and equipped to handle radioactive materials, featuring specialized storage areas, processing equipment, and trained personnel.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to recycle and minimize waste,” Kurth said.
Over 198,000 cubic feet of LLRW waste was safely and compliantly disposed of at licensed hazardous waste burial cells.","ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — The Joint Munitions Command serves as the provider for low-level radioactive waste and low-level mixed waste disposition for the Department of Defense and other federal agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Health Agency, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The program ensures these materials are managed in a safe, compliant, and cost-effective manner, protecting both people and the environment. The scope of this responsibility extends far beyond simply disposal; it encompasses the entire lifecycle of these materials from identification to final resting place.

Annually, JMC develops a budget to support assigned Army LLRW responsibilities. Funding goes towards licenses, permits, required training, safety gear and supplies, and U.S. Department of Energy recycling fees. The remaining resources support disposal projects involving the logistical complexities of global travel, specialized packaging materials, and the ongoing maintenance of the consolidation facility, which is managed by JMC.

“Securing consistent funding is vital to the program’s long-term viability and our ability to continue providing essential services to the DOD,” said Mike Kurth, Chief of JMC's Environmental/Health Physics Division. “Fluctuations in funding can impact the program's capacity to respond to urgent requests or invest in new technologies for improved waste management.”

Since 1992, members of JMC's low-level radioactive waste program have traveled across the globe to safely pack and ensure the shipment of common commodities like compasses, chemical agent detectors, optical lenses, and sighting and alignment devices — among other standard issue items for service members and military facilities.

These missions often take personnel to remote locations, including active military bases, storage facilities, and even decommissioned sites. The team works closely with site personnel to identify, categorize, and prepare the waste for transport, adhering to strict regulatory guidelines. The variety of items handled highlights the pervasive, though often unseen, use of radioactive materials in everyday military equipment. This work is essential to maintaining operational readiness while responsibly managing hazardous materials.

In the fall of 2023, a member of JMC’s LLRW team oversaw the preparation and packing of thirteen 55-gallon drums containing contaminated soil in Okinawa, Japan, as part of a complex disposal mission. The individual, a health physicist, was the project manager for the effort, and ensured the work was performed compliantly, timely, and cost effectively. In October 2017, a Marine Corps CH-53E helicopter made an emergency landing in a field outside the Northern Training Area in Okinawa due to an engine fire and was subsequently destroyed, leaving behind contaminated soil. The affected area was excavated, and lab testing revealed hazardous chemicals and radioactive strontium-90 from the aircraft's inspection system. The excavated material, stored at Camp Kinser, was contracted for disposal in the United States.

Despite the technical nature of the work, LLRW missions are not inherently dangerous. Rigorous safety protocols and extensive training minimize risk.

“Safety is always our top priority,” Kurth said. “We follow strict procedures and provide our personnel with the best possible equipment.”

A U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission license allows in-house acceptance at a JMC-managed consolidation facility for any type of low-level radioactive material, as well as processing for recycling or disposal. This license is a testament to the program’s commitment to safety and regulatory compliance.

“The NRC license demonstrates our ability to meet the highest standards of safety and accountability,” Kurth said.

The consolidation facility is specifically designed and equipped to handle radioactive materials, featuring specialized storage areas, processing equipment, and trained personnel. The ability to accept a wide range of materials allows JMC to serve a diverse customer base and streamline the disposal process. Recycling efforts, where feasible, are a key component of the program, reducing the overall volume of waste requiring burial.

“We’re always looking for opportunities to recycle and minimize waste,” Kurth said. “It’s the responsible thing to do, both environmentally and economically.”

Last year, JMC’s LLRW team completed 156 radioactive pack, ship, and disposal projects totaling $8.7 million. Over 198,000 cubic feet of LLRW waste was safely and compliantly disposed of at licensed hazardous waste burial cells.

“The numbers demonstrate the scale of our operation and our commitment to responsible waste management,” Kurth said. “We’re proud of the work we do to protect people and the environment.”

This impressive volume demonstrates the program's efficiency and effectiveness in managing a significant amount of radioactive waste. The disposal process is meticulously documented and tracked to ensure full accountability and compliance with all applicable regulations. The licensed hazardous waste burial cells are carefully selected and monitored to prevent any environmental contamination. The success of these projects underscores the dedication and expertise of the JMC team and their commitment to protecting both people and the planet.

“People are often surprised to learn how many items contain small amounts of radioactive material,” Kurth said. “Our job is to ensure those items are handled responsibly at the end of their life.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/07/29/bdf9885e/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 12:40:33.834467

The rodeo aims to ensure service members in the National Capital Region are ready to deploy by offering fast and complete care.
“A medical readiness event, like this rodeo, brings together medical professionals under one roof who can efficiently check off a lot of these boxes.
Medics crucial in battlefield and at home The health readiness rodeo is testament to the crucial trust between provider and patient.
“By ensuring our service members have every opportunity to maintain their well-being, we enable our warfighters to deploy on a dime to win America’s battles.”","Andrew Rader Army Health Clinic, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Virginia, hosted its monthly, walk-in health readiness rodeo designed to “enable the readiness of our joint force,” said U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Matack, the clinic’s senior enlisted leader. The rodeo was held on July 18, 2025.

The rodeo aims to ensure service members in the National Capital Region are ready to deploy by offering fast and complete care. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines can update medical records, complete exams, and get cleared for duty—all in a single visit.

“There are dozens of examinations and training requirements that must be completed before a service member is considered deployable,” said U.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj. Kenyon Simmons, Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. “A medical readiness event, like this rodeo, brings together medical professionals under one roof who can efficiently check off a lot of these boxes. The streamlined process makes it much easier to ensure the readiness of our warfighters to deploy at a moment’s notice.”

These events streamline routine care by providing services such as immunizations, labs, vision, hearing, and periodic health assessments, allowing service members to stay focused on training and mission tasks without prolonged clinic wait times, according to U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Emilio Rios, the clinic’s noncommissioned officer in charge.

Medical ‘team effort’

Each readiness event is coordinated across multiple military health units. “It’s a team effort across the installation to utilize all of our providers, staff, and medics to support this event to ensure the readiness of warfighters who attend from across the NCR,” said Matack.

Bringing in professionals from multiple departments and locations is key for the success of the rodeo, according to U.S. Army Capt. Anna Zhang, clinic director of readiness and optometry. “While a majority of core staff are from Rader, we also call upon medics from the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment and providers from McNair Health Clinic.”

“Our monthly readiness rodeos provide service members with an opportunity to address all their medical readiness concerns in one visit,” Zhang added. “Vision, immunizations, audiology, and laboratory services are available on a walk-in basis daily at Andrew Rader Health Clinic—but on rodeo days, we have providers performing the periodic health assessment as a walk-in service as well.”

Health readiness rodeos ensure ready medical force

The rodeo isn’t just good for troops. It also strengthens medical staff. Matack emphasized the critical, multiple roles of his medics to ensure service members meet mission demands, calling them the “Swiss-Army knives” of the team. He credited Rios, and active duty logistics and medical staff for their work to “cross-train their medics to make them more versatile.”

“Our medics and staff get regular, hands-on experience across multiple readiness tasks, keeping their clinical skills sharp and ensuring they’re just as ready to deploy as the service members they support,” said Rios.

Busy rodeo events help them get practice working quickly and effectively, he said, skills they’ll need during emergencies or deployments. “Our high-traffic rodeo days can help our healthcare professionals hone their ability to efficiently and effectively operate at scale if and when necessary,” said Zhang.

Medics crucial in battlefield and at home

The health readiness rodeo is testament to the crucial trust between provider and patient. “As warfighters, we would not be able to accomplish our mission without medics and other healthcare professionals,” Simmons said. “Every time we step on the battlefield, we’re comforted to know that a medic is nearby. If we get hit, our survivability rate goes up exponentially when the medic responds to us quickly.”

In today’s high-demand operational environment, that trust is essential to mission success. “Trust is the foundation of a patient-provider relationship,” Zhang said. “Patients depend on healthcare professionals to fix and address their ailments, which makes them feel safe, creating mental resilience.”

The services offered by the rodeo cultivate this trust, and “ultimately, preserve the fighting force,” she said.

The event, ultimately, demonstrates one crucial constant: the unwavering support of the medics, health professionals, and the Defense Health Agency to ensure warfighter readiness. “A medically ready force is a ready force,” Zhang said. “By ensuring our service members have every opportunity to maintain their well-being, we enable our warfighters to deploy on a dime to win America’s battles.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9223403.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:57:44.816899

The TRICARE West region contract transitioned from Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) to TriWest Healthcare Alliance.
​ Both TRICARE contractors reassured healthcare providers and beneficiaries the transition would be seamless and there would be no services interruptions.
​ This survey was developed as a grassroots effort to determine effects to the beneficiaries' access to healthcare services.
Sixty-one percent of survey respondents in TRICARE East and seventy-five percent in TRICARE West reported a disruption in medical services.","On January 1, 2025, TRICARE - the essential healthcare benefit serving millions of service members, retirees, and their families - entered a new cycle of contracts for managing the military's healthcare system.

​

The TRICARE East contracting company, Humana Military, transitioned from Wisconsin Physicians Services (WPS) Health Solutions to a new fiscal intermediary/claims processor, Palmetto Government Business Administrators (PGBA). The TRICARE West region contract transitioned from Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) to TriWest Healthcare Alliance.

​

Both TRICARE contractors reassured healthcare providers and beneficiaries the transition would be seamless and there would be no services interruptions.

​

However, the transition has been marked by serious complications with many beneficiaries reporting barriers to receiving appropriate medical services and extra financial consts.

​

This survey was developed as a grassroots effort to determine effects to the beneficiaries' access to healthcare services. It is not intended to be used for research purposes, but to serve as an indicator for potential larger issues within the military healthcare system.​

Conclusion

Since the launch of the new TRICARE contracts on January 1, 2025, families across the country have experienced a catastrophic disruption in care. Sixty-one percent of survey respondents in TRICARE East and seventy-five percent in TRICARE West reported a disruption in medical services.

​

Obtaining prior authorizations and referrals was a barrier encountered by the majority of survey respondents in both TRICARE regions. This remains a prevalent barrier despite the Defense Health Agency issuing a waiver to allow specialty care referrals without a prior authorization for TRICARE prime beneficiaries. A theme in the military family comments was that providers would not honor the waiver due to lack of trust that TRICARE would later pay for the services provided.

​

The source of these failures lies not only with the regional contractors - Humana Military (East) and TriWest Healthcare Alliance (West) - but with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which bears full responsibility for contract oversight and system accountability.

​

The DHA's implementation and oversight of the transition to new managed care organizations has been fraught with problems that have had severe adverse effects on TRICARE beneficiaries as well as providers.

​

In order to minimize harm to TRICARE beneficiaries, we urge Congress and the Department of Defense to quickly remedy these issues and take steps to ensure the highest quality of healthcare for our men and women serving in uniform as well as their families. Failure to do so will result in decreased readiness, resilience, and retention for our armed forces.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6fd4e9_459a9142f92440078e1a2ac2b1849da8%7Emv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_2500,h_1330,al_c/6fd4e9_459a9142f92440078e1a2ac2b1849da8%7Emv2.jpeg",N,0.0,2025-07-29 08:56:34.085367

“We have some very, very strange patterns of deposits [from Humana],” Myers said.
“If things don’t improve, we will have to make some really difficult decisions because we have lost our trust in TRICARE and in Humana Military,” Myers said.
Meanwhile, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va. Beach) announced Monday she wants to expand the TRICARE program.
Kiggans wants to align TRICARE eligibility for dependents with the Affordable Care Act for civilians.","VIRGINIA BEACH (WAVY) — The co-owner of a behavioral health practice in the Lynnhaven area of Virginia Beach said “it’s been a nightmare” dealing with TRICARE claims after Humana Military switched its claims processor to PGBA at the beginning of the year.

“We’ve always had issues, but never to this degree,” said Suzanna Myers in a Monday morning interview. She, her business partner and 12 other providers treat military kids with autism at Pennington Group Full Spectrum Services.

Myers said the bureaucratic hassles have entered a new more frustrating phase.

“We are seeing a lot of erroneous denials,” she said. “There has been a lot of confusion, and we’ve gotten a lot of mixed messages.”

Myers said the problems really began to spiral downward in January when Humana entered a contract with PGBA. She had a banking background before her son with autism inspired her to change careers.

“We have some very, very strange patterns of deposits [from Humana],” Myers said. “And when we have gotten paid, it’s been an administrative and accounting nightmare for us.”

Myers said about 95% of her practice is military families, with annual revenue about $1.5 million.

“It’s a couple hundred thousand dollars a month that is kind of in limbo,” she said. “My business partner and I actually issued loans to our providers using our own personal savings because it was just dire. People were not going to be able to keep a roof over their head or food on the table. So this has been very stressful.”

It was stressful enough for some of her staff to head for the door.

“I have lost two providers because of this,” Myers said, adding that chasing down reimbursement from Humana is keeping her from her core mission. “Personally, I love practicing and working hands-on with my patients. I was unable to do any work with my patients for the first four months of the year.”

10 On Your Side reached out to Humana for comment and they did not immediately respond.

In addition to waiting for reimbursement, Myers said Humana recently sent a number of documents with patients’ private information to the wrong address, one her practice hasn’t used for six years.

“If things don’t improve, we will have to make some really difficult decisions because we have lost our trust in TRICARE and in Humana Military,” Myers said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va. Beach) announced Monday she wants to expand the TRICARE program. Kiggans is a veteran Navy helicopter pilot and mother of four.

Kiggans wants to align TRICARE eligibility for dependents with the Affordable Care Act for civilians. The ACA permits dependents to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26. Currently, TRICARE permits coverage for dependents on parents’ plans only until 21.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” Kiggans said in a news release Monday afternoon. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/snapshot-2025-07-28T194200.880.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-07-29 00:02:35.889496

Nearly 33,000 military families have dependents enrolled in the TRICARE Young Adult program; however, military families must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium.","Concord, N.H. – Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, helped introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan landmark legislation to extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old, lowering costs and ensuring access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country. This legislation is sponsored by Congressman Pat Ryan (NY-18).

“We have a sacred obligation to our servicemembers and our military families – that includes ensuring they have the same access to health care coverage as every other American,” said Congresswoman Goodlander. “I’m proud to introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan legislation to ensure adult children from military families can keep their TRICARE coverage until they are 26, the same as private insurance plans.

By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21 years old. If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first. But, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), children up to the age of 26 can remain on their parents’ health insurance plans with no additional out-of-pocket cost. This legislation would ensure equity for military families by bringing eligibility for young adult dependents in line with that offered by private insurance plans.

Nearly 33,000 military families have dependents enrolled in the TRICARE Young Adult program; however, military families must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium. At a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets, this legislation will deliver much-needed relief.

Act 624 of 2025 was passed in the most recent Arkansas legislative session and is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026.
The Monday ruling places a preliminary injunction on Act 624 pending its full hearing before the court.
In both cases, these are federal constructs that supersede state law.
“We’re pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624,” a CVS spokesperson said.","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A decision in federal court on Monday blocks an Arkansas law from going into effect that blocks PBMs from owning pharmacies.

Act 624 of 2025 was passed in the most recent Arkansas legislative session and is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. It prevented Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state.

A PBM stands between prescription drug plans and pharmacies to set drug prices.

The Monday ruling places a preliminary injunction on Act 624 pending its full hearing before the court. In assigning the injunction, the judge stated the lawsuit seeking to overturn the law will likely succeed based on the act being preempted by the Commerce Clause and the TRICARE prescription claims.

In both cases, these are federal constructs that supersede state law. TRICARE is the pharmacy benefit program for uniformed service members, retired service members and their families.

The opinion also stated that Arkansas has other means to control PBMs than the act’s punitive effect.

Among the groups that lobbied against Act 624 was CVS, which stated that it would be forced to close 28 pharmacies in the state upon the law’s implementation. It filed the lawsuit against the act in May.

“We’re pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624,” a CVS spokesperson said. “We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

An appeal of the Monday ruling is expected.

He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health.
Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!” A Heartwarming Reunion Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise.","Tripler Army Medical Center — A U.S. Marine Corps spouse is thriving today because of a life-saving 2024 kidney transplant and collaboration between Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center. The seamless coordination between the two military treatment facilities, spanning from Hawaii to Maryland, highlights a commitment to comprehensive care for military families and demonstrates the power of collaboration within the Military Health System.

Initial Diagnosis and Challenges

After moving to Oahu following a permanent change of station, Catherine Higginbotham sought iron supplementation due to concerns about fatigue, swelling and anemia. However, a routine checkup at TAMC revealed a diagnosis of kidney disease in July 2023.

Reviewing her records with her doctor, Higginbotham learned that the kidney disease likely began in 2013, following a bacterial pneumonia contracted years prior while stationed at Camp Pendleton.

“I didn’t know the bacterial pneumonia was the cause of the acute kidney injury,” Higginbotham said. “Looking back at my health records showed me exactly when the kidney disease began.”

Dr. Myungjin Kim, a nephrologist at TAMC, diagnosed Higginbotham with Stage 5 kidney disease and recommended she be added to a transplant list in July 2023. After being informed of an eight -to-nine year wait list at a local Hawaii hospital due to her blood type, Higginbotham sought evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). She then returned to TAMC for further assessment to confirm her candidacy for a transplant at WRNMMC.

Higginbotham underwent a comprehensive series of tests to assess her suitability and minimize potential complications. These included blood tests to evaluate overall health, kidney function, and blood type compatibility, as well as screening for immune system antibodies that could cause rejection of a donor kidney. Evaluations of heart and lung health were also conducted, along with a general health assessment to determine her overall fitness for the procedure.

“The good news was that I was perfectly healthy except for my kidneys. That was reassuring,” Higginbotham said. “What I learned is that I had to approach the process step by step. I broke it up into manageable parts, focusing on each appointment as it came.”

Fortunately, as Dr. Kim transitioned to WRNMMC, she connected Higginbotham with Dr. Christopher Middleman, a nephrologist who was simultaneously transferring from WRNMMC to TAMC. This seamless handover ensured continuity of care during the doctors’ moves.

After testing and health assessments confirmed her eligibility, Higginbotham was placed on the active kidney transplant waitlist. Concerned about her lack of nearby family support on the island, she took a friend’s advice and posted in a social media group that supports active-duty service members, retirees and service members’ families.

A Social Media Connection

“I woke up in the middle of the night, sobbing, overwhelmed and scared for my kids,” Higginbotham said. “I was on the bedroom floor crying when I heard my friend’s name, Michelle, come into my mind.” Remembering Michelle’s advice prompted her to grab her iPad and post in the group on Sept. 20 about her kidney failure, saying she needed a kidney donor.

Megan Boyd, a U.S. Marine Corps military spouse in Virginia, quickly responded to Higginbotham’s post just two days later, offering to be tested as a potential kidney donor. Boyd underwent testing at WRNMMC on Sept. 22 to determine if she was a potential kidney donor for Higginbotham.

A Perfect Match and a Successful Transplant

“Every single step, it was perfect. It was completely aligned. There was no hesitation,” Higginbotham said. “Just everything matched so well. Walter Reed was systematic in their transplant center. That transplant center should be world renowned. That’s how wonderful it is. They are caring, extremely organized, and empathetic. They have a wonderful team that works together.”

Testing confirmed that Higginbotham and Boyd were a perfect match for a kidney transplant. The transplant was quickly scheduled. Higginbotham described her experience at WRNMMC as calm and reassuring, saying she and Boyd felt well cared for.

The kidney transplant took place on Mar. 28 and was deemed a success. Higginbotham said she was able to briefly meet Boyd the day after the transplant surgery. Boyd knocked on Higginbotham’s door.

“The minute she came in and I saw her, it’s a moment I will never forget for the rest of my life,” Higginbotham said. “I hugged her, and she hugged me. What do you say to someone who has saved your life? All I could say was thank you.”

Initial Recovery and Return to Hawaii

Following her kidney transplant, Higginbotham spent two months in Bethesda, Maryland, receiving ongoing care with frequent visits between the Navy Lodge and WRNMMC. She consistently expressed profound gratitude for the dedication and support of the WRNMMC nursing staff, who played a vital role in her recovery. Higginbotham also acknowledged the unwavering support of her family, emphasizing their crucial role throughout the entire process. “The surprising thing was how much better I felt immediately following the surgery,” Higginbotham said. “Before I went into surgery, my kidney function was at seven percent. And now it’s almost at 80 percent.”

Higginbotham returned to Hawaii on Mother’s Day in May 2024 and began post-transplant care with the Nephrology department at TAMC.

Long-Term Care at Tripler and Dr. Middleman’s Role

Kidney transplant recipients face a lengthy recovery process involving a strict medication schedule and regular monitoring to prevent organ rejection and manage side effects. Patients typically take immunosuppressant drugs for life, requiring frequent blood tests to adjust dosages and monitor kidney function. Achieving milestones – such as stable blood pressure, normal lab values, and a gradual return to activity – is crucial. Long-term care also includes vigilant monitoring for infections, as immunosuppressants weaken the immune system, and lifestyle adjustments to promote overall health and protect the transplanted kidney.

Dr. Christopher Middleman continued to oversee Higginbotham’s care upon her return to TAMC, ensuring a seamless transition and providing consistent monitoring and support. Higginbotham credits his dedication to her positive progress and peace of mind.

“I wanted to express my gratitude to Dr. Middleman,” Higginbotham said. “I wasn’t scared to come back home, because I knew he would be there waiting. He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health. He also has the rare capability of caring for his patients. It’s a combination of listening to you because he cares about you. He is wonderful. Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!”

A Heartwarming Reunion

Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise. Boyd’s Marine Corps family received permanent change of station orders to the island, bringing the two women together once more.

“When I found out Megan was moving to Hawaii, I was overjoyed,” Higginbotham said. “It felt like a gift on top of a gift.”

A strong bond quickly formed between the two military spouses, blossoming into a wonderful and lasting friendship between Higginbotham and Boyd. They now regularly enjoy coffee and long conversations, and Higginbotham considers Boyd more than just her donor. She is a cherished friend and forever part of her family.

“Megan and her family have become an integral part of our lives,” Higginbotham said. “I am eternally grateful for her selfless act, and I cherish the friendship we’ve built. I never felt afraid and had a sense of peace going through the transplant. This experience has been a constant reminder of the incredible power of human connection, kindness, and God’s grace in our lives even during times of challenge.”

“By ensuring our service members have every opportunity to maintain their well-being, we enable our warfighters to deploy on a dime to win America’s battles.”","Andrew Rader Army Health Clinic, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Virginia, hosted its monthly, walk-in health readiness rodeo designed to “enable the readiness of our joint force,” said U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Matack, the clinic’s senior enlisted leader. The rodeo was held on July 18, 2025.

The rodeo aims to ensure service members in the National Capital Region are ready to deploy by offering fast and complete care. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines can update medical records, complete exams, and get cleared for duty—all in a single visit.

“There are dozens of examinations and training requirements that must be completed before a service member is considered deployable,” said U.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj. Kenyon Simmons, Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. “A medical readiness event, like this rodeo, brings together medical professionals under one roof who can efficiently check off a lot of these boxes. The streamlined process makes it much easier to ensure the readiness of our warfighters to deploy at a moment’s notice.”

These events streamline routine care by providing services such as immunizations, labs, vision, hearing, and periodic health assessments, allowing service members to stay focused on training and mission tasks without prolonged clinic wait times, according to U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Emilio Rios, the clinic’s noncommissioned officer in charge.

Medical ‘team effort’

Each readiness event is coordinated across multiple military health units.

“It’s a team effort across the installation to utilize all of our providers, staff, and medics to support this event to ensure the readiness of warfighters who attend from across the NCR,” said Matack.

Bringing in professionals from multiple departments and locations is key for the success of the rodeo, according to U.S. Army Capt. Anna Zhang, clinic director of readiness and optometry. “While a majority of core staff are from Rader, we also call upon medics from the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment and providers from McNair Health Clinic.”

“Our monthly readiness rodeos provide service members with an opportunity to address all their medical readiness concerns in one visit,” Zhang added. “Vision, immunizations, audiology, and laboratory services are available on a walk-in basis daily at Andrew Rader Health Clinic—but on rodeo days, we have providers performing the periodic health assessment as a walk-in service as well.”

Health readiness rodeos ensure ready medical force

The rodeo isn’t just good for troops. It also strengthens medical staff.

Matack emphasized the critical, multiple roles of his medics to ensure service members meet mission demands, calling them the “Swiss-Army knives” of the team. He credited Rios, and active duty logistics and medical staff for their work to “cross-train their medics to make them more versatile.”

“Our medics and staff get regular, hands-on experience across multiple readiness tasks, keeping their clinical skills sharp and ensuring they’re just as ready to deploy as the service members they support,” said Rios.

Busy rodeo events help them get practice working quickly and effectively, he said, skills they’ll need during emergencies or deployments.

“Our high-traffic rodeo days can help our healthcare professionals hone their ability to efficiently and effectively operate at scale if and when necessary,” said Zhang.

Medics crucial in battlefield and at home

The health readiness rodeo is testament to the crucial trust between provider and patient.

“As warfighters, we would not be able to accomplish our mission without medics and other healthcare professionals,” Simmons said. “Every time we step on the battlefield, we’re comforted to know that a medic is nearby. If we get hit, our survivability rate goes up exponentially when the medic responds to us quickly.”

In today’s high-demand operational environment, that trust is essential to mission success.

“Trust is the foundation of a patient-provider relationship,” Zhang said. “Patients depend on healthcare professionals to fix and address their ailments, which makes them feel safe, creating mental resilience.”

The services offered by the rodeo cultivate this trust, and “ultimately, preserve the fighting force,” she said.

The event, ultimately, demonstrates one crucial constant: the unwavering support of the medics, health professionals, and the Defense Health Agency to ensure warfighter readiness.

“A medically ready force is a ready force,” Zhang said. “By ensuring our service members have every opportunity to maintain their well-being, we enable our warfighters to deploy on a dime to win America’s battles.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9223400/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-28 16:56:11.543333

The seamless coordination between the two military treatment facilities, spanning from Hawaii to Maryland, highlights a commitment to comprehensive care for military families and demonstrates the power of collaboration within the Military Health System.

Initial Diagnosis and Challenges

After moving to Oahu following a permanent change of station, Catherine Higginbotham sought iron supplementation due to concerns about fatigue, swelling and anemia. However, a routine checkup at TAMC revealed a diagnosis of kidney disease in July 2023.

Reviewing her records with her doctor, Higginbotham learned that the kidney disease likely began in 2013, following a bacterial pneumonia contracted years prior while stationed at Camp Pendleton.

“I didn’t know the bacterial pneumonia was the cause of the acute kidney injury,” Higginbotham said. “Looking back at my health records showed me exactly when the kidney disease began.”

Dr. Myungjin Kim, a nephrologist at TAMC, diagnosed Higginbotham with Stage 5 kidney disease and recommended she be added to a transplant list in July 2023. After being informed of an eight -to-nine year wait list at a local Hawaii hospital due to her blood type, Higginbotham sought evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). She then returned to TAMC for further assessment to confirm her candidacy for a transplant at WRNMMC.

Higginbotham underwent a comprehensive series of tests to assess her suitability and minimize potential complications. These included blood tests to evaluate overall health, kidney function, and blood type compatibility, as well as screening for immune system antibodies that could cause rejection of a donor kidney. Evaluations of heart and lung health were also conducted, along with a general health assessment to determine her overall fitness for the procedure.

“The good news was that I was perfectly healthy except for my kidneys. That was reassuring,” Higginbotham said. “What I learned is that I had to approach the process step by step. I broke it up into manageable parts, focusing on each appointment as it came.”

Fortunately, as Dr. Kim transitioned to WRNMMC, she connected Higginbotham with Dr. Christopher Middleman, a nephrologist who was simultaneously transferring from WRNMMC to TAMC. This seamless handover ensured continuity of care during the doctors’ moves.

After testing and health assessments confirmed her eligibility, Higginbotham was placed on the active kidney transplant waitlist. Concerned about her lack of nearby family support on the island, she took a friend’s advice and posted in a social media group that supports active-duty service members, retirees and service members’ families.

A Social Media Connection

“I woke up in the middle of the night, sobbing, overwhelmed and scared for my kids,” Higginbotham said. “I was on the bedroom floor crying when I heard my friend’s name, Michelle, come into my mind.” Remembering Michelle’s advice prompted her to grab her iPad and post in the group on Sept. 20 about her kidney failure, saying she needed a kidney donor.

The legislation, titled the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” would extend TRICARE coverage for active duty and retired beneficiaries up to 26 years old without paying an additional premium — a standard that exists for civilians with private insurance.

The House and Senate bills were introduced by veterans in Congress who say it would save military families money each year. The bill has support from members of both parties and was previously introduced in 2021 and 2023.

Currently, TRICARE dependents can remain on their parents’ insurance policy until they are 21, or 23 if a full-time student, without extra fees. Full-time students must prove that their parents provide more than half of their financial support.

But unlike civilian insurance plans, keeping a dependent on TRICARE until they are 26 comes with a separate monthly premium, a rule established by the Young Adult Program in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. Nearly 33,000 military dependents have TRICARE coverage under the Young Adult Program and spend between $337 and $727 each month for a premium, according to a release from Sen. Mark Kelly (D-N.J.), one of the bill sponsors.

“The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair,” House bill sponsor Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) said in a release.

The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, requires that most insurance plans offer dependent coverage until age 26. The ACA was signed into law in March 2010 and has survived several attempts by Republicans to repeal the law.

The ACA’s age rules aimed to bridge a health insurance gap faced by many young workers and recent college graduates. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, nearly 30% of adults between 18 and 26 do not have insurance and make up more than one in five of the uninsured across the U.S. This group also has the lowest rate of access to insurance through their employers because they often hold entry-level, part-time or small business jobs with limited insurance offerings.

While many adults in this age range can be covered by a parent’s insurance — which parents often receive through their employer — the children of active duty or retired military members covered by TRICARE face an additional premium.

“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association, said in a press release. “Military families are paying hundreds of dollars each month to provide health coverage for the young adults in their families, while civilian families face no increase in cost related to age.”

Rep. Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.), one of the bill’s sponsors, said in a release that extending TRICARE coverage could save hundreds of thousands of military families more than $8,700 each year.

The legislation is endorsed by a host of veteran service organizations and military family advocacy groups like the American Legion, Blue Star Families, Gold Star Spouses of America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, National Guard Association of the United States, Service Women’s Action Network, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.",https://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/9094900_dd9e36-e1753728257232.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-28 16:56:19.381382

A new augmented reality tool will soon provide enhanced decision-making and training for medics and corpsmen.

A 21st century augmented reality visualization tool developed by the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) will soon give medics and corpsman the ability to “see” 3D anatomy graphics and triage information as they are treating wounded warfighters in the field.

The potential benefits? The ability to assess and treat battlefield casualties more quickly and more effectively with fewer medical personnel, in addition to providing medical units with a 21st century training tool for enhanced training and increased readiness.

Initiated by the Defense Health Agency Small Business Innovation Research program in 2019, the USARIEM then designed augmented reality software for the Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) as a wearable tool designed to provide enhanced training through high-tech visual capabilities for Army combat medics and Navy hospital corpsman. While wearing the IVAS goggles equipped with the USARIEM software, a medic or corpsman can visualize the internal anatomy of a wounded warfighter by projecting a morphed version of preprogrammed anatomy onto the real-world view of the warfighter.

The tool has already been demonstrated at several Army, National Guard and Navy sites, but is currently being evaluated for transition to the U.S. Marine Corps to help wounded warfighters.

BENEATH THE SURFACE

When the IVAS goggles are activated, the user can see the simulated internal anatomy of the whole warfighter and use brief verbal commands to select the anatomical systems that they wish to have displayed in their field of view overlayed on the view of the warfighter.

For example, if a warfighter sustains a leg injury, the medic or corpsman wearing the goggles can focus on the femur, tibia, fibula or any other bones or tissue affected in their visual scene to assist in decision-making, increasing the efficiency of treatment. Another key aspect of this software is that a user can pull advisory text from the Tactical Combat Casualty Care Quick Reference Guide and then list procedural information on the side of the field of view. This has the dual utility of providing more lengthy guidance during training and providing terse critical information that can be called up in combat as an instant refresh to the medic or corpsman.

Recently, one of USARIEM’s industry collaborators produced graphical guidance in the form of a virtual “expert” that appears in the user’s IVAS field of view. The expert’s hands are recorded by the user or a senior medical professional in a previous rehearsal session. Visible on IVAS, the hands can facilitate an expert training of the medic or corpsman and provide guidance for battlefield procedures that require prolonged field care.

TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FUTURE OF TRAINING

Navy Lt. Anh Nguyen, a student in the Cyber Systems and Operations Department at the Naval Postgraduate School, is studying the virtual expert software as part of his master’s thesis, titled “An Evaluation of Perceptually Enabled Task Guidance to Enhance Training and Operational Effectiveness for the U.S. Marine Corps.” Nguyen’s ongoing study is quantifying the effectiveness of usage by providing just-in-time perceptual cues through visual and auditory feedback. In addition, he is recording his perceptions during use to explore the psychological and physical side effects of prolonged augmented reality system use.

Marine corpsmen, like Army medics, typically operate in unique and diverse environments based on mission requirements. Often serving alongside Marine infantry, corpsmen must complete specialized field medical training, in addition to basic medical training. Corpsmen can be relatively young, from 19 years old to their early 20s, as most enlist right out of high school. They receive their basic medical training at the Medical Education and Training Campus in San Antonio, Texas, where they learn their foundational medical knowledge, terminology, anatomy, physiology and lifesaving skills.

Corpsmen receive their specialized field medical training at the Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) at one of two locations—FMTB West at Camp Pendleton, California, or FMTB East at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. This training qualifies them to become Fleet Marine Force hospital corpsmen. The FMTB schoolhouse teaches corpsmen specialized skills for operating within Marine units, providing combat medicine and tactical combat casualty care training. As corpsmen are often embedded with Marine units, their roles require them to be highly adaptable to meet both the physical and clinical demands of a combat environment.

Corpsmen, like medics, face complex environmental stressors—such as treating wounded warfighters while under fire. Cutting-edge technologies like the IVAS can augment their experience and provide additional aids for timely decision-making, including the virtual expert guidance, which can serve as a valuable source of supplemental training or a refresher. The IVAS does not require network or cloud communications and can function in all domestic and international environments. These technologies are designed to enhance knowledge and skill, but they are also created to not overwhelm or add to the stress of the user.

CONCLUSION

The main advantage of augmented reality software and goggles or glasses is the ability to put graphical and textual information directly into the field of view of the user at the moment it’s needed. This approach is a powerful source of information not satisfied by old technology, hard copy manuals, training videos or other traditional training aids. The corpsmen and medic tool is designed to be an application of state-of-the-art technology to provide combat support for medical readiness and to support timely return-to-duty. It is a prime example of bringing information on demand, at any time and in any environment to the user, with the user in control of content and delivery.

The system is responsible for caring for over nine million uniformed service members, military families, retirees and contractors around the world, while also providing care for wounded service members at home.
In March, a military health care expert testifying before Congress warned that without major interventions to fix deficiencies in the system, the M.H.S.
Military housing and health facilities can’t sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait or shoot down Iranian ballistic missiles in the Persian Gulf.
But the administration must understand that future diversions will continue to erode the quality of the Military Health System and military housing, undermining personnel morale, readiness and retention and diluting recruiting power.","For 12 days in June, the United States teetered on the edge of yet another war in the Middle East. We seem to have avoided the worst for now, but there is a chance that fighting between Israel and Iran could resume — especially if diplomatic efforts to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions fail. And pressure on President Trump from prominent interventionist Republican policymakers remains to support a regime change operation against Iran, which also risks reigniting the conflict.

At the same time, the threat of war with China looms large. China continues to rapidly expand its Navy and build capabilities that would enable it to seize Taiwan if it so chooses. We are now less than 18 months away from 2027, the year that Admiral Phil Davidson, a former commander of the military Indo-Pacific Command, once said China could be able to seize Taiwan through force. A war with nuclear-armed China would be several orders of magnitude more dangerous than a war with Iran.

Regardless, the United States still must be prepared to wage a major conflict. And while there is no doubt that the U.S. military remains the most powerful and capable fighting force in the world, it is suffering from systemic challenges in a critical component of warfighting success: personnel readiness.

Even on the modern high-tech battlefield, war is still a people business. For the Department of Defense, this means it must care for its people along with developing its weapons in order to maintain lethality while also creating an environment that incentivizes Americans to continue to serve. When service members and their families cannot rely on the programs that are intended to ensure their quality of life, it distracts them from their duties, which inevitably limits their effectiveness in combat.

A critical challenge the second Trump administration inherited is the state of the Military Health System. The system is responsible for caring for over nine million uniformed service members, military families, retirees and contractors around the world, while also providing care for wounded service members at home. But the system has been declining, and budgets for military hospitals have fallen by nearly 12 percent since 2015. As a result, its ability to provide adequate care to these groups and support the Defense Department in a major military conflict has become severely compromised.

Military treatment facilities currently face a global maintenance backlog exceeding $10 billion, which has led many M.H.S. hospitals to fall into disrepair. The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside of Washington, D.C., which routinely treats presidents and members of Congress, had to evacuate several clinics earlier this year, owing to burst pipes that resulted from delayed maintenance.

In March, a military health care expert testifying before Congress warned that without major interventions to fix deficiencies in the system, the M.H.S. would slide into “medical obsolescence.” Jeremy Cannon, a retired Air Force trauma surgeon and medical professor, estimated that in a war with a high volume of casualties, “many of these patients will have survivable injuries, yet one in four will die at the hands of an unprepared system.”

Military housing is also in disarray. In October 2024, the Government Accountability Office found that persistent housing shortfalls for military families in some areas threaten overall quality of life and financial stability for service members and could lead to “negative effects on performance and mission, especially for lower ranked, junior personnel.” Other facilities and services designed to support military families — in particular day care centers on military bases — are increasingly strained as well.

The Navy secretary John Phelan was apparently shocked after touring barracks for sailors and Marines in Guam in May. The barracks were plagued with mold, exposed electrical wiring and damaged plumbing, which made the building practically unlivable. That situation is unfortunately not unique; the Marine Corps alone reportedly estimated it will need $1.5 billion a year over the next decade to bring its barracks around the world up to standard.

Fortunately, Mr. Trump’s recently passed domestic policy law includes nearly $9 billion to improve military quality of life, with a significant portion of that money earmarked to address the poor state of military health care facilities and housing that the Trump administration inherited.

It is also imperative that both Congress and the administration resist pressure or temptation to redirect this money to other priorities, as has happened in the past. The lobbying power of major defense acquisition programs far outmatches those speaking up for military personnel. The military, too, has had to redirect money from quality of life initiatives to other more urgent priorities. This occurred most recently when the Defense Department planned to shift $1 billion away from barracks improvements to support efforts to improve border security. That mission is critical to our nation’s safety, but there have been times when the Pentagon has prioritized funds to sustain missions less essential to national security, such as the Iraq war, which shouldn’t have been fought in the first place, and nation-building in Afghanistan.

Leaders at the Pentagon and in Congress must avoid these diversions and the pressure to start more unnecessary wars that further undermine readiness to deal with actual threats to our safety. Military housing and health facilities can’t sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait or shoot down Iranian ballistic missiles in the Persian Gulf. But the administration must understand that future diversions will continue to erode the quality of the Military Health System and military housing, undermining personnel morale, readiness and retention and diluting recruiting power.

The individuals who serve in our military are some of the best, brightest and bravest our country has to offer. This was recently exemplified by the dozens of pilots who flew a 37-hour round-trip mission to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, a feat unmatched in American military aviation history. But in order for service members to be successful at fighting and winning America’s wars, they must have quality housing, health care and services that enable them to focus on their core responsibilities.

About AL001

AL001 is a novel lithium-delivery system that has the potential to provide the benefits of marketed lithium salts while mitigating or avoiding currently experienced toxicities associated with lithium. Results from Alzamend’s completed Phase IIA multiple-ascending dose study of AL001 in Alzheimer’s patients and healthy subjects identified a maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”), as assessed by an independent safety review committee. This MTD is designed to be unlikely to require therapeutic drug monitoring while providing lithium at a relatively modest but effective dose. AL001 is designed to favorably distribute lithium in the brain resulting in lower exposure of other body organs and an improved safety profile compared to currently marketed lithium salts. This can serve to mitigate or obviate the disadvantageously low ceiling for toxicity of marketed lithium salts that has limited their usefulness to patients and prescribers.

In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital as its clinical trial site, Alzamend initiated the first of five Phase II clinical studies of AL001 in May 2025, with the first study in healthy human subjects. Alzamend aims to explore the unique properties of AL001 and its potential to deliver lithium more effectively in the brain compared to marketed lithium salts. The study in healthy human subjects will serve as a baseline and assist Alzamend in determining the best path forward in Alzheimer’s, BD, MDD and PTSD patients by demonstrating AL001’s targeted effectiveness and reduced systemic side effects. Previous studies in mice have shown that AL001 ensures better brain absorption while maintaining lower levels of lithium in the blood, paving the way for safer and more efficient treatments. Alzamend expects to present topline data from this study by the end of 2025.

Summary: The current study is designed to quantitate differences in lithium brain-to-plasma exposure in PTSD subjects between AL001 and lithium carbonate for the purpose of contributing to a composite database of analogously studied brain-plasma assessments that include data from healthy subjects and multiple additional neurodegenerative, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Currently, AL001 is targeted for treatment of Alzheimer’s, BD type 1, MDD and PTSD. It’s anticipated that this study design may help target appropriate AL001 lithium systemic dosing for these indications in future studies. Using this study design, comparable target organ (brain) lithium concentrations may be quantitated between AL001 and lithium carbonate and, by equivalence inference, lithium citrate solution and syrup.

About AL001

AL001 is a novel lithium-delivery system that has the potential to provide the benefits of marketed lithium salts while mitigating or avoiding currently experienced toxicities associated with lithium. Results from Alzamend’s completed Phase IIA multiple-ascending dose study of AL001 in Alzheimer’s patients and healthy subjects identified a maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”), as assessed by an independent safety review committee. This MTD is designed to be unlikely to require therapeutic drug monitoring while providing lithium at a relatively modest but effective dose. AL001 is designed to favorably distribute lithium in the brain resulting in lower exposure of other body organs and an improved safety profile compared to currently marketed lithium salts. This can serve to mitigate or obviate the disadvantageously low ceiling for toxicity of marketed lithium salts that has limited their usefulness to patients and prescribers.

In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital as its clinical trial site, Alzamend initiated the first of five Phase II clinical studies of AL001 in May 2025, with the first study in healthy human subjects. Alzamend aims to explore the unique properties of AL001 and its potential to deliver lithium more effectively in the brain compared to marketed lithium salts. The study in healthy human subjects will serve as a baseline and assist Alzamend in determining the best path forward in Alzheimer’s, BD, MDD and PTSD patients by demonstrating AL001’s targeted effectiveness and reduced systemic side effects. Previous studies in mice have shown that AL001 ensures better brain absorption while maintaining lower levels of lithium in the blood, paving the way for safer and more efficient treatments. Alzamend expects to present topline data from this study by the end of 2025.

Prebiotic foods include apples, artichokes, asparagus, bananas, berries, green vegetables, onions, tomatoes and garlic.
Talk to your doctor about any nutrient deficiencies you may have, as these can affect feelings of stress and mental well-being.
Foods to Alleviate Stress Foods to combat stress include the minerals, zinc and magnesium, and vitamins C, B, and E, according to CHAMP.
Foods high in these nutrients are the foods of choice.","Mental well-being is as crucial to a warfighter’s medical readiness as physical fitness. While nutrition is well known for its contributions to physical fitness, it’s often lesser known for its cognitive benefits.

“Overall dietary pattern is more important than any one singular food for mental performance and emotional well-being,"" said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Tanisha Currie, associate director of Center for Enabling Capabilities located at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

Through psychological, social, nutritional, spiritual, and physical fitness resources, the Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the University of Uniformed Services—otherwise known as CHAMP—has tools to fuel for the fight, guides for optimal nutritional fitness, and a food journal to give you insight into your nutrition intake. The resources also provide advice on what to eat to perform at your best—both in body and mind.

Eating Habits to Support Emotional Well-Being

According to Currie “A strategy that warfighters can incorporate in their day-to-day routine is to “eat the rainbow,” a simple phrase that refers to eating colorful fruits and vegetables which can contribute to your mental well-being.”

CHAMP provides simple guidelines to be mindful of what you eat to meet your mental and physical occupational and training demands, such as:

Eat small, well-rounded meals throughout the day to provide your brain and body with steady energy to avoid hypoglycemia and be prepared to handle stressors.

Follow the anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet, which is high in unsaturated fats, omega-3 fatty acids, colorful fruits and vegetables, and high-fiber whole grains.

Include prebiotics and probiotics in your day. Prebiotic foods include apples, artichokes, asparagus, bananas, berries, green vegetables, onions, tomatoes and garlic. Sauerkraut, miso, tempeh, pickles, yogurt, milk, kefir, and kombucha are just a few foods that include probiotics.

Choose foods for what they can do for you, rather than how they make you feel. Nutrient-dense foods build stress resilience.

Boost your intake of magnesium to regulate muscle and nerve functions, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. Foods like legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, green leafy vegetables fortified breakfast cereals, milk, and yogurt, are high in magnesium.

Eat plenty of foods high in B vitamins. These nutrients support metabolism, brain development, blood and nerve cell health, DNA production, and the development of serotonin, which affects mood, memory, and emotions. Foods like poultry, fish, potatoes, noncitric fruits, beef, liver, clams, fish, and milk are all high in B vitamins.

Fuel your body consistently. Balance meals and snacks with whole grains, lean protein, fiber, and healthy fats to help keep your blood sugar steady. Avoid skipping meals.

Rethink your meal choices on the night shift. At night, your body’s metabolic processes slow down. Eating at night has been shown to be bad for your health, though the right type and number of foods and beverages can help keep up your blood sugar to stay alert.

Be aware of foods or beverages with stimulants or hidden caffeine sources.

Get a caffeine boost, but not too much. Caffeine improves alertness, vigilance, attention, and reaction time when taken in small to moderate amounts. Caffeine may also help mental performance in sleep-deprived situations.

Drink enough water. Water is the most abundant component of the human body—around 50–70% of your weight—so your body needs fluids regularly to function properly.

Increase Vitamin D in your diet. Foods with naturally occurring vitamin D include fatty fish, fish oils, egg yolks, butter, and liver. You can also get vitamin D from “fortified foods,” which is where vitamins or minerals are added to foods during processing to increase their nutritional value. Vitamin D keeps bones healthy and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.

Talk to your doctor about any nutrient deficiencies you may have, as these can affect feelings of stress and mental well-being. Too little energy, carbohydrates, and micronutrients can increase your vulnerability to stress.

Foods to Alleviate Stress

Foods to combat stress include the minerals, zinc and magnesium, and vitamins C, B, and E, according to CHAMP. The B vitamins and magnesium are involved in the production of serotonin, which helps regulate mood and relieve stress. Foods high in these nutrients are the foods of choice.

Also, “foods rich in antioxidants such as fruits, teas, and dark chocolate can help to reduce oxidative stress, provide neuroprotection, and mood regulation,” said Currie. “Particularly, berries offer great sources of vitamin c and potent antioxidants. Bananas, which are rich in vitamin B6, and tryptophan are also known to promote positive mood.”

To alleviate or prevent some of the consequences of chronic stress, CHAMP recommends the following food list to minimize weight gain due to overeating and excess intake of high-fat or high-sugar foods. These foods include:

Almonds

Beets

Blueberries

Broccoli

Cantaloupe and other melons

Carrots

Garlic

Goat cheese

Green and herbal teas

Green beans

Grapes

Kiwi

Lemon water

Peas

Salmon and other cold-water fish

Sushi

Sweet potatoes

Tomatoes

Whey

Whole-grain rice

Zucchini

CHAMP also recommends avoiding the following foods that may add to stress, including:

Caffeine

Hard liquor

Tobacco

Trans-fats from fried foods, red meats, and highly processed foods

“Warfighters can benefit greatly by understanding the basic elements of foods that can bolster their cognitive health and mood. However, they do not have to go at understanding the basics of nutrition alone. There are terrific and credible Department of Defense resources such as CHAMP, Armed Forces Wellness Center, Operation Supplement Safety, and registered dietitians and healthcare providers to assist them navigating their personal well-being journey together.” said Currie.

If you already done that check if they have sleep center at your VA hospital, they have one here in St Louis. They gave me a new cpap machine then a number to call for my supplies. Now, I ordered it online via the VA website and they give me 6 month supply at a time

I’m retired and only go to VA for my twice a year visit with my Primary and get my eyeglasses. Rest of the time I used my TRICARE Prime

I am in a similar situation and won’t say I’ve cracked the code on the VA, but would suggest you keep at it.

Admittedly, not everyone’s VA is equal. I am fortunate that my local VAMC is excellent and there is a relatively small Veteran population. Does not mean I don’t have to wait for an appointment, but rather the level of care and treatment is excellent since the VAMC is paired with one of the best teaching hospitals in the US.

A lot depends on one’s rating, but guessing by your need for CPAP supplies, your rating is at least 50 percent. Which means your healthcare costs are covered by VA.

The process for CPAP supplies is evolving for the better. Yes, you have to call a number (or two) to then leave a voice mail, but I am getting what I need as once a year I am shipped a box with a year (or more’s) worth of supplies. (I think VA has centralized this.)

Medications are another thing that VA has taken steps to improve the Veterans’ experience. I like that they are sending me text messages to remind me about refills.

Keep plugging away and receive the benefits you’ve earned. And than you for your service!

I am retired and prefer to go to the VA for most things. You need to get established with a primary care provider and have the first visit. From there, it opens everything up. You can then have that doc put in for a referral to the sleep clinic. You don’t have to be seen, you just need to talk to them and tell them what you need. That has been my experience at least. The sleep dudes at the VA are really nice but totally swamped. Using the message system on the app or website for your medical stuff is key. I found the providers to be very responsive using the message system.",,N,0.0,2025-07-27 13:56:09.026449
