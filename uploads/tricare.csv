Military families get accustomed to this pattern: You plan and the United States Armed Forces makes you go back to the drawing board.

Inconveniently, he had pre-deployment work travel pop up while I was ovulating, which is how we found ourselves explaining to the staff at a local fertility clinic that we needed to freeze my husband’s sperm so I could do an intrauterine insemination while he was away.

It was incredibly stressful. It was like the clinic had never dealt with a couple in our situation. We didn’t have fertility issues that we were aware of, but I was 37 and it felt like we didn’t have a month to waste. One staff member tried to charge us for a full IVF cycle, at a cost of at least $10,000. Ultimately, after a negotiation, we were able to get the job done a la carte for several hundred dollars.

The IUI didn’t work. Maybe I do have fertility issues, I thought. I wasn’t exactly young for having children.

I remember thinking how I wished I hadn’t switched to my husband’s military insurance, TRICARE. It covered only fertility issues related to “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.” My employer-provided insurance did, though it was more expensive but significantly cheaper than paying for IVF out of pocket.

I should note that having the choice of two insurance options is something many military spouses do not have. My husband was at the end of his military career, and his home base was stationary. The constant moves that usually define military life wreak havoc on a military spouse finding a job, let alone maintaining a career. Military spouses have an unemployment rate four to five times the national average. TRICARE is often their only choice for medical coverage.

More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn’t offer fertility coverage. A couple of weeks ago, it really looked like it would, which is why as we ring in 2026, I am thinking of the military families struggling to have a baby, for whom this new year will be off to a bitter start.

They were banking on a provision in the massive defense bill signed into law by President Donald Trump just before the holidays that would have given them the same kind of access to fertility coverage that other federal employees have.

The IVF language easily passed out of committees in the House and Senate. But as the bill was buffed and polished into a final version for both chambers to pass and send to Trump’s desk, the IVF provision was stripped from the measure just days before a vote.

It was devastating for military family members like Courtney Deady and her husband, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard, who have been trying to have a baby for a decade.

They’ve spent $100,000 on multiple attempts to conceive by intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.

“It’s the mental health, it’s the travel,” Deady said. “There’s so many other things, such as cryopreservation” of embryos.

Deady has one embryo left for one last round of IVF.

She was counting on the fertility coverage in the defense bill. It seemed like it had a real shot. After all, Trump campaigned on making IVF more accessible, and this was the first National Defense Authorization Act he would sign after he reentered the White House.

Broken campaign promise

On the trail in 2024, Trump had pledged that “under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.”

Deady voted for Trump, sold on his IVF promises.

She was buoyed by the executive order he signed in February to ease the financial burdens of fertility treatment and deflated when he signed a defense bill this month that did nothing to ease the financial burdens of IVF for military families.

“It honestly feels, for lack of better terms, more of a slap in the face to a lot of our community when our Congress is receiving a lot of those benefits that we so desperately would love to have on our end,” she told CNN.

Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat wounded veteran who battled infertility and ultimately conceived two children through IVF, was the Senate sponsor of the TRICARE coverage provision.

Duckworth blames House Speaker Mike Johnson for removing it last minute from the bill.

“The committees in both chambers support this. There’s nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“The president of the United States … promised on the campaign trail to make IVF available to all Americans, and I can’t think of a better place to make it available than to the men and women of this great nation,” the Illinois Democrat said.

Duckworth sent a letter to Trump with a handwritten note: “Speaker Johnson wants you to become the deadbeat dad of IVF,” a reference to Trump’s description of himself as “the father of IVF.”

Johnson’s home state of Louisiana has some of the most restrictive laws in the country governing IVF, emblematic of the influence of anti-abortion activists in the state.

Louisiana is the only state to prohibit patients and clinics from disposing of unused embryos, requiring they be shipped out of state.

A spokesperson for Johnson’s office told CNN that expanding access to IVF remains a priority.

“President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF. The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” they said in a statement.

Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.

“When we’ve — all of our families — have really thought logically and we’ve prayed about it or we’ve done the research to figure out what, ethically, this journey looks like for us and to not have that, it goes to show that there’s a … lack of education when it comes to this realm of reproductive medicine,” she told CNN.

There was bipartisan disappointment in the last-minute yanking of the IVF provision and, in the House, a group of veterans and lawmakers representing significant military communities has already reintroduced IVF coverage in TRICARE.

Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a Navy veteran, is among them.

“Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” he said in a statement.

Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation. Access to IVF and fertility care shouldn’t depend on financial means.”

A sacrifice families shouldn’t have to make

I am writing this column with my 7-year-old son fast asleep in his bed, counting my blessings that my failed IUI was my one and only fertility treatment.

After it, my husband returned home from his work trip but deployed before I expected to ovulate again. So, when I realized I was pregnant long after he deployed, it felt like a miracle, especially when my first sonogram showed I was pregnant with twins.

A few weeks after, another sonogram showed I had what’s called “a vanishing twin.” The second embryo had failed to develop. But there was still one. We made it through a large subchorionic hemorrhage of my placenta and a few other difficult moments, including my water breaking a month early while my husband was in Asia on a graduation trip for his eldest child not long after returning from his deployment. Somehow, he made it back for the final minutes of my labor to see our son born.

Not even a year later, my husband deployed again, for longer this time. Military family life was a lot for me to manage, caring for a baby and my young stepson as well, but I can’t imagine not having the chance. Being a military spouse has been one of the best experiences of my life, but nothing surpasses being a mom.

For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn’t have to make.

Ellie Mental Health Faces ‘Substantial Doubt’ Regarding Its Survival ​Ellie Mental Health has been a pioneer in rolling out a franchise model for behavioral health practices.","This is an exclusive BHB+ article

While federal policy shifts dominated 2025 headlines, several quieter stories revealed significant industry transformations happening beneath the surface.

​Many stories exposed critical failures in today’s behavioral health system—from TRICARE’s technical glitches disrupting autism care for military families to Ellie Mental Health’s troubled franchise model.

Yet amid these challenges, promising developments emerged: new opportunities to integrate mental health into maternal care and the advancement of innovative reimbursement models, such as population health approaches.

Every year, as editor of Behavioral Health Business, I go through our archives and look for some of the most under-the-radar stories of the year.

In this BHB+ Update, I will explore:

–Why value-based care could be just the start for new reimbursement models

–What investors are now expecting from mental health startups

–The potential opportunity for maternal mental health integration

Disastrous Tech Failures Clobber Autism Therapy Providers in TRICARE West Region

Early last year, BHB’s Chris Larson reported that a technology issue prevented autism providers in the TRICARE West network from checking member eligibility, submitting or checking prior authorizations, or processing claims.

This meant that autism providers caring for military families went weeks without getting paid for services.

​In turn, this triggered many autism providers to limit or stop services to TRICARE beneficiaries.

​This story was the first story about TRICARE issues, but not the last of the year. In April, we reported that autism providers across the nation were impacted by glitches that impacted the transition of the TRICARE regional contracts at the beginning of the year. In addition to providers in TRIWest, the eastern TRICARE contractor, Humana Military, began to disclose similar administrative problems.

​For months at a time, technology systems didn’t work as promised and payments were not made. This story was important because it meant that providers had to make a difficult decision to continue to serve active military families without a solid payment pathway or cut off vulnerable children from services.

Digital Mental Health Startups Face Profitability Pressure as Investor Landscape Shifts

​In 2021 and 2022, venture capital investors poured billions of dollars into the behavioral health sector. In many ways, this was a huge positive for behavioral health services, where consumers often faced access issues.

​However, with so much competition in the market, investors are now raising their expectations of these digital providers. One of the biggest factors investors are now looking for before providing new backing to startups is profitability.

​“[Profitability is] top of mind more than ever,” Faye Sahai, managing partner of Exbourne Group and founding managing general partner at Telosity Ventures, told Behavioral Health Business for the story. “Several years ago, it was really about the interest, the idea, the momentum, the growth. Now we’re in a market that is really looking at your revenue, your unit cost, net profit, how much you plan to grow.”

Redwood City, California-based venture capital firm Telosity invests in pre-seed, Seed, and Series A-stage startups focused on youth mental health and well-being.

​Digital behavioral health companies are, in many ways, at a crossroads. Many have reached profitability and are growing their service line. However, others are bleeding capital and looking to reinvent themselves.

​This story examines what providers need to do to attract investor interest and stay afloat in a competitive market.

Population Health Management Could Be the Next Frontier for Behavioral Health Reimbursement

We write a lot about the evolution of payment from fee-for-service to value-based care models at BHB. But that may be just the first step for emerging reimbursement models.

​Population health management, often called by payers value-based purchasing, could be the next evolution of payment models. This type of reimbursement is aimed at identifying populations with unmet clinical needs and then providing care pathways to accelerate recovery.

​Unlike traditional reimbursement models, population health management oversees a cohort of patients at the population level. This could include different geographic populations, employee groups, ethnic groups, people with disabilities, or other defined groups.

​This was an important story to tell because we often think of value-based contracting as the one path forward. Yet, value-based care could be just the start for new models of reimbursement.

‘Like Going to the Dentist’: The Business Case for Maternal Mental Health

As integrated care becomes central to behavioral health services, maternal mental health has emerged as a natural opportunity for integration.

There is a major need for services for this population. One in 7 new mothers experiences postpartum depression, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Still, there are barriers to care. For example, the story outlines that there are a few specialized experts in the space.

“There’s a limited number of reproductive or perinatal psychiatrists with specialized expertise and experience caring for women during pregnancy and postpartum,” Dr. Rachel Dalthorp, executive medical director of specialty services at LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST), told BHB. “Some mental health providers are less familiar with prescribing medications in these periods.”

And while awareness around maternal mental health conditions is growing, there are still places to expand OB involvement and referrals.

“Simplified referral processes and collaborative care models can help reduce delays and improve timely access to mental health care,” Dalthorp said. “Payment models, including bundled payments for perinatal OB care, can make it difficult for OBs to be fairly reimbursed for the time they spend supporting moms’ mental health. Separate physical and behavioral health benefits add complexity for clinicians and patients.”

Better integration of mental health into maternity services could serve as a model for future specialty integrations.

Ellie Mental Health Faces ‘Substantial Doubt’ Regarding Its Survival

​Ellie Mental Health has been a pioneer in rolling out a franchise model for behavioral health practices. The BHB team has been closely watching the company because, if successful, it could be a new model for clinicians interested in becoming business owners.

​However, this article revealed that the company is now facing a wave of backlash from its franchises, who claimed it misrepresented the requirements and support they would receive. What’s more, several business owners told BHB that this has left them on the edge of financial ruin.

​Specifically, some franchisees claim that Ellie’s back-end support services are glitchy and slow, inhibiting revenue generation and collection. Several franchisees are now trying to break away from the parent company and have taken Ellie to court arbitration.

​Ellie has, in turn, also taken legal action against the franchisees who have attempted to separate their clinics from the parent company.

​While Ellie and the franchise continue to battle in court, public records demonstrate Ellie faces its own host of financial challenges. In August, Ellie updated its franchise disclosure document (FDD), stating that it faces the likelihood of failure.

​The story is important because it calls into question the viability of the franchise model in behavioral health.",https://bhbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/12/pexels-jeshoots-com-147458-451590-1-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-30 12:56:34.036682

More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn’t offer fertility coverage.
Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.
Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation.
For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn’t have to make.","Back in 2017, when my husband was still in the Army, we learned he was unexpectedly deploying right as we were going to start trying to get pregnant. Military families get accustomed to this pattern: You plan and the United States Armed Forces makes you go back to the drawing board.

Inconveniently, he had pre-deployment work travel pop up while I was ovulating, which is how we found ourselves explaining to the staff at a local fertility clinic that we needed to freeze my husband’s sperm so I could do an intrauterine insemination while he was away.

It was incredibly stressful. It was like the clinic had never dealt with a couple in our situation. We didn’t have fertility issues that we were aware of, but I was 37 and it felt like we didn’t have a month to waste. One staff member tried to charge us for a full IVF cycle, at a cost of at least $10,000. Ultimately, after a negotiation, we were able to get the job done a la carte for several hundred dollars.

The IUI didn’t work. Maybe I do have fertility issues, I thought. I wasn’t exactly young for having children.

I remember thinking how I wished I hadn’t switched to my husband’s military insurance, TRICARE. It covered only fertility issues related to “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.” My employer-provided insurance did, though it was more expensive but significantly cheaper than paying for IVF out of pocket.

I should note that having the choice of two insurance options is something many military spouses do not have. My husband was at the end of his military career, and his home base was stationary. The constant moves that usually define military life wreak havoc on a military spouse finding a job, let alone maintaining a career. Military spouses have an unemployment rate four to five times the national average. TRICARE is often their only choice for medical coverage.

More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn’t offer fertility coverage. A couple of weeks ago, it really looked like it would, which is why as we ring in 2026, I am thinking of the military families struggling to have a baby, for whom this new year will be off to a bitter start.

They were banking on a provision in the massive defense bill signed into law by President Donald Trump just before the holidays that would have given them the same kind of access to fertility coverage that other federal employees have.

The IVF language easily passed out of committees in the House and Senate. But as the bill was buffed and polished into a final version for both chambers to pass and send to Trump’s desk, the IVF provision was stripped from the measure just days before a vote.

It was devastating for military family members like Courtney Deady and her husband, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard, who have been trying to have a baby for a decade.

They’ve spent $100,000 on multiple attempts to conceive by intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.

“It’s the mental health, it’s the travel,” Deady said. “There’s so many other things, such as cryopreservation” of embryos.

Deady has one embryo left for one last round of IVF.

She was counting on the fertility coverage in the defense bill. It seemed like it had a real shot. After all, Trump campaigned on making IVF more accessible, and this was the first National Defense Authorization Act he would sign after he reentered the White House.

Broken campaign promise

On the trail in 2024, Trump had pledged that “under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.”

Deady voted for Trump, sold on his IVF promises.

She was buoyed by the executive order he signed in February to ease the financial burdens of fertility treatment and deflated when he signed a defense bill this month that did nothing to ease the financial burdens of IVF for military families.

“It honestly feels, for lack of better terms, more of a slap in the face to a lot of our community when our Congress is receiving a lot of those benefits that we so desperately would love to have on our end,” she told CNN.

Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat wounded veteran who battled infertility and ultimately conceived two children through IVF, was the Senate sponsor of the TRICARE coverage provision.

Duckworth blames House Speaker Mike Johnson for removing it last minute from the bill.

“The committees in both chambers support this. There’s nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“The president of the United States … promised on the campaign trail to make IVF available to all Americans, and I can’t think of a better place to make it available than to the men and women of this great nation,” the Illinois Democrat said.

Duckworth sent a letter to Trump with a handwritten note: “Speaker Johnson wants you to become the deadbeat dad of IVF,” a reference to Trump’s description of himself as “the father of IVF.”

Johnson’s home state of Louisiana has some of the most restrictive laws in the country governing IVF, emblematic of the influence of anti-abortion activists in the state.

Louisiana is the only state to prohibit patients and clinics from disposing of unused embryos, requiring they be shipped out of state.

A spokesperson for Johnson’s office told CNN that expanding access to IVF remains a priority.

“President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF. The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” they said in a statement.

Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.

“When we’ve — all of our families — have really thought logically and we’ve prayed about it or we’ve done the research to figure out what, ethically, this journey looks like for us and to not have that, it goes to show that there’s a … lack of education when it comes to this realm of reproductive medicine,” she told CNN.

There was bipartisan disappointment in the last-minute yanking of the IVF provision and, in the House, a group of veterans and lawmakers representing significant military communities has already reintroduced IVF coverage in TRICARE.

Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a Navy veteran, is among them.

“Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” he said in a statement.

Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation. Access to IVF and fertility care shouldn’t depend on financial means.”

A sacrifice families shouldn’t have to make

I am writing this column with my 7-year-old son fast asleep in his bed, counting my blessings that my failed IUI was my one and only fertility treatment.

After it, my husband returned home from his work trip but deployed before I expected to ovulate again. So, when I realized I was pregnant long after he deployed, it felt like a miracle, especially when my first sonogram showed I was pregnant with twins.

A few weeks after, another sonogram showed I had what’s called “a vanishing twin.” The second embryo had failed to develop. But there was still one. We made it through a large subchorionic hemorrhage of my placenta and a few other difficult moments, including my water breaking a month early while my husband was in Asia on a graduation trip for his eldest child not long after returning from his deployment. Somehow, he made it back for the final minutes of my labor to see our son born.

Not even a year later, my husband deployed again, for longer this time. Military family life was a lot for me to manage, caring for a baby and my young stepson as well, but I can’t imagine not having the chance. Being a military spouse has been one of the best experiences of my life, but nothing surpasses being a mom.

In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX – Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

As they prepared to start a family, the couple faced the harsh reality of military scheduling, which forced them to adjust their plans at the last minute. During her ovulation cycle, her husband was called away for pre-deployment work travel, necessitating a visit to a fertility clinic to freeze his sperm for an intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedure.

The experience at the clinic was fraught with stress and confusion, as it appeared they were navigating uncharted territory. Although there were no known fertility issues, the woman’s age—37 at the time—weighed heavily on their minds, prompting a hurry to start treatment. Financial challenges compounded their situation, as she learned that her husband’s military insurance, TRICARE, offered minimal support for fertility treatments, only covering issues related to military service injuries or illnesses. A negotiation allowed them to afford the sperm freezing procedure a la carte, but their subsequent IUI attempt ultimately did not yield a pregnancy.

Fast forward over eight years, and the woman’s longing for comprehensive fertility support is echoed by military families across the country. While federal employees’ fertility benefits have expanded significantly in recent years, TRICARE’s limitations remain unaddressed. Many military families, grappling with infertility, had pinned their hopes on a recent defense bill that was believed to include provisions for fertility coverage. As 2026 approached, a sense of disappointment engulfed these families when they learned that the IVF support language had been stripped from the bill just before its passage.

The emotional toll is evident in stories like that of Courtney Deady, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard’s family. Deady and her husband have invested over $100,000 into multiple fertility treatments without success. She describes the mental strain associated with the process, noting that the loss of financial support from the defense bill felt like a betrayal, particularly given a prior promise from former President Trump to address IVF accessibility. Deady, who formerly supported Trump based on his commitment to fertility treatment reimbursement, was left feeling disillusioned by the recent developments.

Additionally, Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran and an advocate for fertility treatment access, has placed blame on House Speaker Mike Johnson for the last-minute removal of the IVF provision. Duckworth argues that the support for this measure had bipartisan backing, indicating a strong desire for change amidst Congress. The disparity between the benefits available to Congress members and military families adds another layer of frustration for those navigating this difficult journey.

Within the military community, leaders like Republican Representatives Nick LaLota and Jennifer Kiggans are advocating for better access to fertility treatments, emphasizing that military families should not sacrifice essential needs for financial reasons. Their statements underscore a collective understanding that without improved reproductive health coverage, many military families will continue to face challenges in building the families they desire.

As the woman reminisces about her own fertility journey, which ultimately led her to become a mother of twins, she acknowledges the privilege of her specific circumstances. Despite the challenges of military life, becoming a mother remains the most fulfilling aspect of her life. However, she recognizes that many military families lack that opportunity, and the gap in fertility coverage continues to be a pressing concern.

December brought with it a season of joy, reflection and connection across our aged care residences. From festive decorations to heartfelt moments shared between residents, families and staff, the past month was filled with celebrations that truly captured the spirit of the Holiday Season.

Festive Decorations & Christmas Cheer

Our age care residences were transformed into festive wonderlands, with Christmas trees proudly displayed, halls adorned with twinkling lights, and residents helping to decorate their spaces. Many enjoyed reminiscing as they hung ornaments, sparking conversations about Christmas past and creating new memories together.

Parties & Special Celebrations

Each aged care residence hosted its own Christmas celebrations, complete with festive music, themed activities and plenty of laughter. Residents dressed up for the occasion, enjoyed singalongs and joined in Christmas trivia and games. These events were a highlight of the month, bringing everyone together in a joyful and relaxed atmosphere.

Delicious Festive Feasts

The holidays wouldn’t be complete without good food, and our residents were treated to special festive menus prepared by our wonderful chefs and hospitality teams. Traditional Christmas lunches, decadent desserts and afternoon teas were enjoyed with friends, family members and staff, making mealtimes extra special throughout December.

In the heart of TriCare’s Compton Gardens Bustling Retirement Village on the northside of Brisbane in Aspley, there’s a gentle hum of connection that has been growing stronger over the past three years. At the centre of it all is Leonie, the Lifestyle Activities Coordinator whose journey from kindergarten teacher to retirement community activity leader has been nothing short of inspiring.

From Classrooms to Community

Leonie spent many years guiding little ones through their first steps in learning, nurturing curiosity and joy in the classroom. When she transitioned into her role at the Compton Gardens Retirement Village, she carried with her the same passion for fostering relationships and creating spaces where people feel seen, valued, and loved.

A Program Born of Compassion

Recognising that many residents had little or no family nearby, Leonie introduced a program that would bring together two groups often in need of connection: retirees and local mothers. Every fortnight, mothers from the community – some traveling up to 40 minutes – arrive at the Compton Gardens Retirement Living Village with their children to share time, stories, and laughter with the residents.

Residents who might otherwise feel isolated find companionship and joy.

Mothers, many with families overseas or interstate, discover a supportive network.

Children bring energy and innocence that light up the room.

Leonie spreads the word through adverts in local community papers, ensuring that the program remains open and welcoming to newcomers. Over time, a group of regulars has formed, creating bonds that feel like extended family including some catching up on weekends or other times at birthday parties and so on.

The Magic of Nursery Rhymes

Ask anyone what their favourite part of the gathering is, and the answer is unanimous: the singing of nursery rhymes! Voices young and old blend together in familiar tunes, sparking memories for residents and delight for children. For Leonie, this moment is the heartbeat of the program, a reminder that music transcends age, distance, and circumstance.

The room fills with laughter when a child forgets a line, or when a resident adds a playful twist to a familiar song. It’s not just singing; it’s storytelling, learning, memory-sharing, and pure joy wrapped into one.

More Than Just a Program

What Leonie has created is more than a scheduled activity. It’s a lifeline of support, a bridge between generations, and a testament to the power of community.

Navy tests new digital health system to modernize at-sea care Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Sasha Ambrose

MAYPORT, Fla. – Navy Medicine conducted its first pilot test of the Operational Medicine Care Delivery Platform (OpMed CDP) aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) to bring modern, seamless patient care to service members aboard ships, Dec. 1-12.

The Joint Operational Medicine Information System (JOMIS), under the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems, developed OpMed CDP as part of modernized health IT software suite. This pilot program was established through a partnership with the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFFC), Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic (CNSL), Commander, Naval Medical Forces Atlantic (NMFL), and JOMIS to gain fleet approval of the software’s functionality.

“The JOMIS ecosystem will transform the way our clinicians, physicians, and corpsmen provide care to warfighters in operational settings to maintain patient data flow through the continuum of care,” stated Lt. Cmdr. Erik Lawrence, U.S. Navy chief nursing informatics officer for JOMIS assigned to BUMED.

During the 12-day test, the ship’s crew received comprehensive, user-centered training on the system. The goal was to make documenting and accessing a patient’s electronic health record simple and accurate – from pharmacy and lab work to general check-ups – and to ensure connectivity with the Military Health System’s MHS GENESIS platform.

“We’re still learning how it [OpMed CDP] works, but the team has been really helpful with answering questions and listening to feedback, so I’m really excited to keep moving,” described Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Johnny Percadoni, assigned to Carney, during a hands-on, scenario-based session. “It’s a different day and a new system, but I think it’s going to become a lot more prevalent and useful for us.”

This phased, structured training install approach – also called fielding – is critical to implementing OpMed CDP across the Navy. The JOMIS Fielding Plan is designed to ensure a disciplined rollout that allows for agile development, continuous user feedback, and alignment with operational readiness cycles.

“We’ve been developing this agile software for the past three and a half years to provide better decision support at the point of care for medical providers,” explained Cmdr. John de Geus, the U.S. Navy’s chief health informatics officer. “But also to provide data to operational commanders in dynamic, real-time environments.”

Based on the initial trial, CNSL has decided to move into the next phase: an extended pilot to ensure that the final product will be resilient, effective, and ready for the demands of the fleet.

""A successful fielding isn't just about delivering software; it's about delivering the right capability,” concluded de Geus. “The initial pilot provided crucial insights, which is why we are moving to an extended pilot. This decision reinforces our commitment to a truly feedback-driven process, prioritizing the needs of our Sailors above all else.”

Once all phases are complete, Carney will be the first ship to use OpMed CDP for daily medical operations. This will modernize Navy Medicine’s readiness and ensure seamless data sharing, ultimately help to prepare warfighters for their missions at sea.

MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE, Ala. – The Maxwell Medical Group's Dental Flight is taking a significant step to boost Airman readiness by restoring advanced in-house oral surgery capabilities and integrating digital dentistry to provide faster, more comprehensive care to the installation's active-duty population.

To better support this readiness posture, the clinic is now equipped to handle complex procedures that were previously outsourced.

“They've been referring out a lot of procedures: root canals, implants, wisdom teeth,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Thomas Hardison, Maxwell Medical Group comprehensive dentist. “And so being here and having the training to do those procedures brought a lot of care back in-house.”

The dental flight’s role is critical in clearing Airmen for deployment, often requiring the team to react with urgency to meet short-notice mission requirements.

“When patients are deploying, we ensure that they are ready to go. If they do have things that are limiting them from going, we will stop what we're doing to get them out the door,” said U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ernessie Ladouceur, Maxwell Medical Group dental flight chief.

While bringing back sedation capabilities has been the most recent focus at the clinic, there are several types of procedures the flight also aims to bring back.

“We'll do implants, sinus lifts, ridge augmentation, and other periodontal surgeries,” said Hardison.

Modernization has been a key component of the clinic's enhanced capabilities, with a renewed focus on digital dentistry. This shift reduces chair time for patients and improves the precision of care through advanced technology.

“We have two 3D printers up and running now,” said Hardison. “We do most everything digitally now. So, we scan everything, 3D print models, and mill restorations.”

Keeping these advanced procedures within the military health system provides a direct benefit to the patient by ensuring all their medical information is centralized and accessible.

“I think the impact is the continuity of care. More patients are being able to have their care here with us and not seeing a provider off base,” said Ladouceur. “It’s one less thing they have to worry about.”

The flight’s core function is ensuring every Airman is medically prepared for global operations.

“The unit's overall mission is to make sure that our active-duty members are able to be fit and ready,” said Ladouceur. “So that way when they're out there, they're not having to worry about something like a toothache.”",,N,1.0,2025-12-29 21:56:30.235908

MADIGAN ARMY MEDICAL CENTER, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash. -- Madigan Army Medical Center has seen huge success with its robotic bronchoscopy program, after becoming the first Military Treatment Facility (MTF) to adopt the Ion endoluminal system. Over a 15-month period, the medical center performed 78 robotic navigational bronchoscopy procedures, achieving a diagnostic accuracy rate of 91 percent.

A majority of the positive diagnoses made at Madigan during this period were cases of lung cancer. In total, 56 cancer cases were identified, along with several cases involving infection, inflammation, or other non-cancerous conditions. The program’s findings also helped guide decisions about surgical treatment. More than 50 patients were referred for surgery based on the results of their robotic bronchoscopy, and in 44 of those cases, the cancer diagnosis was confirmed after the tissue was removed. This high confirmation rate reflects the accuracy of the robotic system in identifying malignant nodules and ensuring patients receive the right care at the right time.

Several features contribute to the program’s outcomes. The Ion system’s shape-sensing technology enables physicians to precisely navigate to the target area, while rapid on-site evaluation allows pathologists to examine biopsy samples immediately during the procedure. Together, these capabilities help clinicians quickly determine whether enough tissue has been collected, reducing the need for repeat procedures.

With its strong performance, low complication rate, and ability to diagnose and guide treatment in a single visit, Madigan’s Ion program represents a major step forward in lung cancer care within the Military Health System. The early results show that robotic-assisted bronchoscopy can improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection while easing the overall process for patients, offering a promising model for future expansion across military and civilian hospitals alike.",,N,1.0,2025-12-30 12:57:02.129080

Take steps to safeguard your growing family Marriage is a major life milestone — and it’s also a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event.","Getting married is an exciting milestone in your life! It’s also a time when many changes come along, including changes to your health coverage. Whether you’re a service member, a retiree, or marrying someone who is, it’s important to understand how marriage can affect your TRICARE eligibility and coverage.

“There is sometimes a misconception that TRICARE benefits will update automatically after you get married, but that’s not the case,” said Shane Pham, an analyst with TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “If you don’t add your spouse to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, they won’t be able to use TRICARE. A small step makes a big difference.”

Marriage is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event, meaning that you have 90 days from the date of marriage to make any changes to your TRICARE health plan. Spouses of service members are eligible for coverage, including active duty spouses, retiree spouses, and National Guard and Reserve spouses.

Stepchildren are also eligible for TRICARE if the parent of the child and the sponsor are married. The sponsor doesn’t need to adopt the stepchildren. But if the sponsor does adopt stepchildren, they may be eligible to keep their TRICARE coverage even if their parent divorces the sponsor.

Update DEERS

After getting married, one of the most important steps is to update your information in DEERS in person. DEERS is a database that TRICARE uses to determine eligibility. You must update DEERS within 90 days of your marriage to make changes to your TRICARE plan.

Although there are many changes you can make online in DEERS, you must add your spouse in person. You can visit any Uniformed Services ID card office to add your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS. Make sure that you bring your:

Marriage certificate

Spouse's birth certificate

Spouse's Social Security card

Spouse's photo ID

Choosing the right health plan for your family

Once you’ve added your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS, you can enroll them in a TRICARE plan. The options available depend on your status and where you live. Options include:

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Select

US Family Health Plan

TRICARE Prime Demo (available only in Atlanta, Georgia and Tampa, Florida areas)

TRICARE Select Overseas

TRICARE For Life (Note: Enrollment isn’t required for TFL. Your coverage is automatic if you have Medicare Part A and Part B and you’re eligible for TRICARE.)

For active duty families, other options may include:

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

If you and your spouse are both active duty service members, you’ll each have your own DEERS profile. If you and your partner have children, you’ll need to choose one parent to be their sponsor in DEERS.

Dental coverage

Your spouse is also eligible for dental coverage. This isn’t automatically covered in TRICARE medical plans. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Brochure, the TRICARE Dental Program is available for family members of ADSMs and National Guard and Reserve members. In some cases, retirees and their family members may be eligible for dental insurance through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Vision options

Eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can also enroll in a vision plan through FEDVIP. Eligible beneficiaries include:

Active duty family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

When marriage may mean loss of coverage

In some cases, getting married may actually mean that you’ll lose TRICARE eligibility. In the following situations, getting married causes your eligibility to end:

A surviving (widowed) spouse remarries

A former spouse remarries

An adult child using TRICARE Young Adult gets married (unless they marry a service member)

If any of these applies to you or a family member, it’s important to plan ahead. Losing TRICARE eligibility means you’ll need to explore other health coverage options to avoid a gap in care.

Take steps to safeguard your growing family

Over a 15-month period, the medical center performed 78 robotic navigational bronchoscopy procedures, achieving a diagnostic accuracy rate of 91 percent.
This performance places Madigan among the top facilities nationwide using similar technology and exceeds the averages reported in recent studies.
In total, 56 cancer cases were identified, along with several cases involving infection, inflammation, or other non-cancerous conditions.

Over a 15-month period, the medical center performed 78 robotic navigational bronchoscopy procedures, achieving a diagnostic accuracy rate of 91 percent. This performance places Madigan among the top facilities nationwide using similar technology and exceeds the averages reported in recent studies.

A majority of the positive diagnoses made at Madigan during this period were cases of lung cancer. In total, 56 cancer cases were identified, along with several cases involving infection, inflammation, or other non-cancerous conditions. The program’s findings also helped guide decisions about surgical treatment. More than 50 patients were referred for surgery based on the results of their robotic bronchoscopy, and in 44 of those cases, the cancer diagnosis was confirmed after the tissue was removed. This high confirmation rate reflects the accuracy of the robotic system in identifying malignant nodules and ensuring patients receive the right care at the right time.

Several features contribute to the program’s outcomes. The Ion system’s shape-sensing technology enables physicians to precisely navigate to the target area, while rapid on-site evaluation allows pathologists to examine biopsy samples immediately during the procedure. Together, these capabilities help clinicians quickly determine whether enough tissue has been collected, reducing the need for repeat procedures.

With its strong performance, low complication rate, and ability to diagnose and guide treatment in a single visit, Madigan’s Ion program represents a major step forward in lung cancer care within the Military Health System. The early results show that robotic-assisted bronchoscopy can improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection while easing the overall process for patients, offering a promising model for future expansion across military and civilian hospitals alike.

Through Walter’s Way, a new “one-call solution” initiative, patients can reach their care team directly, get advice from a nurse, schedule appointments, and even request prescription renewals, all in one call.

“The idea behind Walter’s Way is putting our patients and their needs first with a one-call solution to take care of their needs,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Simmons, Deputy Director for the Department of Medicine and Primary Care lead for Walter’s Way. “Whether it’s nursing advice, same-day appointments, or medication renewals, we want to go above and beyond for our Walter Reed family.”

Callers reach a staffed line that pairs nurses and medical support assistants (MSAs). The team can schedule well visits, same-day or next-day acute care, check referral status, and begin prescription-renewal processes. Walter’s Way also now includes nurse triage on the initial call, so patients receive clinical guidance immediately.

“Our triage nurses can help determine if any issue can be managed at home, needs medical advice, or requires an in-person or virtual visit,” said Simmons. “It’s all about providing the right care at the right time.”

The Primary Care department, which includes pediatrics, adolescent and young adult medicine (AYA), and internal medicine, now offers expanded hours. Early morning, evenings and Saturday clinics will help patients fit their care into busy schedules. Internal medicine provides virtual Saturday appointments and pediatrics offer early appointments for school-day families and full Saturday clinics.

“We’ve designed our schedule to meet patients where they are. That flexibility is a big part of Walter’s Way,” said Simmons.

The initiative also helps strengthen continuity of care by connecting patients to their primary care team more consistently. The program standardizes triage protocols and ensures that patients are scheduled appropriately for in-person or virtual visits, improving both access and clinical outcomes.

Patients have already noticed the difference. One family praised a Walter’s Way nurse who “went above and beyond to help us get my son scheduled for an appointment.”

The phrase National Guard Substance Abuse Program is often used as a catch-all for the prevention, education, screening, referral, and treatment pathways available to National Guard members who are dealing with alcohol or drug-related concerns.

In real life, it is not always one single, uniform program that looks the same in every unit and every state. It commonly reflects how Guard resources, duty status rules, and clinical care options work together for a particular member at a particular time.

If you are searching for a substance abuse program for National Guard members, the practical answer is that support is usually available. However, the “right” pathway depends on who you are (service member or family), your duty status, and what level of care you need.

Our latest resource from TriCareRehabs.com is here to help you fully understand the landscape involved in what is covered for both National Guard members and their families when it comes to addiction and mental health treatment.

What is the National Guard Substance Abuse Program?

At its core, the National Guard Substance Abuse Program is a structured approach to reduce risk, identify concerns early, and connect active duty service members to appropriate support.

For some people, that support starts with education, drug abuse prevention, suicide prevention, or a brief intervention. For others, it includes clinical evaluation and engagement in national guard substance abuse treatment that matches the severity of the issue and the realities of military life.

An important detail for many Guardsmen is that treatment may occur in civilian settings. National Guard members live and work in their communities, so care is often delivered by licensed civilian providers even when the Guard is involved in referral, coordination, or readiness considerations.

Who Is Eligible for National Guard Substance Abuse Program Support?

Eligibility is often broad, but the route into services can vary based on the service component and individual circumstances. In general, any National Guard member who has concerns about alcohol or drug use, impairment, or related consequences may be able to access screening, referral guidance, or treatment coordination through Guard channels.

Eligibility and Duty Status: Title 10, Title 32, and Drilling Status

Duty status matters because it can determine which policies apply and which systems you are operating within. This is one reason online answers can sound inconsistent.

Two people can ask the same question and get two different correct answers if their duty statuses are different.

Family Members and Dependents

Families often want to know whether they can access help through the same “program.” Guard-facing programs tend to focus on the service member, but family members may have access to separate support resources.

In some situations, family involvement may also be clinically appropriate within the service member’s treatment plan.

Confidentiality and Command Involvement

Many Guardsmen hesitate because they worry that asking for help automatically becomes a disciplinary matter. How confidentiality works depends on the type of service being used (non-medical counseling versus medical treatment), safety requirements, and the policies that apply in your current context.

A useful way to think about it is that different doors have different rules, and part of getting oriented is knowing which door you are walking through.

Are National Guardsmen Covered By ASAP?

The question: Are Guardsmen Covered By ASAP? Comes up frequently because ASAP is a well-known Army framework. The evergreen answer is: it depends on status and context.

Some Guard members may fall under ASAP rules in certain circumstances, while others will follow Guard-specific pathways, state-directed procedures, or civilian clinical systems.

When ASAP May Be the Right Framework

ASAP may be relevant when a Guardsman is operating in an Army active-duty environment or when Army policy is the controlling structure for prevention, drug testing, referral, or rehabilitation processes.

When Guard-Specific Pathways Are More Common

For many drilling members, the pathway may look more like Guard coordination plus civilian clinical care. TriCareRehabs typically frames this point neutrally: the name of the program matters less than identifying which pathway applies to your duty status and location, because that determines what happens next.

What National Guard Substance Abuse Treatment Can Look Like

There is no single template for National Guard substance abuse treatment or for substance-impaired soldiers, but most well-designed pathways include three building blocks: assessment, a level-of-care match, and coordination around real-world obligations.

Screening and Assessment

Treatment commonly begins with an evaluation of drug abuse(frequency, loss of control, risk behaviors), mental health symptoms (such as anxiety, depression, trauma symptoms, or sleep problems), medical considerations, and safety risks.

The goal is to determine what level of care is appropriate and whether additional support at a treatment facility is needed for co-occurring concerns.

Levels of Care and Medical Coverage Basics

When treatment is medically necessary, coverage rules and available services can include inpatient treatment, intensive outpatient services, partial hospitalization, medication-assisted treatment, and withdrawal management (detoxification support).

The appropriate level of care is based on clinical need, not just convenience, and there may be specific rules or limits depending on plan and setting.

Coordinating Care With Drills, Training, and Possible Activation

Guard members have unique scheduling constraints, including drill weekends, annual training, and potential mobilization. Treatment planning sometimes includes practical coordination so care can remain consistent and clinically appropriate even when obligations shift.

Using Support Resources That Are Not Formal Addiction Treatment

Many service members and families benefit from confidential, short-term counseling supports for stress, relationships, reintegration challenges, grief, or parenting pressures that may surround or worsen substance use or other drug abuse.

It is important to understand what these services are and are not.

Non-medical counseling can be helpful for life stressors and navigation, but it is not the same as clinical substance use disorder treatment and is not designed to replace it, nor does it serve as a drug abuse deterrence when a person is actively struggling.

Get Substance Abuse Support in the Guard Today

A National Guard Substance Abuse Program is best understood as coordinated pathways that help National Guard members access education, screening, referral support, and National Guard substance abuse treatment when needed.

The question: Are Guardsmen Covered By ASAP? Does not have one universal answer, because duty status and service context can determine which policy framework applies.

What remains consistent is that there are usually multiple avenues for support, and the most clinically sound approach is to match the level of care to the seriousness of need while accounting for the realities of Guard service.

We know this can sound daunting, which is why TriCareRehabs.com offers confidential placement support for guardsmen at some of the top facilities nationwide that offer accredited support programs to support sustainable recovery.

All calls are confidential, so please reach out for trusted TRICARE treatment options now.
