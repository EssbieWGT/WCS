The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr.

Capturing the patient experience PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments.
The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels.","The Defense Health Agency implemented a new system for patient advocates to track and manage patient feedback across the Military Health System.

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr. Gabrielle Crane, chief of the patient experience branch at DHA.

The primary goal of PAART is to use patient feedback provided to drive improvements within military hospitals and clinics, Crane said. The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.

""It's standardized and consistent,"" she explained. ""The old process was fragmented within each MTF, and patient advocates had differing processes for how they managed feedback. The new system is exciting because now it will be streamlined and provide transparency enterprise-wide.""

For military hospital and clinic leadership, PAART will provide data across the MHS and make better decisions to ensure data-driven improvements — ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience and safety.

At the core of the new platform are the patient advocates who help patients navigate the MHS.

“An advocate is the shipmate, the battle buddy, and the wingman,"" said Crane. “PAART enables an advocate to document interactions and ensure warm handoffs and transfers to the appropriate person who can provide service recovery.""

Capturing the patient experience

PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments. Advocates can select preestablished fields including case date, type, location, and patient category.

The system categorizes cases by severity, which dictates the timeline for resolution:

Emergent cases, posing an immediate threat to life or safety, are flagged for immediate action.

Urgent cases, with a significant impact on health, have a 24-hour response time.

Routine cases are to be completed within 10 business days.

Crane noted PAART’s technology will flag cases to ensure meeting those windows, giving leaders ""at each level an awareness of those timelines and where we are in meeting them.""

The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels. Using the PAART system is mandatory for patient advocates — and a vital measure of effectiveness. PAART data can be used to analyze patient feedback and identify common trends, which ultimately assist in developing solutions as well as inform training programs for military hospital and clinic staff. The portal enables advocates to inform supervisors or military hospital and clinic leadership of concerns expressed by patients in their local area.

""It will allow us to see how we're doing across the entire system,"" Crane said. ""We will be able to identify which areas we can work on or which areas we can leverage and are doing well. We can learn best practices and incorporate those best practices across our system.""

Improving patient experience through PAART

Crane said the new system ""allows transparency at all levels: at the MTF level, at the network level, and at headquarters.”

Through centralizing feedback, the DHA aims to foster a ""culture of continuous improvement,"" Crane said. She noted the system strengthens trust by showing patients that the DHA created it with them in mind: When feedback goes into a system where it can be tracked, trended, and escalated, it counters the feeling that a complaint ""goes nowhere.""

""This was designed with the patient at the center of everything we're doing,"" she added, “we want to make sure that our patients’ voices are being heard and that they're being provided with the appropriate service recovery. That is what’s necessary to ensure the patient journey and experience is where it needs to be.”

Safeguards are in place to protect patient confidentiality. All users of PAART must complete Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training, and patients can choose not to provide certain demographic information if they feel uncomfortable.

Looking ahead, Crane envisions technology will always evolve and that ""we are here to ensure that our patient advocates at the MTFs have the tools, resources, and training that they need to successfully complete their job and be the advocate our beneficiaries deserve.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9463019.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-26 13:56:28.667597

His insights into the program’s funding mechanisms and his understanding of the demographics associated with the current and future participants in this critical senior program were the origin of Association’s position, resulting in the AMAC Social Security Guarantee.

The Social Security Guarantee (SSG) has undergone several iterations since its 2014 creation, each time adjusting the components to accommodate evolving conditions. Most recently, AMAC convened a dedicated working group to evaluate Social Security’s worsening financial trajectory and recommend changes to the SSG that would lead to its preservation and its modernization to meet the challenges of 21st Century economics. This process examined many proposed solutions presented in recent Trustees Reports and selected the alternatives felt to be best suited to save Social Security’s retirement trust fund. These proposals have been combined with our own research to achieve what we believe to be the best path to long-term trust fund solvency without the necessity of tax increases.

A summary of the current AMAC Social Security Guarantee can be viewed on the AMAC.us website. The full SSG research paper and recommendations can be downloaded from that site.

In 2013, AMAC—The Association of Mature American Citizens—took a big step with the creation of the AMAC Foundation, Inc., a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit entity designed to serve Americans. The Foundation’s mission is to help protect and ensure the financial security, health, and social lives of current and future mature Americans, and to help Americans navigate the bewildering array of decisions they need to make.

The Foundation’s projects and plans include providing factual information that improves understanding of the positive value of Social Security and Medicare and the current and long-term challenges these programs face, as well as providing interpretations by Certified Social Security Advisors through AMAC publications, workshops, webinars, podcasts, and telephone support.

In addition, the Foundation serves all Americans in a variety of capacities, including provision of a source of education on the principles of American Free Enterprise, long-term retirement financial planning, and preparing for life—and potential employment—after retirement.

Back to top Sources [1] nida.nih.gov [2] www.tricare.mil [3] www.tricare.mil [4] www.tricare.mil","Substance abuse is a common issue among active soldiers and veterans. The stress and trauma that are part of military life can often cause personnel to turn to drugs or alcohol. Studies have shown that one in ten veterans are diagnosed with substance use disorder, a slightly higher proportion than the general population [1]. In an attempt to aid the recovery of military personnel and veterans, and help them and their families lead healthy, productive lives, the government established Tricare insurance. Tricare offers multi-tiered coverage for medical treatment for active military, veterans and their dependents. In this article, Avenues Recovery shares guidance on eligibility and treatment options covered by Tricare, including Tricare substance abuse coverage.

What Treatment Types Does Tricare Cover?

Included in the long list of Tricare-covered treatment are the following [2]:

Applied Behavior Analysis

Autism Spectrum Disorder

Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy

Collateral Visits

Drug Testing

Eating Disorder Treatment

Electroconvulsive Therapy

Family Therapy

Gender Dysphoria

Intensive Outpatient Programs

Inpatient Hospital Services (emergency and non-emergency)

Management of Withdrawal Symptoms (Detoxification)

Medication Assisted Treatment

Office Based Opioid Treatment

Opioid Treatment Programs

Partial Hospitalization program

Psychoanalysis

Psychological Testing

Psychotherapy

Psychotropic Drugs

Residential Treatment Facility Care

Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Therapeutic Services

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

Conditions such as PTSD, depression, and all forms of addictions are covered by Tricare plans as well.

Locations for Tricare Insurance

Tricare is available across the globe [3]. Its management is split into three different regions.

Tricare West includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa (excludes Rock Island arsenal area), Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri (except St. Louis area), Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas (southwestern corner including El Paso), Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

Tricare healthcare plans in this region are administered by Health Net. This means that Health Net serves as the contractor to the government to provide access and benefits to the end users, in this case active military personnel, veterans, and their dependents. They provide networks, claims processing, and education.

Tricare East includes, Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa (Rock Island area), Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri (St. Louis area), New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas (excluding El Paso area), Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

The contracting partner for the eastern region is Humana Military.

Anywhere outside the United States is called the overseas region, and is managed by International SOS.

Tricare Plans and Eligibility

Tricare offers several different plans, each with unique eligibility, benefits and costs. A common question we get asked is “does Tricare cover therapy for dependants of military personnel?”, and the answer is yes. Returned soldiers often have emotional scars that affect those they live with, in many cases to the extent that family members of veterans require therapy themselves.

Tricare Prime

Who can enroll?

Active military personnel and family members

Retired military veterans and dependents (until eligibility for Medicare is reached)

Those who have received the Medal of Honor and families

Activated members of the National Guard, and in some cases Reserve and Retired personnel.

Former spouses who fill specific qualifications.

Any member of Prime on active duty as well as their families have zero out-of pocket costs. All others are subject to nominal enrollment fees and co-pays.

Tricare Select

Select is accessible in the U.S. and is a fee-for-service program. All above-mentioned members are eligible, excluding those on active duty. Out-of-pockets costs will include annual deductibles and some cost sharing. This varies according to each client’s military status.

Select can be a great option for those who have supplemental insurance to Tricare, like Medicare or commercial insurance from their workplace, or people who are happy with their current healthcare situation and don’t want to change to an in-network Tricare provider.

In order to confirm your eligibility and registration, connect with a preferred Tricare addiction treatment center. Because Avenues Recovery is one of the Tricare-approved rehab facilities, we are authorized to provide Tricare benefits and can get you properly set up right away. Our staff will navigate the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) [4], get you registered, and connect with your Primary Care Physician (PCPM) to arrange necessary referrals. All you have to do is give us a call, and we will take care of the rest!

Variations of these two main plans include:

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

TRICARE Select Overseas

TRICARE For Life

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

TRICARE Young Adult

Tricare Substance Abuse Coverage

People receiving addiction treatment services from an approved provider such as Avenues Recovery can often receive Tricare substance abuse coverage. Medications and care for detox and residential treatment are all part of Tricare benefits. Furthermore, once a member is enrolled in Tricare-approved drug rehab programs like inpatient rehab and Partial Hospitalization Programs, drug and alcohol detox services may be included as well.

Does Tricare Cover Inpatient Rehab?

Yes! As long as you have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD), are dealing with withdrawal symptoms requiring medical attention, and are having difficulties coping with daily routines, residential treatment is absolutely necessary and covered by your Tricare plans. This falls under emergency treatment.

In the event of non-emergency addiction treatment, such as when a person feels the need for treatment on his own, he must be authorized by Tricare or its managing partner. Avenues can help facilitate those authorizations upon contact from the client seeking addiction treatment.

Does Tricare Cover Outpatient Programs?

When qualifying, Tricare will give coverage for many types of outpatient treatments . Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) and PHP are often eligible. There are many individuals who while not needing round the clock medical care and supervision, greatly benefit from treatment groups and counseling sessions offered by Tricare preferred providers. The flexibility of such treatment gives clients the chance to resume their daily routines, family responsibility and jobs while remaining under the care of addiction treatment facilities. In some cases, Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is necessary and covered as well.

Can Veterans Affairs Beneficiaries Access Tricare?

The Department of Veterans Affairs is a cabinet-level agency tasked with providing benefits and and support for military veterans in their time after service. The VA provides health care through its medical facilities and clinics across the country. Since 1995, every Veterans Affairs’ health care facility has been part of the Tricare network [5]. This means that they are able to service all Tricare members, including Active Duty personnel, retirees and their families on a space available basis. This is true for both primary and specialty care.

Tricare Addiction Treatment at Avenues Recovery

At Avenues Recovery, the gratitude we feel towards military personnel who have sacrificed greatly to protect us is endless. We will leave no stone unturned to place the chance for a normal, productive life within your reach without any financial hardship.

Dependents enroll for optional vision and dental coverage (FEDVIP—same plans offered to all federal employees and federal/military retirees).","Google whatever you’re looking for coverage for “tricare + whatever” and it is helpful. There’s 2 forms of tricare. Prime and select. She has to have select to for sure go off post and not need referrals. Some bases send civilians out off post with prime but not everyone so it’s not guaranteed. Google tricare select costs. You’ll find it’s substantially cheaper than most civilian plans. Glasses are not covered by medical coverage but that’s standard for most civilian plans too. She’ll need to enroll in vision insurance. It’s a small fee per month. She’ll also have to enroll in the tricare dental plan separately which is also a small fee a month. You can Google tricare dental plan united Concordia to see a breakdown of their coverage. There’s no premiums for active duty dependents and the deductible is Pennies compared to most of my friends civilian deductibles. Tricare covers most medically necessary things as long as there’s proper documentation.

You can enroll her in Tricare Select and she can go to any in network provider without a referral (some things still need prior authorization though). Active duty SMs/families have an annual $1,000 catastrophic cap, so you’ll never pay more than that for healthcare in a calendar year. My wife dropped her workplace coverage when we got married and did not regret it.

Dependents enroll for optional vision and dental coverage (FEDVIP—same plans offered to all federal employees and federal/military retirees).

You can find info on literally any question she has by googling Tricare + XYZ (like the other commenter said).",,N,0.0,2026-01-24 16:56:22.378076
