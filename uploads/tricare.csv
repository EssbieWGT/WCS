Hightower serves as the director for patient’s access to care at the 42nd MDG.

""Both of my jobs go hand in hand with ensuring medical readiness of our active duty and ensuring the care of their loved ones.""","Emily Hightower, a civilian employee with the 42nd Medical Group and a captain in the Air Force Reserve's 908th Aeromedical Staging Squadron, has been recognized as the 42nd Air Base Wing’s Crusader of the Month for June 2025.

Hightower serves as the director for patient’s access to care at the 42nd MDG. In this role, she provides administrative direction for primary and specialty care clinics, evaluating performance trends and business practices to improve healthcare delivery. As a reservist with the 908th ASTS, she coordinates health services for the 908th Flying Training Wing, overseeing operations and readiness.

""I enjoy knowing that my work contributes to positively impact our patients,"" Hightower said. ""Both of my jobs go hand in hand with ensuring medical readiness of our active duty and ensuring the care of their loved ones.""

Hightower's career began in aeromedical evacuation, inspired by her grandfather, a wounded Army Ranger who was medically airlifted during the Vietnam War. She later became an instructor flight medic, and followed in her mother's footsteps by commissioning as a Medical Service Corps officer after earning her master’s in business administration.

A memorable moment for Hightower was when the 42nd MDG received recognition from the Defense Health Agency for its access to care standards, achieved even with two primary care managers deployed.

""Facilitating teamwork in an already stressful environment is my most proud moment,"" she said.

Originally from Columbus, Georgia, but raised in Opelika, Alabama, Hightower enjoys cooking, baking, and crafting. A mother to a 9-year-old athlete, she often creates items for his team and enjoys attending sporting events, particularly those involving the University of Alabama.

Hightower credits her children and husband for her daily motivation. Her mother, a former enlisted member of the 25th Aerial Port Squadron at Maxwell, who became a nurse practitioner and officer, serves as a role model.

""I am always following in her footsteps to be the best version of myself so I am the best mom I can be for my kids,"" Hightower said. ""She has shown us what hard work and sacrifice looks like while also being the best mom.""

Emphasizing the importance of teamwork, Hightower advises those starting in her field to be patient, innovative, and collaborative. ""Never work alone, and always seek help and assistance,"" she said. ""Stay open-minded, and don't let failed attempts stop you from getting better and achieving your goals. Find a new way to accomplish them.""","https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/17/PMOY/85254484007-250702-fuq-9301003.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x0,y156&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,0.0,2025-07-26 14:56:12.486307

https://zepbound.lilly.com/weight/how-to-use I suggest you reread the package insert and injection directions before shots #2 and #3.
The general consensus is that the thigh might reduce side effects, if the stomach or arm bother you.","That's fantastic! So exciting to get that approval!

Yes, your sleep apnea probably was the final factor. I don't have the link to the Tricare approval form readily available, but they've got a decision chart to determine eligibility.

I'm not sure what I'd do with the compound. Hmmm. Make note of the expiration date; it's probably 9+ months out. You might use it if you have problems with the pharmacy being slow to fill, but the Zepbound supply is pretty solid right now. I guess I'd just treat it like an insurance policy -- glad you have it, hope you never need it. And be thankful if you only ever need the one order!

When to inject: I've done morning, afternoon, and evening; I have no preference or difference in side effects. I've mainly stuck with Fridays, but have taken it between Thursday and Sunday depending on travel or events or other factors. The paper insert in your box will tell you about shifting shot day. (Basically, every 7 days, but no closer than 72 hours. Just stick with 6-8 days as much as possible, and you should be fine.)

I took mine on a Friday, so I would have Saturday and Sunday to deal with any side effects. My most noticable one was achy shoulders for 2 days, just with that first shot. Many people never have side effects, and most that do have some are able to manage them well with OTC meds and/or dietary changes.

FDA insert: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/217806Orig1s020lbl.pdf

Re exercise: Add movement that's safe and enjoyable when you're able. Don't over do it. If you're tired, take a day or two off. Or more; some people get a little fatigued. But other people get energized; that's been a ""side effect"" for my friend on Zepbound, but not for me, lol.

I think that's what I've got for your questions. Here are some of my other top tips:

Read the FAQ and the Beginner’s Guide; there’s a lot of great info there. https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/wiki/index/faq/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/wiki/index/beginners-guide/

The Beginner's Guide has a great spreadsheet, with a page for measurements. Take measurements, and take pics; they'll help you see/quantify progress when the scale or mirror aren't showing you what you want. Pics can go in a Locked or Private album if you don't want them in your main camera roll.

If you’re interested in free mail-back sharps containers, request one here -- https://www.pureway.com/novocare-rx-system-request-page -- select “1.2 gallon sharps disposal system.” You can also check https://med-project.org for free mail-back sharps containers.

Watch for NSVs -- non-scale victories. It's exciting when clothes start getting loose, you can get off the floor easily, don't need a seatbelt extender on an airplane, etc.

You and your dr should be on the same page re titration (stepping up in strength). Here's the prescribing info: ""With multiple options, you and your doctor can work together to find the once-weekly dose of Zepbound that fits your body's changing needs. Zepbound dosing is increased gradually over time. You’ll begin treatment at a recommended 2.5 mg starting dose. After 4 weeks, your doctor will increase your dose to 5 mg. Your doctor may increase the dosage in 2.5 mg increments after at least 4 weeks on the current dose until recommended maintenance dosage is achieved.” Going up after 5.0 is a ""may,"" not a ""will"" -- many people find a ""sweet spot"" dosage below 15 that works for months. https://zepbound.lilly.com/weight/how-to-use

I suggest you reread the package insert and injection directions before shots #2 and #3. Some people forget to remove the gray pen cap for their second or third dose, and it is SAD to waste a dose. I take a look at the needle tip as verification that I've removed the cap. :) (Not an issue with the vials, of course.)

Lilly has great videos teaching how to use the pen and the vials. https://zepbound.lilly.com/support-resources

Here’s the Instructions For Use, with pics on how to inject: https://pi.lilly.com/us/zepbound-pen-us-ifu.pdf

Here's one way to do the back of your arm yourself: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T26Wmg9_EFw -- I also just kind of ""hug"" myself to reach the back of my arm, but that depends on your range of motion.

You can try all the injection sites and see what you think. I've tried them all with no significant difference. The general consensus is that the thigh might reduce side effects, if the stomach or arm bother you. And the arm is kinda inconvenient, lol. But see what you like.

,,2025-07-26 09:32:46+00:00,Catalunya Diari EN,Official: This SSA update on Medicare catches the attention of many Americans - Catalunya Diari,Another Take,,,,,https://catalunyadiari.com/en/news/demonstrated-progress-ssa-tricare-medical-care-program,"Through new announcements, the agency points out that Tricare is not exclusive to active military members, but also covers retirees, family members, National Guard members, and Social Reservists.
Conditions to meet to access Tricare The SSA clarifies that, upon turning 65 years old, military retirees must enroll in Medicare Part A and B to keep their Tricare active (known as Tricare For Life).
When both programs cover the same service, Medicare pays first and Tricare covers the remainder.
The SSA has started to actively inform about how Tricare can be integrated with Medicare.
Tricare expands coverage: there are services covered that Medicare doesn't offer, and Tricare can cover copays or additional expenses.","The Social Security Administration (SSA) in the United States has led a major advancement in the information they provide about a program that interests many citizens. This advancement is generating relief and satisfaction among thousands of Americans.

In essence, the SSA is promoting greater awareness of the real meaning of Tricare, how it works, and who can be beneficiaries. Through new announcements, the agency points out that Tricare is not exclusive to active military members, but also covers retirees, family members, National Guard members, and Social Reservists.

Important message from the SSA: everything you need to know about Tricare

Tricare, managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), provides comprehensive medical care: doctors, hospitals, mental health, pharmacy services, and even vaccines, including against flu and shingles. This allows many families in the military community to access a level of care similar to Medicare, but with extensive additional coverage.

The program is aimed at several categories: active duty armed forces personnel, retirees with or without 65 years old, their spouses, children, and survivors. It also covers National Guard members and Reservists.

Conditions to meet to access Tricare

The SSA clarifies that, upon turning 65 years old, military retirees must enroll in Medicare Part A and B to keep their Tricare active (known as Tricare For Life). If they don't do so, they may face penalties and lose medical coverage.

This requirement is vital: without enrollment in Medicare B, Tricare will become a secondary payer, and some services could be out of reach. When both programs cover the same service, Medicare pays first and Tricare covers the remainder.

The SSA has started to actively inform about how Tricare can be integrated with Medicare. They have published guides in Spanish and conduct educational campaigns so beneficiaries understand their benefits. This way, they explain the exact meaning of access and the necessary conditions, avoiding confusion and mistakes in enrollment dates.

Why should you consider this option?

Tricare expands coverage: there are services covered that Medicare doesn't offer, and Tricare can cover copays or additional expenses. Having both programs reduces direct costs for the beneficiary and it's vital to meet the conditions and avoid losing access due to delays or lack of knowledge.

For families with a military connection, this can mean access to high-quality medical care, without surprises or unexpected costs. It's thanks to better information from the SSA that many people are discovering this double coverage they can have without excessive expenses.",https://catalunyadiari.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/estados-unidos-seguridad-social-jubilado_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-07-26 14:56:16.153690

Legislation would save an estimated 350,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in health care costs

Today, Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) alongside Representatives Pat Ryan (D-NY-18) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA-2) reintroduced the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan legislation that would extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old. This would lower health care costs and guarantee access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country.

“As a Navy combat veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices military families make,” said Sen. Kelly. “They’ve earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect. That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently. This common-sense fix will raise the age limit, allowing military dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance plan until 26, the same age as civilians, without a premium increase,” said Sen. Murkowski. “Taking care of our servicemembers means taking care of their families, and this bill takes a critical step in fulfilling that responsibility.”

“Military families shouldn’t have inferior rights. Our government should recognize their sacrifices by giving their children access to high-quality, affordable health care up to age 26, instead of kicking them off their parents’ insurance plans early,” said Sen. Warren. “All three of my brothers served in the military, so I will always fight for the safety and well-being of our service members and their families.”

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” said Rep. Ryan. “I’m proud that my legislation will right this wrong, and – especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide – will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. By extending TRICARE eligibility to 26, hundreds of thousands of military families will save as much as $8,724 per year. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” said Rep. Kiggans. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

“Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families. A key part of that effort is making TRICARE a competitive, modern health benefit that supports both recruiting and retention,” said Military Officers Association of America President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret). “The post-9/11 generation of military kids are now approaching adulthood. While media coverage of emotional homecomings offered a glimpse into their sacrifices, it barely scratched the surface of the unique challenges they faced. It’s time to honor these sacrifices by ensuring young adults from military families have the same health care protections as their civilian peers. MOAA thanks Congressman Pat Ryan for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act that would align TRICARE with federal requirements for commercial health plans. We appreciate his leadership and are committed to supporting this important effort.”

“Our young adult military kids deserve the same access to healthcare as civilians their age,” said National Military Family Association CEO Besa Pinchotti. “They’ve grown up through two decades of war, combat deployments, and operational tempos that took one or both parents away on a regular basis. We’ve asked them to move every two to three years, start new schools, and make new friends. Many have stepped into caregiving roles as Hidden Helpers. They’ve done everything the country has asked of them — the least we can do is ensure they have the same access to affordable healthcare as their peers.”

“Gold Star Spouses of America strongly supports the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act to end the unjust TRICARE premium requirement for military families with young adult children,” said Gold Star Spouses of America National President Tamra Sipes. “Our military kids already shoulder the weight of sacrifice, and they should never pay extra for the same health care access their civilian peers receive without added cost. This bipartisan fix is long overdue.”

“Our military families should not be asked to accept less than what’s standard in the private sector. The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act promotes fairness and strengthens readiness by ensuring dependents can stay on TRICARE until age 26 without extra cost. AFSA is proud to support this bill,” said Keith A. Reed, Chief Executive Officer, Air Force Sergeants Association.

“The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) is grateful to Representatives Ryan and Higgins and Senators Kelly and Murkowski for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS President and Founder. “By extending TRICARE eligibility up to age 26, thousands of military dependents and surviving children will be ensured access to health care and critical mental health care, saving military and surviving families nearly $8,000 per child each year. We urge Congress to pass this important bipartisan bill!”

Background:

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21 years old. If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first.

Dependents have the option to enroll in the TRICARE Young Adult program, and nearly 33,000 military families choose to do so. However, they must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium, in a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets.

The counties affected are Piute and Sevier.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator at https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

Company Overview

PRIME exits and American HealthCare Capital are pleased to introduce a DME/HME company for sale with multiple locations throughout the US. The company was established over 25 years ago. Most of their locations are on army bases in 6 states, plus they have several Midwest retail locations.

The company has virtually no competitors within the Army bases. Their primary payer is Tricare. Under our current government administration, further growth is anticipated due to potential expansion of Tricare for army on bases.

Financial Overview

The breakdown of revenue by product is as follows: 64% CPAP, 17% Breast and Maternity needs, 11% Mobility Needs, 7% Compression needs, and 3%-5% Home Care needs.

The company’s gross revenue for 2023 was $5,257,336 with EBITDA of $2,550,287. The Revenue for 2024 was $7,042,919 with EBITDA of $1,963,913. Approximately 90% of their highly profitable business is from Tricare with a very small amount of Medicare. If a new owner were to focus on additional payers, and making delivery on bases, their revenue and profit could increase dramatically.

Staff Overview

The company owner, operator, and administrator will stay to advise the company for 6 months after the sale.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.","JULY 25, 2025 – Whether you need to make an appointment, check a claim, or download forms, knowing where to log in can make using your TRICARE benefits easier. Today’s Military Health System relies on multiple online platforms—each with a specific purpose. Understanding them, and how they’re evolving, can help you make the most of your health coverage.

Keep in mind: TRICARE doesn’t own these platforms. Other agencies or contractors do. But you can visit the TRICARE All Logins page for a comprehensive list.

Here’s what to know.

One healthcare system, several portals

There’s no single portal that does it all. Instead, different login platforms support different parts of your benefit. Generally, they fall into three categories:

Updating personal information and enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System

Getting care at military hospitals and clinics with MHS GENESIS

Getting civilian care through a TRICARE contractor

Here’s a look at each.

DEERS and milConnect/Beneficiary Web Enrollment

DEERS is the foundation of TRICARE eligibility. The milConnect website lets you update contact information, check your enrollment status, and access Beneficiary Web Enrollment tools. You can use this platform to:

Enroll in or change TRICARE plans

Update contact information, like your address or phone number

milConnect now uses myAuth, a new user-friendly secure login that is gradually replacing DS Logon. Keep reading to learn more about myAuth.

MHS GENESIS Patient Portal

If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal is your main access point. You can:

View laboratory results

Request prescription refills

Make appointments

Send secure messages

You may also view your health records and appointment notes from military hospitals and clinics.

Regional contractor portals

Health care outside of military hospitals and clinics is administered by TRICARE contractors. Each has its own portal:

TRICARE East Region: Humana Military

TRICARE West Region: TriWest Healthcare Alliance

TRICARE Overseas: International SOS

TRICARE For Life (in all regions): WPS Military and Veterans Health

Use these portals to:

View claims

Check referrals

Find network providers

Pharmacy login

Express Scripts is the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor. Through their portal, you can switch eligible medications to TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and:

Request new prescriptions

Refill prescriptions

Track your order status

Pay bills

Dental login

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? If so, United Concordia is your TRICARE dental contractor. Your United Concordia TDP My Account lets you:

View plan coverage details

Check claims history

View your dental explanation of benefits

Pay bills

What is myAuth?

myAuth is a new secure login option replacing DS Logon across Department of Defense systems. With myAuth, you can use your Common Access Card or a username/password, plus a secure multi-factor authentication method. This lets you access multiple DOD websites with just one login.

Currently, myAuth is used on:

milConnect

ID Card Office Online

Over time, all DOD systems that use DS Logon will transition to myAuth. Until then, platforms may use either DS Logon or myAuth depending on their system. (Note: You must have an active DS Logon account to create a new myAuth account.)

Civilian health portals

If you see a civilian provider, your provider may use an electronic health record, or EHR, other than MHS GENESIS. The DOD doesn’t own these other EHRs. You’ll need to follow your provider’s instructions to sign in and view records or communicate with providers.

Bottom line

Managing your TRICARE benefit means knowing which login to use—and when. While it may seem complex, here’s a breakdown:

Use milConnect for enrollment and DEERS updates.

Use MHS GENESIS to see your records for care at military hospitals and clinics.

Use your TRICARE contractor’s portal to manage claims, view referrals, and pay bills.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.

Remember: myAuth is coming, bringing with it a more unified login experience. Until then, save the portals you use most, keep your passwords safe, and check back for updates as the rollout continues.

The visit, part of Ferrara’s broader effort to engage directly with frontline military and civilian medical teams, marked a significant opportunity to connect senior leadership — based in the Pentagon and more than 4,000 miles away from JBER — with operational health care.
He also engaged in focused discussions on collaborative-care models, innovations in integrated military-civilian health care, and support for Alaska communities.
“First of all, we must be laser-focused on our readiness mission,” Ferrara said.
Ferrara commended the team’s commitment to innovation, readiness, and patient-centered care in one of the most geographically challenging environments in the Military Health System.","Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for Health Affairs, paid a visit to the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson hospital to see firsthand the delivery of healthcare services to service members, veterans, and their families across JBER, Alaska, on July 16, 2025.

The JBER hospital is a Department of Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs joint venture hospital led by the 673d Medical Group. The visit, part of Ferrara’s broader effort to engage directly with frontline military and civilian medical teams, marked a significant opportunity to connect senior leadership — based in the Pentagon and more than 4,000 miles away from JBER — with operational health care.

Ferrara said this type of visit allows him to see what’s happening on the ground. It also allows him to hear directly from the staff doing the work — what’s working, what’s challenging — so he can better support them at the senior leadership level.

“I try to get out to the field as much as I can because having a boot on the ground, a firsthand look is the best way to understand what happens across the Military Health System,” Ferrara said. “We’re a very large and diverse healthcare system … the mission and geography can be unique. I talk to people doing the work and I get to understand what it is about both the operational unit they are supporting and how they integrate within the community.”

He also stressed his three priorities, or the three “Ss” —support, sustain, and strengthen.

“We support the war fighter — that’s our number one priority,” Ferrara said, “We’re the only healthcare system in America that goes to war, so we must be ready to do that. We must ensure our warfighters are ready to fight tonight and our medical professionals are prepared to follow them into battle and deliver world-class care. Sustain–we must maintain and build on our skills using high-volume, high-complexity clinical material and exposure to keep our teams functioning at their best. Military medicine has a proud legacy and it’s our duty to carry that forward — whether it’s for two years or 25. And strengthen — we must continuously replenish our force with talented medical professionals, from enlisted to officers, to ensure we can carry out the mission now and into the future.”

Throughout the day, Ferrara toured the facility, met with clinical staff and support teams, and received in-depth briefings on the group’s readiness, patient care programs, and quality-improvement initiatives. He also engaged in focused discussions on collaborative-care models, innovations in integrated military-civilian health care, and support for Alaska communities.

“First of all, we must be laser-focused on our readiness mission,” Ferrara said. “When a service member deploys from JBER, they need full confidence that their family will be taken care of while they are executing their combat mission — because that peace of mind directly impacts mission success. You all provide a critical function and service in support of the warfighter. Don’t ever forget that.”

Ferrara, who has experience in both military and civilian healthcare systems, understands firsthand the high demands and the need to work long hours. He emphasized the importance of not only maintaining clinical excellence, but also investing in the people behind the mission. One of the initiatives they are currently working on is electronic health records.

“Now that MHS GENESIS is completely rolled out, we’re hoping to launch within the next year an AI program called Ambient Listening,” the U.S. Navy veteran said. “This will restore the patient and physician relationship. The staff can talk to the patient like in the old days, and the AI will listen and generate notes, so the provider does not have to sit there and type notes … we are trying to reduce as much administrative burden as possible.”

The 673d Medical Group supports more than 150,000 TRICARE and VA beneficiaries throughout Alaska. Ferrara commended the team’s commitment to innovation, readiness, and patient-centered care in one of the most geographically challenging environments in the Military Health System.

“The partnership [673d MDG] with the VA is really best in class, one of the best collaborative practices,” Ferrara commended. “I did get a much better understanding of how they work with civilian partners here, both in Anchorage, across Alaska, and how they cover this vast territory, twice the size of Texas, with only 10 hospitals in the entire state. You have to be matrixed to be able to provide care across this vast area.”

To understand the scope, he mentioned the hospital can easily move patients to the next level of higher care; those partnerships are a force multiplier enhanced by having strong DOD, VA, and civilian partnerships.

What stood out to him most? He paused and smiled. “It’s their spirit. Their professionalism. Their ability to support both readiness and humanity.”

His message to the clinical staff was simple.

“Bravo Zulu,” he said. “That’s Navy talk for ‘well done.’ And they deserve it.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-07-25 15:56:14.723245

Legislation would save an estimated 367,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in health care costs

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Pat Ryan – an Iraq War veteran, member of the House Armed Services Committee, and the first West Point graduate to represent the Academy in Congress – announced the re-introduction of his bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act.” This landmark legislation would extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old, lowering costs and ensuring access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” said Congressman Pat Ryan. “I’m proud that my legislation will right this wrong, and – especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide – will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. By extending TRICARE eligibility to 26, hundreds of thousands of military families will save as much as $8,724 per year. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

Congressman Ryan’s “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” is bipartisan and bicameral. Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (R-VA) is leading the House introduction alongside Congressman Ryan, and Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are leading the Senate introduction.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” said Rep. Jen Kiggans. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”

“As a Navy combat veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices military families make,” said Senator Kelly. “They’ve earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect. That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently. This common-sense fix will raise the age limit, allowing military dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance plan until 26, the same age as civilians, without a premium increase,” said Senator Murkowski. “Taking care of our servicemembers means taking care of their families, and this bill takes a critical step in fulfilling that responsibility.”

“Military families shouldn’t have inferior rights. Our government should recognize their sacrifices by giving their children access to high-quality, affordable health care up to age 26, instead of kicking them off their parents’ insurance plans early,” said Senator Warren. “All three of my brothers served in the military, so I will always fight for the safety and well-being of our service members and their families.”

“Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families. A key part of that effort is making TRICARE a competitive, modern health benefit that supports both recruiting and retention,” said Military Officers Association of America President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret). “The post-9/11 generation of military kids are now approaching adulthood. While media coverage of emotional homecomings offered a glimpse into their sacrifices, it barely scratched the surface of the unique challenges they faced. It’s time to honor these sacrifices by ensuring young adults from military families have the same health care protections as their civilian peers. MOAA thanks Congressman Pat Ryan for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act that would align TRICARE with federal requirements for commercial health plans. We appreciate his leadership and are committed to supporting this important effort.”

“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association. “Military families are paying hundreds of dollars each month to provide health coverage for the young adults in their families, while civilian families face no increase in cost related to age. The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act is a common sense solution, allowing military-connected young adults to keep their TRICARE coverage up to age 26. We appreciate Rep. Ryan’s leadership on this issue and his commitment to making sure military families stay strong and healthy.”

“Gold Star Spouses of America strongly supports the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act to end the unjust TRICARE premium requirement for military families with young adult children,” said Gold Star Spouses of America National President Tamra Sipes. “Our military kids already shoulder the weight of sacrifice, and they should never pay extra for the same health care access their civilian peers receive without added cost. This bipartisan fix is long overdue.”

“Our military families should not be asked to accept less than what’s standard in the private sector. The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act promotes fairness and strengthens readiness by ensuring dependents can stay on TRICARE until age 26 without extra cost. AFSA is proud to support this bill,” said Keith A. Reed, Chief Executive Officer, Air Force Sergeants Association.

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

“The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) is grateful to Representatives Ryan and Higgins and Senators Kelly and Murkowski for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS President and Founder. “By extending TRICARE eligibility up to age 26, thousands of military dependents and surviving children will be ensured access to health care and critical mental health care, saving military and surviving families nearly $8,000 per child each year. We urge Congress to pass this important bipartisan bill!”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21 years old. If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first.

Dependents have the option to enroll in the TRICARE Young Adult program, and nearly 33,000 military families choose to do so. However, they must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium, in a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets.

Congressman Ryan’s legislation would ensure equity for military families by bringing eligibility for young adult dependents in line with that offered by private insurance plans. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), children up to the age of 26 can remain on their parents’ health insurance plans with no additional out of pocket cost.

Congressman Ryan first introduced the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in the 118th Congress. The bill is cosponsored by more than 35 Members of Congress from both parties. The bill is also endorsed by dozens of national organizations who support military families, including the VFW and the National Military Family Association. The full list of endorsing organizations and cosponsors is below.

When multiple insurance plans are in place, it is important to understand the proper billing order. This determines which insurer pays first and which pays last. Below is a breakdown of the correct coordination of benefits (COB) for Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, Indian Health Services (IHS), and employer-sponsored health insurance.

General Order of Insurance Billing

Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance (ESI) – If an individual has coverage through an employer or a spouse's employer, this is generally the primary payer.

Medicare – Medicare will usually pay after employer-sponsored insurance if the employer has more than 20 employees. If the employer has fewer than 20 employees, Medicare may be primary.

TRICARE – TRICARE is typically secondary to most other forms of insurance but will pay before Medicaid and IHS. If the individual is eligible for Medicare, TRICARE acts as a supplement unless the individual is actively employed and covered by ESI.

Indian Health Services (IHS) – IHS is the payer of last resort for enrolled Native Americans unless Medicaid is also involved. If other insurance exists, it must be billed first.

Medicaid – Medicaid is always the last payer and will only pay after all other insurances have processed the claim.

How Each Insurance Type Works Together

Medicare and Employer-Sponsored Insurance:

If the individual is actively working and the employer has 20+ employees, employer insurance pays first, Medicare second.

If the employer has fewer than 20 employees, Medicare pays first.

TRICARE and Medicare:

If eligible for both Medicare and TRICARE, Medicare is primary, and TRICARE for Life (TFL) is secondary.

If the individual is actively working and covered by ESI, the employer plan pays first, Medicare second, and TRICARE last.

Medicare and Medicaid:

Medicare is always the primary payer, and Medicaid only pays after Medicare processes the claim.

Medicaid covers costs like Medicare premiums, copays, and services not covered by Medicare.

TRICARE and Medicaid:

TRICARE always pays before Medicaid. Medicaid will only pay after TRICARE has processed and left an unpaid amount.

Indian Health Services (IHS):

IHS pays only after all other eligible insurances have been billed.

“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said.
“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said.
Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.” Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition.
That’s reality.” Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.","U.S. Army Master Sgt. Jerry Millan lives life by two promises:

“I’m not done yet,” was his vow when Military Health System doctors gave him a lifechanging diagnosis—a rare cancer in his abdominal area, the “most aggressive cancer they've ever come across,” he said. It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.

The second, “I got you,” is his assurance to fellow service members he mentors that he’ll be there to support them and his fellow athletes as they prepare for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games.

Millan’s cancer has been in remission for over five years, and he shares his story of survival to encourage and lift up others facing difficult odds.

A Sudden Pain, A Grim Diagnosis

Millan, a special operations forces soldier, was participating in pre-deployment training in the woods of Fort Polk, Louisiana, when he hit the ground and felt a sharp pain in his gut. He thought it was just a hernia. A medic agreed and ordered a scan. The scan confirmed an umbilical hernia, but the military radiologist saw more.

“I just had this pain in my navel. It wasn’t a typical pain from exercise or indigestion; rather, something unfamiliar” Millan recalled. “But thanks to the radiologist—they saw multiple masses inside my abdomen.”

He was immediately sent to the Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where specialists identified Burkitt’s Lymphoma, an aggressive growing type of cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. He waited with his parents to find out the prognosis.

“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said. “I'm just sitting there looking at like the floor, my dad's sitting at the edge of the bed, and I started saying to myself, ‘I'm not done yet.’”

“It was just a decision to live.”

MHS and NIH Partner to Save his Life

Because Burkitt’s Lymphoma is rare, Walter Reed oncologists quickly linked Millan with doctors and researchers at the NIH who study the disease. The partnership gave him access to an experimental, high-dose chemotherapy protocol for six cycles.

“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said. “At the time, three doctors in network in the United States were trained on that type of cancer.”

Like the cancer, the treatment was aggressive.

“You’re given a massive dose of chemotherapy—I was on a 96-hour drip at first,” he said. “It was the harshest form of chemotherapy that has been developed. But you had to do it because the cancer, by that time, grew over 1000%. My gut was extremely distended.”

Besides the side effects of cancer treatments, he found the isolation to be an additional challenge. He was diagnosed just before the pandemic in 2020. Due to his severely compromised immune system and COVID-19, he was unable to be around people for the better part of a year. On top of that, the unit he trained so hard with deployed without him.

“My friends were deployed; I couldn't see my family. I couldn't have conversations face to face, it was: Wash your hands, wear your face shields, don’t touch each other,” he said.

His mental resilience was one of the key factors to his recovery. Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.”

Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition. They gave his mother a place to stay during treatment, arranged flights, and later linked him to educational resources and a staff position to let him continue serving while he healed.

They made sure his mother could focus on him and not on logistics. “She didn’t have to worry about anything,” Millan said. “She could just focus on me.”

After his chemotherapy rounds, doctors declared him cancer-free.

Finding New Strength Through Sports

Millan looked for what was next and returned to serving—yet struggled to navigate what his new duty looked like while in recovery.

“I felt like they really had no use for me. They had people that were deployable and ready to go. And I can’t. That’s reality.”

Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team. “The Military Adaptive Sports program provided me the opportunity to find a new purpose in life by helping others going through similar situations,” he said. “They helped me find a new community.”

He trained for powerlifting, rowing, sitting volleyball, track and field, and precision air sports. At his first DOD Warrior Games in 2022, he balanced competition with duty, commuting between his events in Orlando and his assignment at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. The camaraderie hooked him. “Once I got to participate and train with the other athletes that were there, I learned about their stories and the things they’re going through,” he said. “It's like, wow, you know, there are other people out there in the military community … that all have their struggles, and they are facing their adversity.”

“Then I ended up finding this new community,” Millan added, “I didn’t realize how badly I needed that.”

He was invited to participate in the 2025 Invictus Games, where he took Gold in rowing. The togetherness, teamwork, and community inspired his second promise.

‘I Got You’

In the 2025 games, Millan will again wear Team SOCOM colors. He qualified for the “Ultimate Champion” category, a grueling slate of every individual event: powerlifting, cycling, swimming, archery, shooting, rowing, track and field, and volleyball. He uses his experience to help service members who are struggling, recruiting new athletes, visiting recovery units, and offering virtual coaching to anyone who needs it. He shares his message of recovery and support to uplift others.

“If you’re a teammate of mine, I got you,” he stresses. “I will come to you and walk you through the things that helped me. I’ll do this with you. I’ll tell them this is what I did that helped me. I didn't follow a guided path. I didn't have someone walking me through it. But if you're in my community … I got you.”

Health and Fitness Key to Recovery

As the WCP-CC East Region noncommissioned officer in charge, he is a liaison to U.S. Army Special Operations Command and visits the Soldier Recovery Unit twice a week. He demonstrates workouts, shares nutrition tips, and, most importantly, listens. “I learn about their stories and the stuff they're going through,” Millan said. “I say, ‘here are the things that helped me to get through what I was going through.’ Maybe what I've learned in my own journey that could possibly help.”

“I just embrace it, and they embrace. That helps amplify any type of recovery,” he added.

To continue to keep his own health in check, he trains. He believes movement builds mood and resilience. A chemotherapy-induced heart issue demands top fitness, so he lifts, rows, and runs often. “To build resilience, you have to build a routine,” he said. “Maybe you start with walking 20 minutes a day. Then it builds from there. Your body is meant to move.” For him, exercise helps his mental health. “My mood and my attitude are directly tied to how I feel.”

Millan maintains annual needed checkups through the care of his MHS team. “I get labs and then I have specialty care for my heart,” he said. “I'm able to use these specialty clinics to help with issues I'm having from chemotherapy right on base.”

Millan refuses to let cancer define him, but it does define his new outlook—living by a new mantra: “There’s more I want to do in life,” he said. “And I’m not done yet.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8874038.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-25 13:56:16.622322

Business Highlights Medicaid Segment Performance: The Medicaid segment experienced a 16% increase in total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.
This was driven by a 33% growth in Marketplace membership, although it was offset by lower Marketplace net risk adjustment revenue.
Medicaid Membership Trends: Medicaid membership decreased due to redeterminations, impacting the overall membership numbers.
This contributed to a 33% increase in Marketplace membership year-over-year.","Centene Corp, a leading multi-national healthcare enterprise, has released its Form 10-Q report for the second quarter of 2025. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and operational highlights, reflecting significant growth in revenues and various strategic business initiatives despite facing some challenges.

Financial Highlights

Total Revenues: $48,742 million, representing a 22% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by premium and membership growth in the PDP business and overall market growth in the Marketplace business.

Gross Margin: $3,018 million, a decrease of 33% compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher medical costs and a reduction in the net 2025 Marketplace risk adjustment transfer estimate.

Earnings (loss) from operations: $(458) million, compared to $1,229 million in the same period in 2024, reflecting increased medical costs and a reduction in Marketplace risk adjustment revenue.

Net earnings (loss) attributable to Centene Corporation: $(253) million, compared to $1,146 million in the same period in 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in the net 2025 Marketplace risk adjustment revenue transfer estimate.

Diluted earnings (loss) per common share: $(0.51), compared to $2.16 in the same period in 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in the net 2025 Marketplace risk adjustment revenue transfer estimate.

Business Highlights

Medicaid Segment Performance: The Medicaid segment experienced a 16% increase in total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by rate increases, although it was partially offset by a decrease in membership due to redeterminations.

Medicare Segment Performance: The Medicare segment saw a 58% increase in total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This was largely due to increased premiums and membership in the PDP business, despite a decline in Medicare Advantage membership.

Commercial Segment Performance: The Commercial segment reported an 18% increase in total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This was driven by a 33% growth in Marketplace membership, although it was offset by lower Marketplace net risk adjustment revenue.

Other Segment Performance: The Other segment's total revenues increased by 1% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. However, the gross margin decreased due to the expiration of the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract in December 2024.

Medicaid Membership Trends: Medicaid membership decreased due to redeterminations, impacting the overall membership numbers. The company continues to work with state partners to adjust rates to match post-redetermination acuity.

Medicare Advantage and PDP Changes: The company recorded a premium deficiency reserve related to the 2025 Medicare Advantage contract year, which was increased during the year based on earnings progression. The PDP membership increased by 19% year-over-year due to strong bid positioning.

Marketplace Expansion: The Marketplace product, Ambetter Health, expanded its geographic footprint by adding 60 new counties across 10 states, including expansion into Iowa. This contributed to a 33% increase in Marketplace membership year-over-year.

Future Medicaid Contracts: The company has secured several future Medicaid contracts, including a new contract in Iowa and a continuation of services in Mississippi, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, with terms ranging from four to eight years.

Regulatory Changes Impact: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and other regulatory changes are expected to impact Medicaid and Marketplace operations, potentially affecting member eligibility and reimbursement models.

Operational Challenges and Initiatives: The company is addressing increased medical cost trends through new clinical initiatives, care management plans, and network design, while also refiling 2026 policy year rates to reflect higher projected Marketplace morbidity.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-25 08:56:06.832514

It is possible to use TFL with a Medicare Advantage Plan though I'm not sure why you would want to do that. The only possibility is you are seeking vision, dental, hearing benefits not covered by TFL.

TFL coupled with original Medicare (Parts A & B) provide some of the best coverage possible - rarely, if ever will you see a bill after a visit to a healthcare provider or a hospital stay. In addition, TFL provides creditable coverage for Part D - Prescription Drug Coverage so you wouldn't need to get that either.

A MAJOR DISADVANTAGE to coupling TFL with a MA plan is the MA claims don’t crossover to Medicare. This means you will have to file claims for reimbursement of TRICARE-covered services - an administrative task that can be a real PIA.

Ok in this regard, and I am speaking general terms here. Remember MA plans replace original medicare. Tricare For Life is the secondary payer so in-network you should be okay depending on if your Kaiser MA is HMO or PPO. It doesn't always reimburse co-pays and deductibles IF you are on a MA plan with TFL. Follow your Kaiser plan and contact them again if believe they do. If you are out of network, you will likely have to file your claims manually AFTER your Advantage Plan makes their coverage decision. At times, you might have to pay more out of pocket.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.","Whether you need to make an appointment, check a claim, or download forms, knowing where to log in can make using your TRICARE benefits easier. Today’s Military Health System relies on multiple online platforms—each with a specific purpose. Understanding them, and how they’re evolving, can help you make the most of your health coverage.

Keep in mind: TRICARE doesn’t own these platforms. Other agencies or contractors do. But you can visit the TRICARE All Logins page for a comprehensive list.

Here’s what to know.

One healthcare system, several portals

There’s no single portal that does it all. Instead, different login platforms support different parts of your benefit. Generally, they fall into three categories:

• Updating personal information and enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System

• Getting care at military hospitals and clinics with MHS GENESIS

• Getting civilian care through a TRICARE contractor

Here’s a look at each.

DEERS and milConnect/Beneficiary Web Enrollment

DEERS is the foundation of TRICARE eligibility. The milConnect website lets you update contact information, check your enrollment status, and access Beneficiary Web Enrollment tools. You can use this platform to:

• Enroll in or change TRICARE plans

• Update contact information, like your address or phone number

milConnect now uses myAuth, a new user-friendly secure login that is gradually replacing DS Logon. Keep reading to learn more about myAuth.

MHS GENESIS Patient Portal

If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal is your main access point. You can:

• View laboratory results

• Request prescription refills

• Make appointments

• Send secure messages

You may also view your health records and appointment notes from military hospitals and clinics.

Regional contractor portals

Health care outside of military hospitals and clinics is administered by TRICARE contractors. Each has its own portal:

• TRICARE East Region: Humana Military

• TRICARE West Region: TriWest Healthcare Alliance

• TRICARE Overseas: International SOS

• TRICARE For Life (in all regions): WPS Military and Veterans Health

Use these portals to:

• View claims

• Check referrals

• Find network providers

Pharmacy login

Express Scripts is the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor. Through their portal, you can switch eligible medications to TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and:

• Request new prescriptions

• Refill prescriptions

• Track your order status

• Pay bills

Dental login

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? If so, United Concordia is your TRICARE dental contractor. Your United Concordia TDP My Account lets you:

• View plan coverage details

• Check claims history

• View your dental explanation of benefits

• Pay bills

What is myAuth?

myAuth is a new secure login option replacing DS Logon across Department of Defense systems. With myAuth, you can use your Common Access Card or a username/password, plus a secure multi-factor authentication method. This lets you access multiple DOD websites with just one login.

Currently, myAuth is used on:

• milConnect

• ID Card Office Online

Over time, all DOD systems that use DS Logon will transition to myAuth. Until then, platforms may use either DS Logon or myAuth depending on their system. (Note: You must have an active DS Logon account to create a new myAuth account.)

Civilian health portals

If you see a civilian provider, your provider may use an electronic health record, or EHR, other than MHS GENESIS. The DOD doesn’t own these other EHRs. You’ll need to follow your provider’s instructions to sign in and view records or communicate with providers.

Bottom line

Managing your TRICARE benefit means knowing which login to use—and when. While it may seem complex, here’s a breakdown:

• Use milConnect for enrollment and DEERS updates.

• Use MHS GENESIS to see your records for care at military hospitals and clinics.

• Use your TRICARE contractor’s portal to manage claims, view referrals, and pay bills.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.

Remember: myAuth is coming, bringing with it a more unified login experience. Until then, save the portals you use most, keep your passwords safe, and check back for updates as the rollout continues.

The provisions could have a lasting effect on the lives of perhaps several thousand current and former Defense Department personnel — both uniformed and civilian — as well as veterans and their families.

And if last year’s House debate on the NDAA is prologue, partisan wrangling over the issue could complicate lawmakers’ chances of clearing that key national security bill for the 65th consecutive fiscal year.

“Those issues are floating around, and I think it’s a concern: trying to keep them out” of the NDAA and other defense bills, said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, in a brief interview.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, lost both legs and partial use of her right arm when a rocket-propelled grenade struck the Army helicopter she was co-piloting in Iraq in 2004. Duckworth is now a leading Senate advocate for transgender people in the services and in military families.

“When the helicopter I was co-piloting was shot down and I was bleeding to death on a dusty field in Iraq, I didn’t care if the American troops rescuing me were trans, gay, straight or anything else,” Duckworth said by email on Thursday. “If you’re willing to sacrifice for our country and can kill the enemy with lethal precision, you shouldn’t be denied the opportunity to serve.”

Partisan flashpoint

A year ago, House Democrats supported the fiscal 2025 NDAA during the Armed Services markup. Yet the normally bipartisan bill passed only narrowly on the House floor in a largely party-line vote. That is because most Democrats, including Smith, opposed it over “culture war” amendments that had been added during floor debate.

These included an amendment that would bar TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, from covering gender-transition surgeries and hormone treatments.

That amendment never made it into the final fiscal 2025 NDAA, though the bill did contain a ban on TRICARE coverage of gender dysphoria treatments for minor beneficiaries that “could result in sterilization.”

Now conservatives have renewed their push.

The House intends to debate its fiscal 2026 NDAA in September, and the Senate may take up its own NDAA around the same time.

While the version of the fiscal 2026 NDAA that emerged from the House Armed Services Committee does not have provisions that pertain to transgender service members, their supporters fully expect to see amendments on the issue during floor debate.

Meanwhile, the Senate NDAA and two House-passed funding bills for the Pentagon in fiscal 2026 already contain conservative provisions restricting health care for transgender service members or adult dependents.

Specifically, the Senate’s new NDAA would prohibit the use of Defense Department funds or facilities to support “sex change surgeries.”

The House-passed Defense spending bill for the coming fiscal year would severely restrict the ability of military families with children affected by gender dysphoria to obtain hormone therapy, and it would limit their chances of arranging their duty stations around their family’s health care needs. A similar provision was in the House-passed fiscal 2025 NDAA, but it was stripped out of the final version.

And the House-passed fiscal 2026 Military Construction-VA bill, which affects care for millions of veterans, would bar use of funds in the bill to obtain “surgical procedures or hormone therapies for the purposes of gender-affirming care.”

Smith said Congress is going too far.

“If you want to have a reasonable conversation about what the right medical treatment is, that’s fine,” Smith said. “But doing outright bans on treatments that at least in some instances have proven successful is not something I think Congress should be doing.”

Executive actions

It is unclear how many transgender people have been serving in the U.S. military.

The figure was about 14,000 in 2018, according to the Palm Center, a now-defunct organization that used to track the issue.

According to the Defense Department statistics cited by Pentagon officials in May, about 5,000 service members were either diagnosed with gender dysphoria or voluntarily identified themselves as such.

The figure is probably an understatement, transgender servicemembers’ advocates said. And it does not include Defense Department civilians, veterans, retirees who use TRICARE for Life insurance — nor any adult dependents of those who are signed up for any TRICARE plan.

No law, up to now, has prohibited TRICARE from covering gender-transition surgeries, though service members who have sought coverage for such procedures have had to go through a painstaking bureaucratic process to make it happen, their advocates say.

But now the Trump administration, through a January executive order and subsequent Pentagon policy guidance, has barred people with gender dysphoria from serving in the military. The Trump administration has halted TRICARE coverage of all gender-transition surgeries. And it has made it so hormonal treatments can now only be obtained via civilian care outside of the military health system.

Yet Trump’s actions are not laws and so are not binding on subsequent administrations. The Biden administration overturned Trump’s first-term restrictions on transgender military service, and Trump promptly undid Biden’s orders.

‘Conservative win’

At issue on Capitol Hill later this year will be proposed laws, not executive actions.

The Senate Armed Services Committee approved earlier this month — in a 14-13 party line vote — an amendment to the fiscal 2026 NDAA by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., that prohibits the use of Defense Department funds or facilities “to perform or facilitate sex change surgeries.”

Tuberville, who announced in May he will run for governor of Alabama in 2026 rather than seek reelection to the Senate, cited the provision as a “conservative win” in a statement.

Another win, he said, was a separate provision in the Senate NDAA that would aim to ensure the military service academies cannot permit “a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.”

To many conservatives, taxpayer funds should not be used to support something they consider to be unnatural and, some say, a detriment to military readiness.

“A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,” said President Donald Trump in his executive order mandating the ban.

Still, little evidence has been produced to suggest military readiness has suffered from the presence of transgender service members.

‘Two standards’

Advocates for transgender Defense Department employees and affected military families worry that the Senate NDAA proposal would prohibit by law medically necessary health care surgeries for not just active-duty service members but potentially also reservists, civilians, some veterans and retirees — as well as any of their adult dependents.

The United States would have in effect two medical systems for gender-transition surgery, advocates say: one permitting a variety of treatments for gender dysphoria that are embraced by leading medical professionals; and a second for Defense Department employees and people who live in states with similar restrictions.

Some states allow Medicaid coverage of transgender care, while others do not. And Medicare does cover “medically necessary” gender-affirming care but only if certain conditions are met.

“It would set two different standards of care,” said Cathy Marcello, the interim executive director of the Modern Military Association of America, referring to the changes in Pentagon treatment of transgender health care services.

“It matters that the NDAA would codify an anti-LGBTQ health care policy for adults in federal law,” said Marcello, whose group advocates on behalf of LGBTQ+ members of the military and veterans community and their families. “That’s a precedent we would not want the NDAA to set. That would be very hard to undo. It would set a pattern for other administrations.”

Marine Corps sized population

Marcello and other advocates for transgender individuals contend that Pentagon policies restricting health care for such people deny qualified personnel the opportunity to serve their country in the military — and deny the country their skills and commitment.

The Palm Center estimated in 2020 that there are more than 205,000 transgender Americans of recruiting age — more than the number of active-duty Marines.

Duckworth and 22 other Senate Democrats wrote Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in June on Trump administration efforts to bar transgender service members and restrict federal support for their health care.

“Banning them from service will compromise good order and discipline, take deployable servicemembers out of the fight and create national security risks felt for years to come,” the senators wrote.

‘Exceptional’ dependents

As for the House–passed fiscal 2026 Defense appropriations bill, it would bar funding “to provide gender transition procedures, including surgery or medication, referrals for those procedures, or a change in duty station for these activities for a child through the Exceptional Family Member Program.”

This provision would prohibit TRICARE doctors from prescribing hormone treatments or making referrals for that, advocates said.

The Exceptional Family Member Program provides a way for servicemembers with dependents who have special needs to ensure that fact is considered when assigning the location of duty stations.

That option would no longer be available under this provision, for instance, for military families with adolescents who seek hormone treatments — making their military service conflict with their family’s medical needs, transgender troops’ advocates say.

“Every day, highly qualified, well trained DOD employees clock in and go to work serving their country, and they deserve dignity, respect, and our gratitude for their tireless work,” said David Stacy, vice president of government affairs for Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights. “Instead, this administration and their enablers in Congress are trying to rip away access to surgical care that transgender employees’ doctors have said they need. Those employees deserve better.”

Keep in mind: TRICARE doesn’t own these platforms. Other agencies or contractors do. But you can visit the TRICARE All Logins page for a comprehensive list.

Here’s what to know.

One healthcare system, several portals

There’s no single portal that does it all. Instead, different login platforms support different parts of your benefit. Generally, they fall into three categories:

Updating personal information and enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System

Getting care at military hospitals and clinics with MHS GENESIS

Getting civilian care through a TRICARE contractor

Here’s a look at each.

DEERS and milConnect/Beneficiary Web Enrollment

DEERS is the foundation of TRICARE eligibility. The milConnect website lets you update contact information, check your enrollment status, and access Beneficiary Web Enrollment tools. You can use this platform to:

Enroll in or change TRICARE plans

Update contact information, like your address or phone number

milConnect now uses myAuth, a new user-friendly secure login that is gradually replacing DS Logon. Keep reading to learn more about myAuth.

MHS GENESIS Patient Portal

If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal is your main access point. You can:

View laboratory results

Request prescription refills

Make appointments

Send secure messages

You may also view your health records and appointment notes from military hospitals and clinics.

Regional contractor portals

Health care outside of military hospitals and clinics is administered by TRICARE contractors. Each has its own portal:

TRICARE East Region: Humana Military

TRICARE West Region: TriWest Healthcare Alliance

TRICARE Overseas: International SOS

TRICARE For Life (in all regions): WPS Military and Veterans Health

Use these portals to:

View claims

Check referrals

Find network providers

Pharmacy login

Express Scripts is the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor. Through their portal, you can switch eligible medications to TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and:

Request new prescriptions

Refill prescriptions

Track your order status

Pay bills

Dental login

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? If so, United Concordia is your TRICARE dental contractor. Your United Concordia TDP My Account lets you:

View plan coverage details

Check claims history

View your dental explanation of benefits

Pay bills

What is myAuth?

myAuth is a new secure login option replacing DS Logon across Department of Defense systems. With myAuth, you can use your Common Access Card or a username/password, plus a secure multi-factor authentication method. This lets you access multiple DOD websites with just one login.

Currently, myAuth is used on:

milConnect

ID Card Office Online

Over time, all DOD systems that use DS Logon will transition to myAuth. Until then, platforms may use either DS Logon or myAuth depending on their system. (Note: You must have an active DS Logon account to create a new myAuth account.)

Civilian health portals

If you see a civilian provider, your provider may use an electronic health record, or EHR, other than MHS GENESIS. The DOD doesn’t own these other EHRs. You’ll need to follow your provider’s instructions to sign in and view records or communicate with providers.

Bottom line

Managing your TRICARE benefit means knowing which login to use—and when. While it may seem complex, here’s a breakdown:

Use milConnect for enrollment and DEERS updates.

Use MHS GENESIS to see your records for care at military hospitals and clinics.

Use your TRICARE contractor’s portal to manage claims, view referrals, and pay bills.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.

Remember: myAuth is coming, bringing with it a more unified login experience. Until then, save the portals you use most, keep your passwords safe, and check back for updates as the rollout continues.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/24/2003760729/1920/1080/0/250724-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-07-24 15:56:07.085602

For decades, the number of Medicare-funded residency slots has remained effectively frozen, creating a bottleneck that’s worsened the country’s physician shortage and left aspiring doctors with fewer pathways to practice.

Recently, Congress revived H.R. 3890, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, a bipartisan bill that would add 14,000 new Medicare-supported residency slots over the next seven years—marking the most significant expansion of the physician training pipeline in nearly 30 years.

The bill would increase the number of available slots by 2,000 each year from 2026 through 2032, with at least 10% of those new positions directed toward hospitals in rural areas, medically underserved communities and regions with new medical schools. It also limits each hospital to a maximum of 75 additional slots over the seven-year period.

The California Medical Association (CMA) has long pushed for this kind of investment. With the U.S. facing a projected shortfall of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036, expanding graduate medical education (GME) is no longer optional if we hope to close that gap and ensure that patient access to care does not continue to erode.

The bill also makes permanent the Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) Program, which supports the creation of new rural training tracks to encourage physicians to practice in hard-to-reach regions.

If passed, the legislation would mark a rare and long-overdue federal investment in physician workforce development. Medicare has supported residency training since the program’s inception in 1965, but a cap imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has constrained the growth of GME ever since. Only small increments—1,000 slots in 2021 and another 200 in 2023—have been added since.

This bipartisan proposal is backed by more than 200 members of Congress.

At the same time, CMA’s philanthropic arm—Physicians for a Healthy California—is gearing up for a major expansion of its GME grant programs, funded by last year’s Prop. 35. Look for more information on the upcoming grant cycles very soon.

This hastens the referral process, allowing patients to see specialty providers in the network as soon as necessary.

For members and families with TRICARE Prime, if your Primary Care Manager (PCM) determines you need medical treatment they can’t provide, they can put in a referral for specialty care.

“Any time that your PCM determines that you need specialty care that we can't offer in the primary care clinics, you will receive a referral,” explained the TOPA flight chief.

Certain specialty care providers require that the patient’s medical notes are reviewed before seeing the patient, and in some cases before they book the appointment.

Under the previous referral process, patients were directed to visit TOPA after their initial appointment with their PCM, where they would “activate” their referral, fill out a request for notes to be sent to the specialist, and receive the TRICARE Prime travel benefit brief. This is no longer required.

“The goal of the new referral process is to improve access to specialty care with a more seamless process,” said the TOPA flight chief.

With the new referral process, patients wait two to three business days after their PCM appointment to review their referral on the TriWest Patient Portal. Using the information on the TriWest Patient Portal, patients call the specialist and schedule an appointment.

If the specialist notifies the patient that they require clinical notes to be seen, then the patient should call or visit TOPA to have the necessary notes faxed. On average, it takes eight to ten business days for the specialty care clinic to receive the notes.

Once the patient has an appointment with a specialist, provide the date and time to Referral Management - TOPA, or the patient will receive automated phone calls as a reminder to book their specialty care appointment.

Any specialty referrals submitted between January 1, 2025 and June 8, 2025 - with the exception of inpatient care, applied behavior analysis/autism care demonstration services, laboratory developed tests, extended care health option services and other services that require pre-authorization – will still fall under the TRICARE West Region Referral Waiver and follow a different process. These referrals are valid until September 30, 2025 and can be viewed on the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal.

That was in 2019. | Health.mil,"Robert Hammer, MHS Communications",,,,,https://health.mil/News/Dvids-Articles/2025/07/23/news543657,"Military Health System Partnership, Specialized Care Saves Special Operations Soldier U.S. Army Master Sgt.
It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.
“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said.
Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.” Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition.
That’s reality.” Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.","Military Health System Partnership, Specialized Care Saves Special Operations Soldier

U.S. Army Master Sgt. Jerry Millan lives life by two promises:

“I’m not done yet,” was his vow when Military Health System doctors gave him a lifechanging diagnosis—a rare cancer in his abdominal area, the “most aggressive cancer they've ever come across,” he said. It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.

The second, “I got you,” is his assurance to fellow service members he mentors that he’ll be there to support them and his fellow athletes as they prepare for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games.

Millan’s cancer has been in remission for over five years, and he shares his story of survival to encourage and lift up others facing difficult odds.

A Sudden Pain, A Grim Diagnosis

Millan, a special operations forces soldier, was participating in pre-deployment training in the woods of Fort Polk, Louisiana, when he hit the ground and felt a sharp pain in his gut. He thought it was just a hernia. A medic agreed and ordered a scan. The scan confirmed an umbilical hernia, but the military radiologist saw more.

“I just had this pain in my navel. It wasn’t a typical pain from exercise or indigestion; rather, something unfamiliar” Millan recalled. “But thanks to the radiologist—they saw multiple masses inside my abdomen.”

He was immediately sent to the Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where specialists identified Burkitt’s Lymphoma, an aggressive growing type of cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. He waited with his parents to find out the prognosis.

“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said. “I'm just sitting there looking at like the floor, my dad's sitting at the edge of the bed, and I started saying to myself, ‘I'm not done yet.’”

“It was just a decision to live.”

MHS and NIH Partner to Save his Life

Because Burkitt’s Lymphoma is rare, Walter Reed oncologists quickly linked Millan with doctors and researchers at the NIH who study the disease. The partnership gave him access to an experimental, high-dose chemotherapy protocol for six cycles.

“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said. “At the time, three doctors in network in the United States were trained on that type of cancer.”

Like the cancer, the treatment was aggressive.

“You’re given a massive dose of chemotherapy—I was on a 96-hour drip at first,” he said. “It was the harshest form of chemotherapy that has been developed. But you had to do it because the cancer, by that time, grew over 1000%. My gut was extremely distended.”

Besides the side effects of cancer treatments, he found the isolation to be an additional challenge. He was diagnosed just before the pandemic in 2020. Due to his severely compromised immune system and COVID-19, he was unable to be around people for the better part of a year. On top of that, the unit he trained so hard with deployed without him.

“My friends were deployed; I couldn't see my family. I couldn't have conversations face to face, it was: Wash your hands, wear your face shields, don’t touch each other,” he said.

His mental resilience was one of the key factors to his recovery. Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.”

Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition. They gave his mother a place to stay during treatment, arranged flights, and later linked him to educational resources and a staff position to let him continue serving while he healed.

They made sure his mother could focus on him and not on logistics. “She didn’t have to worry about anything,” Millan said. “She could just focus on me.”

After his chemotherapy rounds, doctors declared him cancer-free.

Finding New Strength Through Sports

Millan looked for what was next and returned to serving—yet struggled to navigate what his new duty looked like while in recovery.

“I felt like they really had no use for me. They had people that were deployable and ready to go. And I can’t. That’s reality.”

Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.

“The Military Adaptive Sports program provided me the opportunity to find a new purpose in life by helping others going through similar situations,” he said. “They helped me find a new community.”

He trained for powerlifting, rowing, sitting volleyball, track and field, and precision air sports. At his first DOD Warrior Games in 2022, he balanced competition with duty, commuting between his events in Orlando and his assignment at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. The camaraderie hooked him.

“Once I got to participate and train with the other athletes that were there, I learned about their stories and the things they’re going through,” he said. “It's like, wow, you know, there are other people out there in the military community … that all have their struggles, and they are facing their adversity.”

“Then I ended up finding this new community,” Millan added, “I didn’t realize how badly I needed that.”

He was invited to participate in the 2025 Invictus Games, where he took Gold in rowing. The togetherness, teamwork, and community inspired his second promise.

‘I Got You’

In the 2025 games, Millan will again wear Team SOCOM colors. He qualified for the “Ultimate Champion” category, a grueling slate of every individual event: powerlifting, cycling, swimming, archery, shooting, rowing, track and field, and volleyball. He uses his experience to help service members who are struggling, recruiting new athletes, visiting recovery units, and offering virtual coaching to anyone who needs it. He shares his message of recovery and support to uplift others.

“If you’re a teammate of mine, I got you,” he stresses. “I will come to you and walk you through the things that helped me. I’ll do this with you. I’ll tell them this is what I did that helped me. I didn't follow a guided path. I didn't have someone walking me through it. But if you're in my community … I got you.”

Health and Fitness Key to Recovery

As the WCP-CC East Region noncommissioned officer in charge, he is a liaison to U.S. Army Special Operations Command and visits the Soldier Recovery Unit twice a week. He demonstrates workouts, shares nutrition tips, and, most importantly, listens.

“I learn about their stories and the stuff they're going through,” Millan said. “I say, ‘here are the things that helped me to get through what I was going through.’ Maybe what I've learned in my own journey that could possibly help.”

“I just embrace it, and they embrace. That helps amplify any type of recovery,” he added.

To continue to keep his own health in check, he trains. He believes movement builds mood and resilience. A chemotherapy-induced heart issue demands top fitness, so he lifts, rows, and runs often.

“To build resilience, you have to build a routine,” he said. “Maybe you start with walking 20 minutes a day. Then it builds from there. Your body is meant to move.” For him, exercise helps his mental health. “My mood and my attitude are directly tied to how I feel.”

Millan maintains annual needed checkups through the care of his MHS team.

“I get labs and then I have specialty care for my heart,” he said. “I'm able to use these specialty clinics to help with issues I'm having from chemotherapy right on base.”

Millan refuses to let cancer define him, but it does define his new outlook—living by a new mantra:

“There’s more I want to do in life,” he said. “And I’m not done yet.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Jerry-Millan.png,N,0.0,2025-07-24 13:56:14.578085

Generally speaking, you have to wait until the annual open season to be able to switch your health care coverage.
What Counts as a QLE However, you can also make changes to your Tricare plan within 90 days of someone in your family having a qualifying life event.
With Select, you don't need a referral and you can go to any Tricare-authorized provider, not just those who accept Tricare Prime.","Qualifying life events (QLEs) are situations that allow you to change your Tricare health plan without waiting for the annual open season. QLEs can be a powerful tool to get the right plan without delay. Therefore, it's worth knowing what counts as a QLE and how the process works.

Tricare, like most health care programs, won’t let you switch between plans whenever you feel like it. Generally speaking, you have to wait until the annual open season to be able to switch your health care coverage. Tricare's open season typically runs from the Monday of the second full week in November to the Monday of the second full week in December. Changes made during this open season take effect Jan. 1.

What Counts as a QLE

However, you can also make changes to your Tricare plan within 90 days of someone in your family having a qualifying life event. Tricare has a pretty long list of QLEs. These include:

Retiring

Separating from the military

Activating or deactivating from reserve or National Guard

Marriage, divorce or annulment

Birth or adoption of a child

Placement of a child by a court in a member's home

Children becoming adults

Death in the family

Child moving away to college

Relocation to a new country, city, region or ZIP code

Government-directed primary care manager change

Government-directed health plan change

Gaining or losing permission to have family members accompany the military member at an overseas assignment

A retired reservist turning age 60 and gaining Tricare eligibility

Becoming eligible for Medicare

Change in eligibility status for either member of a joint service family

Losing or gaining other health insurance, such as employer insurance

Rapid Response to Changing Circumstances

As you can see, many people experience one or more of these situations each year, opening opportunities to change Tricare plans.

For example, let's say you're on Tricare Prime. Prime requires all care to be coordinated through the patient's primary care manager. You need a referral for any specialty care, and speciality care must be from a Prime network provider.

Your child injures their knee playing soccer, and you're frustrated with the process to get the necessary radiological imaging and referrals to physical therapy. But, your other child just moved to college. As long as you're within 90 days of that change of address, you're in a QLE period that would allow you to switch to Tricare Select. With Select, you don't need a referral and you can go to any Tricare-authorized provider, not just those who accept Tricare Prime.

Switching Tricare Coverage After a QLE

In order for the QLE to unlock your ability to change Tricare plans, you'll first need to make any relevant changes to your personal information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), such as updating an address. Then contact Tricare within 90 days of the QLE to make your plan change. You should be able to do this online or by telephone.

The plan change will be retroactive to the date of the QLE, so it'll make your life easier if you make the change as close to the QLE as possible. Otherwise, you may need to refile claims for care that took place during that period of time. That can get messy, so it's best to avoid it.

If your change incurs the payment of any enrollment fees or premiums, you'll need to pay those retroactively to the date of the QLE. For example, if you're part of a retiree family whose sponsor entered the military before Jan. 1, 2018, and you switch from Tricare Select to Tricare Prime, you'll owe those additional enrollment fees from the date of the QLE to the date that you made the switch.

It's important to note that Uniformed Services Family Health Plans (USFHP) are a Tricare Prime primary care manager (PCM) choice and that movement between USFHP and military-managed Tricare Prime does not have to wait for an open season or QLE. You can switch between military-managed Tricare Prime and a USFHP at any point in time.

“And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.” In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games.

I probably wouldn’t be where I am at today if it wasn’t for the military healthcare system and Air Force Wounded Warrior Program.”","After U.S. Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Aaron Lin cleared landmines from an Iraqi neighborhood in 2008, a local resident came up and reached out his hand. “Thank you for making my neighborhood safe for my grandkids,” the man told the explosive ordnance disposal technician.

It was a moment of gratitude and trust that Lin carried with him throughout his deployment. “I thought to myself, I could do this job for the rest of my life,” he said. “We were disarming 10 improvised explosive devices a day …trip wires, land mines, pressure plates, anything you could think of. I was supremely confident.”

But an attack on his unit during another deployment in Afghanistan took a toll on him. “All that confidence I had just went to the basement. It just bottomed out.”

He would begin to suffer an injury with no visible scars: posttraumatic stress disorder. It was Lin’s turn to reach out—and his leadership, family, and professionals in the Military Health System took his hand.

Attack on March 30, 2010

Lin and his team were disarming IEDs on foot when an explosion ripped through their patrol. Two of his friends were killed. He felt immense guilt that he survived when others died. “I got blown up a couple times, but that part didn’t really bother me,” he said. “What bothered me is we had a couple casualties that day. I should have died out there with them.”

Lin said the motto of EOD training, “initial success or total failure,” haunted him as he felt like “a complete failure.” He returned home, but not the same. Even in joyous moments, he felt nothing. “I was numb,” Lin said. “I could not feel closeness to my wife. I just couldn’t feel anything.” He deployed again but was “running away from my problems and everything.” When he returned home this time, he experienced depression and detachment, and suffered nightmares. It was a “a pain that I can't describe,” he said. “But I could feel it in my heart.”

A Sergeant Intervenes

Lin, then stationed at Joint Base Andrews, was struggling as new deployment orders to Syria fast approached. “I could not handle it. I was not sleeping and having nightmares every other night.”

A unit leader noticed Lin was struggling. According to Lin, he was doing the “first sergeant thing” by simply asking if he was OK. “I was like, ‘I'm fine, I’m fine. I don’t need any help,’” said Lin. But the first sergeant could tell he wasn’t fine. At his encouragement, Lin decided to go to the mental health clinic.

That intervention led to six weeks of intensive outpatient treatment at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. There, he was diagnosed with PTSD and started a comprehensive treatment plan under the care of his MHS team. “They had a schedule for me printed out for the whole six weeks,” he said. “Cognitive processing therapy, yoga, art, sleep classes, group therapy … it helped me to start looking at things differently. It’s basically anything you can think of to help yourself work through it.”

He credits the Fort Belvoir care team with saving his life. “That intensive outpatient truly changed me … I came out of it so much better than I was before.”

Lin was also inspired by the acts of the first sergeant that he applied to be one himself. “When he pushed me to go to mental health, I decided that I wanted to become a first sergeant so I could pay it forward and help other people,” he said. Like his former first sergeant, he encouraged those who seemed to be struggling to seek help. Yet an attempted suicide in Lin’s unit brought back to negative thoughts of doubt and self-worth. “All those feelings that I got back while I was deployed: ‘What could I have done different?’ I thought I did everything that I possibly could to prevent that. I began to plummet again.”

‘Warrior Mindset’ and Perseverance

While Lin continued mental health treatment, a friend and fellow EOD technician convinced him to give the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program a chance. Lin questioned whether he deserved to be in the program. “I’m not missing a limb,” he said. “I don’t think I belong.” But seeing the other wounded warriors sharing their own stories, Lin decided to try out for Team Air Force. “I found something that helped me reconnect,” Lin said. “Being with other warriors who understood, it gave me a path forward.”

“I found the power of sports, competing, striving for something,” Lin said. “And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.”

In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games. He went on to earn silver medals in wheelchair basketball and rugby.

His new passion for athletics didn’t stop there. At trials and competitions throughout the year, Lin medaled in air pistol, placed in archery, and exceled in discus, shot put, and rowing. In the 2024 DOD Warrior Games, he recalled a moment where he channeled his “warrior mindset” when his rowing team was facing last place in competition. “When I was in Afghanistan and Iraq, you had to have that warrior mindset,” Lin said. “If your team is down, you still have to push through, whether that’s on the field of sports or the field of battle.”

He leveraged the experience of his own journey to encourage his team to persevere. “We are not representing the Air Force like this,” he told the team. “We pulled each other up and ended up coming back and getting bronze. That bronze felt like gold.”

Out of competition, Lin gave back. He has mentored adaptive sports athletes and has helped several make Team Air Force. He shared his journey as an Air Force Wounded Warrior ambassador, speaking at events to fellow service members around the country. He encourages fellow service members to reach out to local mental-health clinics, chaplains, or inpatient care, and shares resources like to Military OneSource for support.

Even with all the support from his health care team, the Wounded Warrior program, and friends, Lin stresses his wife has been his strongest form of support, “100%.” “She’s my caregiver. She reminds me to take my medicine, grounds me when I wake up from night terrors. She’s the reason I can do what I do,” he said. “What’s most important is you and your family. That’s forever.”

He said the warrior mindset is not about perfection, “It’s about heart and perseverance.”

Lighting the Path Forward

Since 2024, Lin has been promoted to senior master sergeant, received his master’s degree, named Air Force Male Athlete of the Year, and is competing in the 2025 DOD Warrior Games, representing his team as a torchbearer—an honor bestowed upon him by his teammates. “They entrusted me to be the warrior spirit of the team,” he said. “I don’t take that lightly.”

Lin hopes his story encourages others to ask for help and stay the course. “When you or your team gets knocked down, you got to get back up. Got to do it again. Got to try again.”

Lin said he continues to push forward. Still serving. Still finishing the mission—thanks to the care of his MHS team. “I wish I had sought help earlier, but I’m here now, and I’m better for it,” Lin said. “Our health care system really didn't turn me away.

The Medicare exclusion Best known as the federal health insurance program for adults aged 65 and older, Medicare also covers nearly 7 million non-elderly people with disabilities.
Depending on the type of birth control, these costs may add up to anywhere between $48 and $1,800 a year.
For women with disabilities, a population with higher unemployment rates and lower wages than the general population, that kind of cost is a major deterrent to getting on birth control.
Advocates are contacting their congressional representatives to push for action, but the current Congress seems more focused on stripping people of their health insurance than improving it.","With new laws in 19 U.S. states giving residents little choice but to carry an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy to term, many people consider access to birth control more essential than ever.

In the six months after the Supreme Court revoked the constitutional right to abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, permanent contraception use surged. Rates of tubal sterilization increased most among U.S. women aged 18 to 49 who lived in states with abortion bans. In those states, from June to December of 2022, procedure rates rose 39 percent, from 3.6 procedures per 10,000 women per month to 5 procedures per 10,000 women per month (a “person-month” is a way researchers can measure change over time in a given population).

This increased reliance on permanent contraception has been made possible by federal mandates requiring that health insurers cover contraceptives without out-of-pocket costs. By law, the federal low-income plan Medicaid, the U.S. military insurer TRICARE, and most employer-based private health insurance plans protect the vast majority of insured women—perhaps as many as 90 percent, according to our calculations—from receiving bills as high as $6,000 for tubal ligation surgery.

Yet, even as more women seek permanent or long-acting reversible contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy, our research shows that people with disabilities may struggle to obtain a permanent or long-lasting solution. This is particularly true for those enrolled in Medicare, which remains exempt from the federal mandates that make birth control an economic possibility for so many women.

The Medicare exclusion

Best known as the federal health insurance program for adults aged 65 and older, Medicare also covers nearly 7 million non-elderly people with disabilities. This figure includes more than 1.3 million reproductive-aged women, research shows.

Yet Medicare does not cover permanent contraception for pregnancy prevention—only as a treatment for conditions like endometriosis. Patients can be denied that coverage even when clinicians explicitly indicate that a future pregnancy could seriously endanger their health. Medicare also requires that patients pay substantial out-of-pocket costs for hormonal birth control pills and long-acting reversible contraceptives like intrauterine devices (IUDs), typically requiring copays (a fixed dollar amount) or coinsurance (a percentage of the full cost). Depending on the type of birth control, these costs may add up to anywhere between $48 and $1,800 a year.

For women with disabilities, a population with higher unemployment rates and lower wages than the general population, that kind of cost is a major deterrent to getting on birth control.

A new peer-reviewed study, published in JAMA Network Open in June 2025 and conducted by Meghan Bellerose, one of the authors of this story, finds that women with disabilities enrolled in Medicare had 72 percent lower contraceptive use than women with disabilities enrolled in Medicaid, the federal government’s other public health insurance plan, which fully covers contraception.

Some of these Medicare-insured women later obtained full contraceptive coverage by enrolling in an additional insurance plan—specifically, Medicaid. Contraceptive use among those women increased by 35 percent within one year, the study shows.

Medicare’s contraception problem was on the Biden administration’s radar. That led to some progress in Medicare covering contraceptives, including IUDs and implants (albeit with copays and coinsurance). It’s unclear why those changes did not include full contraceptive coverage on par with Medicaid and TRICARE.

Given that the vast majority of Medicare’s reproductive-aged population is disabled, this coverage gap has undeniably discriminatory effects. And it reinforces longstanding neglect of disabled women’s reproductive health needs in the United States.

Historic discrimination continues

The origins of Medicare’s contraception exclusions are rooted in a troubling history of reproductive discrimination against disabled women.

Nearly a century ago, a notorious 1927 Supreme Court case called Buck v. Bell legally sanctioned the forced sterilization of people deemed “feebleminded,” a category that explicitly included people with disabilities. The case originated with 17-year-old Carrie Buck, whose state mental institution sought to forcibly sterilize her after she was raped and became pregnant. Disturbingly, according to the National Women’s Law Center, 31 states and Washington, D.C. still have forced sterilization laws on their books. Their existence underscores the deeply entrenched ableism within American reproductive policy.

Today, harmful stereotypes persist about sex and people with disabilities. Disabled women frequently report that health-care providers expressed surprise or discomfort when they requested contraception. Research shows that this reaction reflects outdated assumptions that people with disabilities are asexual or do not want to become parents. In reality, disabled women are just as likely to desire sexual relationships and pregnancy as anyone else, and they need the same access to contraception.

In this way, our research shows that Medicare’s lack of contraceptive coverage intensifies existing and historic inequality in the U.S. It simultaneously endangers women’s health, autonomy, and dignity.

Little progress in states or Congress

There’s a clear path out of this mess, but it would require Congress to act.

In December 2024, Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced a bipartisan bill, Closing the Contraception Coverage Gap Act, which would eliminate cost-sharing for contraception in the Medicare program. Evidence shows that similar changes to private insurance plans made under the Affordable Care Act increased contraceptive use.

But the bill died with the end of the last legislative session. To advance, the legislation must be reintroduced then scheduled for a hearing before a full-Senate vote by the Senate Finance Committee —a stage that roughly ten percent of introduced bills reach. Advocates are contacting their congressional representatives to push for action, but the current Congress seems more focused on stripping people of their health insurance than improving it.

In the shorter term, the Department of Health and Human Services could update the list of prescriptions covered by Medicare to eliminate copays and coinsurance for hormonal birth control pills and other prescription contraceptive methods, with changes going into effect within 60 days without a state approval process. Meanwhile, states could extend their own contraceptive care safety nets, for example by expanding Title X clinics, although that, too, is difficult given recent Republican cuts to Medicaid and Planned Parenthood.

These reforms expanding contraceptive access to 1.5 million more Americans were important before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. They are urgent now.",https://rewirenewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Medicare-Contraception-Web.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-24 12:56:11.915247

For patients currently covered by these insurance plans, the transition to in-network status means reduced out-of-pocket costs and simplified billing processes. Prospective patients are encouraged to verify their specific coverage details and benefits.

Using TRICARE for Inpatient Rehab Care in Orange County TRICARE does cover inpatient rehab in Orange County, CA, for those who meet eligibility and medical necessity criteria, specifically at approved facilities like South Shores Recovery.","If you or someone you care about is exploring inpatient rehab options in Orange County, California, and you have TRICARE insurance, one of the first concerns is whether your plan will help cover the cost. Understanding your benefits can be challenging, especially during a time when finding help feels urgent. The short answer is yes — TRICARE does provide coverage for inpatient rehab, but it’s important to understand how it works, what’s included, and the steps to access treatment.

In this insightful resource, Downbeach reviews TRICARE’s inpatient rehab benefits, the requirements you’ll need to meet, and what you can expect when seeking treatment in Orange County.

Understanding TRICARE and Eligibility

TRICARE is the health care program for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, and eligible family members. It also covers certain survivors and former spouses. The program offers comprehensive medical benefits, including behavioral health and substance use disorder treatment.

For those in California, TRICARE operates through regional contractors who manage provider networks and authorize care. If you live in Orange County or are stationed nearby, you may be able to use TRICARE benefits at approved rehab facilities in the area.

Eligibility is determined by your status and plan type—TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Reserve Select, and others each have different referral and authorization processes.

Does TRICARE Cover Inpatient Rehab?

TRICARE covers inpatient rehab for substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions when treatment is deemed medically necessary. Inpatient rehab, also called residential treatment, means staying at a facility for round-the-clock care and structured therapeutic programming.

Services covered under inpatient rehab may include:

Medically supervised detoxification

Individual, group, and family therapy sessions

Medication-assisted treatment when appropriate

24-hour clinical monitoring and support

Aftercare and discharge planning

Length of stay depends on clinical assessments and ongoing reviews. Pre-authorization is typically required, except in emergencies where stabilization must occur before formal approvals.

TRICARE’s Requirements for Coverage

To use TRICARE benefits for inpatient rehab, several conditions must be met:

Medical Necessity

A licensed provider must confirm that inpatient care is clinically necessary. This is often determined when outpatient care is not enough to ensure safety or effective recovery, such as in cases of severe withdrawal risk, repeated relapses, or co-occurring mental health conditions.

Authorized Facilities

Only TRICARE-approved facilities qualify for coverage in the area, including an accredited treatment facility in Orange County. Some local rehabs may be out-of-network, which can affect costs and require additional approvals. It’s important to verify network status before admission.

Referral and Pre-Authorization

Depending on your plan, you may need both a referral from your primary care manager (PCM) and pre-authorization from TRICARE. Emergency situations may allow admission without prior authorization, but follow-up approval will still be needed.

Inpatient Rehab in Orange County

Orange County is known for its high-quality treatment programs and access to specialized services for military families. Some centers in the region focus on evidence-based care and offer dual diagnosis treatment for those dealing with both substance use and mental health challenges, including a trusted treatment center that takes TRICARE.

Inpatient rehab typically begins with a comprehensive intake and medical assessment, followed by detox if necessary. After stabilization, clients engage in daily therapy, structured activities, and holistic support designed to promote recovery.

Program lengths vary, but many run 30, 60, or 90 days depending on clinical progress and TRICARE authorizations.

Costs and Out-of-Pocket Expenses

While TRICARE covers most inpatient rehab costs, your exact out-of-pocket expenses depend on several factors:

Plan type: TRICARE Prime usually has lower costs compared to TRICARE Select.

Network status: In-network facilities typically reduce your share of the cost, while out-of-network care may involve higher cost-sharing or balance billing.

Status (active duty vs. retiree): Active duty members generally have minimal or no cost-sharing obligations.

Confirming benefits ahead of time—through both TRICARE and the facility—helps prevent unexpected costs.

Coordinating Care Through TRICARE

To make the process smoother, take these steps when seeking inpatient rehab:

Verify that the facility is TRICARE-authorized.

Obtain any required referral or pre-authorization.

Confirm your cost-sharing responsibilities and covered services.

Coordinate aftercare plans for continued support following discharge.

Admissions staff at many Orange County rehabs are familiar with TRICARE’s processes and can assist with documentation and approvals.

Coverage for Co-Occurring Mental Health Conditions

Many people with substance use disorders also experience mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, or anxiety. TRICARE covers integrated treatment for these co-occurring conditions, often referred to as dual diagnosis care.

Receiving treatment for both substance use and mental health issues at the same time is considered best practice, and TRICARE often authorizes this approach when medically necessary.

Alternatives to Inpatient Care

If you do not require 24-hour supervision, TRICARE also covers other levels of behavioral health care, including:

Partial hospitalization programs (PHP): Intensive day programs with structured therapy but no overnight stay.

Intensive outpatient programs (IOP): Multiple therapy sessions each week, often used as step-down care after inpatient treatment.

Standard outpatient therapy: Weekly or biweekly sessions for ongoing recovery support.

These options can be effective for individuals with stable living environments and lower clinical risk.

How to Get Started

If you’re ready to begin the process:

Contact your PCM or military treatment facility to discuss your situation and request a referral.

Call TRICARE or your regional contractor to verify coverage, confirm network facilities, and check authorization requirements.

Speak with Orange County rehab centers that accept TRICARE to learn about program availability and admissions steps.

Taking these actions can help ensure a smoother path to treatment and recovery.

Using TRICARE for Inpatient Rehab Care in Orange County

TRICARE does cover inpatient rehab in Orange County, CA, for those who meet eligibility and medical necessity criteria, specifically at approved facilities like South Shores Recovery.

By understanding your plan’s requirements, confirming facility authorization, and coordinating referrals and pre-approvals, you can access high-quality care with minimized out-of-pocket costs.

For military members and their families, knowing these details ahead of time can make the transition into treatment more straightforward and less stressful.",,N,0.0,2025-07-23 17:56:08.672065
,,2025-07-23 20:37:27+00:00,DVIDS,He was Given 6 Weeks to Live. That was in 2019. - DVIDS,Not Available,,,,,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/543657/he-given-6-weeks-live-2019,"It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.
“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said.
“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said.
Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.” Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition.
That’s reality.” Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.","U.S. Army Master Sgt. Jerry Millan lives life by two promises:

“I’m not done yet,” was his vow when Military Health System doctors gave him a lifechanging diagnosis—a rare cancer in his abdominal area, the “most aggressive cancer they've ever come across,” he said. It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.

The second, “I got you,” is his assurance to fellow service members he mentors that he’ll be there to support them and his fellow athletes as they prepare for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games.

Millan’s cancer has been in remission for over five years, and he shares his story of survival to encourage and lift up others facing difficult odds.

A Sudden Pain, A Grim Diagnosis

Millan, a special operations forces soldier, was participating in pre-deployment training in the woods of Fort Polk, Louisiana, when he hit the ground and felt a sharp pain in his gut. He thought it was just a hernia. A medic agreed and ordered a scan. The scan confirmed an umbilical hernia, but the military radiologist saw more.

“I just had this pain in my navel. It wasn’t a typical pain from exercise or indigestion; rather, something unfamiliar” Millan recalled. “But thanks to the radiologist—they saw multiple masses inside my abdomen.”

He was immediately sent to the Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where specialists identified Burkitt’s Lymphoma, an aggressive growing type of cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. He waited with his parents to find out the prognosis.

“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said. “I'm just sitting there looking at like the floor, my dad's sitting at the edge of the bed, and I started saying to myself, ‘I'm not done yet.’”

“It was just a decision to live.”

MHS and NIH Partner to Save his Life

Because Burkitt’s Lymphoma is rare, Walter Reed oncologists quickly linked Millan with doctors and researchers at the NIH who study the disease. The partnership gave him access to an experimental, high-dose chemotherapy protocol for six cycles.

“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said. “At the time, three doctors in network in the United States were trained on that type of cancer.”

Like the cancer, the treatment was aggressive.

“You’re given a massive dose of chemotherapy—I was on a 96-hour drip at first,” he said. “It was the harshest form of chemotherapy that has been developed. But you had to do it because the cancer, by that time, grew over 1000%. My gut was extremely distended.”

Besides the side effects of cancer treatments, he found the isolation to be an additional challenge. He was diagnosed just before the pandemic in 2020. Due to his severely compromised immune system and COVID-19, he was unable to be around people for the better part of a year. On top of that, the unit he trained so hard with deployed without him.

“My friends were deployed; I couldn't see my family. I couldn't have conversations face to face, it was: Wash your hands, wear your face shields, don’t touch each other,” he said.

His mental resilience was one of the key factors to his recovery. Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.”

Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition. They gave his mother a place to stay during treatment, arranged flights, and later linked him to educational resources and a staff position to let him continue serving while he healed.

They made sure his mother could focus on him and not on logistics. “She didn’t have to worry about anything,” Millan said. “She could just focus on me.”

After his chemotherapy rounds, doctors declared him cancer-free.

Finding New Strength Through Sports

Millan looked for what was next and returned to serving—yet struggled to navigate what his new duty looked like while in recovery.

“I felt like they really had no use for me. They had people that were deployable and ready to go. And I can’t. That’s reality.”

Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.

“The Military Adaptive Sports program provided me the opportunity to find a new purpose in life by helping others going through similar situations,” he said. “They helped me find a new community.”

He trained for powerlifting, rowing, sitting volleyball, track and field, and precision air sports. At his first DOD Warrior Games in 2022, he balanced competition with duty, commuting between his events in Orlando and his assignment at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. The camaraderie hooked him.

“Once I got to participate and train with the other athletes that were there, I learned about their stories and the things they’re going through,” he said. “It's like, wow, you know, there are other people out there in the military community … that all have their struggles, and they are facing their adversity.”

“Then I ended up finding this new community,” Millan added, “I didn’t realize how badly I needed that.”

He was invited to participate in the 2025 Invictus Games, where he took Gold in rowing. The togetherness, teamwork, and community inspired his second promise.

‘I Got You’

In the 2025 games, Millan will again wear Team SOCOM colors. He qualified for the “Ultimate Champion” category, a grueling slate of every individual event: powerlifting, cycling, swimming, archery, shooting, rowing, track and field, and volleyball. He uses his experience to help service members who are struggling, recruiting new athletes, visiting recovery units, and offering virtual coaching to anyone who needs it. He shares his message of recovery and support to uplift others.

“If you’re a teammate of mine, I got you,” he stresses. “I will come to you and walk you through the things that helped me. I’ll do this with you. I’ll tell them this is what I did that helped me. I didn't follow a guided path. I didn't have someone walking me through it. But if you're in my community … I got you.”

Health and Fitness Key to Recovery

As the WCP-CC East Region noncommissioned officer in charge, he is a liaison to U.S. Army Special Operations Command and visits the Soldier Recovery Unit twice a week. He demonstrates workouts, shares nutrition tips, and, most importantly, listens.

“I learn about their stories and the stuff they're going through,” Millan said. “I say, ‘here are the things that helped me to get through what I was going through.’ Maybe what I've learned in my own journey that could possibly help.”

“I just embrace it, and they embrace. That helps amplify any type of recovery,” he added.

To continue to keep his own health in check, he trains. He believes movement builds mood and resilience. A chemotherapy-induced heart issue demands top fitness, so he lifts, rows, and runs often.

“To build resilience, you have to build a routine,” he said. “Maybe you start with walking 20 minutes a day. Then it builds from there. Your body is meant to move.” For him, exercise helps his mental health. “My mood and my attitude are directly tied to how I feel.”

Millan maintains annual needed checkups through the care of his MHS team.

“I get labs and then I have specialty care for my heart,” he said. “I'm able to use these specialty clinics to help with issues I'm having from chemotherapy right on base.”

Millan refuses to let cancer define him, but it does define his new outlook—living by a new mantra:

“There’s more I want to do in life,” he said. “And I’m not done yet.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2502/8874038/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 17:56:12.075703

The medical facility annual training, or MFAT, is a unit-funded National Guard program that enables service members to maintain their mission-essential medical skills proficiency and clinical readiness tasks that Airmen are unable to complete at their home station.

Every year, medical groups from across the Air National Guard are ranked on their performance and bid on locations to complete an MFAT.

During the two-week event the Airmen honed their medical skills while serving alongside U.S. Navy Sailors and civilian medical providers at U.S. Naval Hospital (USNH) Naples, a Defense Health Agency facility which provides routine and emergency medical care for U.S. service members and their dependents stationed in the Mediterranean.

“This training event lets us vault our readiness,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Matt Murray, the 174th Medical Group’s medical administrative officer. “It also demonstrates our interoperability with another service.”

Located in southern Italy on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea, NSA Naples it is home to U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa and the U.S. Sixth Fleet. USNH Naples provides medical care for approximately 15,000 U.S. service members and 9,000 dependents and retirees.

“We don’t have a lot of visiting providers from other units coming in, so this is a change,” said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Claire-Marie Gould, the director of human resources for USNH Naples. “Most of our visiting providers are from the Navy, so this is a change.”

During the two-week MFAT, the New York Air National Guard Airmen augmented USNH Naples staffing levels which resulted in increased patient care capabilities.

New York Air National Guard physician assistants conducted surgical procedures, bio-environmental engineering conducted air and water quality testing, and dental teams performed exams and oral treatments.

“We only have one optometrist, so we have very limited access to care for optometry,” Gould said. ""With an Air Force optometrist here seeing patients, we could see patients that we would normally have to refer to the community network.”

In addition to providing increased patient care at USNH Naples, the Airmen conducted hands-on medical training they aren’t normally able to accomplish during drill weekends.

“At the 174th Medical Group, we are a non-treatment facility,” said Maj. Karen Marshall, a physician’s assistant assigned to the 174th Medical Group, 174th Attack Wing, New York Air National Guard. “We’re there to make sure that members are ready for duty mobility and fitness.”

Because the 174th Attack Wing doesn’t possess a treatment facility, the Airmen assigned to the 174th must work in other facilities to obtain their mandatory clinical hours.

“Everyone has been able to do their job, which has been amazing, because as a DSG or a traditional guardsman, we don’t always have the opportunity to get this type of training,” Murray said. “We’re very much focused on the readiness of everybody else but this is an opportunity to focus on us.”

In addition to working at USNH Naples for two weeks, the Air National Guardsmen also had the opportunity to experience some of the rich history and culture of Naples, Italy.

“These are the types of events that build morale,” Murray said. “They build camaraderie and they build teamwork. We’re very grateful to have the opportunity to come here and we’re grateful for NSA Naples for welcoming us.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9115189/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 19:56:08.497414

Pharmacy Patient Info & FAQ

Pharmacy Issues, Databases & Uploads

Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency (PUTT) is a non-profit advocacy organization founded by independent pharmacists and pharmacy owners devoted to exposing the truth about the anti-competitive tactics of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs – aka pharmacy benefit companies or PBCs ). Known to most Americans as their “prescription drug benefit plan” provider, PBMs are in reality a $300 billion industry – giant corporate middlemen driving up the cost of medications with huge mark ups and commissions on every prescription covered under their “benefits plan.”

​

Working with local and national traditional and digital media that includes The New York Times, USA Today, CBS News, Bloomberg, NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and Business Insider, PUTT seeks to educate patients, lawmakers, health plan sponsors and the public about the deeply negative effects of the PBM industry on U.S. healthcare and the escalating price of prescription medications.

PUTT serves as an industry watchdog, collecting evidence of PBM fraudulent practices and abuse and using this information to educate and inform consumers, taxpayers, employers and health plan sponsors of the truth about the unregulated, unmonitored PBM industry. Through PUTT’s efforts, PBMs have begun to experience greater public awareness and scrutiny of their actions and come under fire for questionable practices including the use of gag clauses at the pharmacy counter, gross over-billing of health plans (called “spread pricing”), forcing patients to use PBM-owned pharmacies instead of allowing patients to choose their own pharmacies and interjecting unnecessary bureaucratic practices such as prior authorizations between patients and their doctors in the matter of prescription refills.

Keep up with MOAA’s work in this and other advocacy areas by visiting our new-look Legislative Action Center. And check out these three key dates to the formation of your current health care coverage:

June 7, 1956

What: President Dwight D. Eisenhower signs the Dependents’ Medical Care Act of 1956.

So What: The law codifies the eligibility for space-available military treatment facility (MTF) care for active duty family members, retirees and their families, and survivors. It also establishes coverage for civilian medical care (with cost sharing) for active duty families. Eisenhower supported the legislation as part of his push to “strengthen the career service.”

Sept. 30, 1966

What: Congress approves the Military Medical Benefits Amendments, which provides civilian care coverage (with cost sharing) for working age retirees and would lead to the creation of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS).

So What: After Congress passed legislation creating Medicare in 1965, working age uniformed services retirees were the only beneficiary segment without coverage for civilian medical care. Congress responded with the Military Medical Benefits Amendments that extends civilian coverage to non-Medicare eligible retirees and their dependents. The amendments also allow DoD to contract with civilian facilities, greatly expanding care options for beneficiaries. In the mid-1990s, CHAMPUS would become TRICARE Standard.
