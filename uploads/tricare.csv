Developed in 2001 by U.S. Air Force Col. Richard Niemtzow as a rapid-relief option in deployed settings, battlefield acupuncture, or BFA, uses up to five tiny needles placed in the outer ear to help patients manage pain without sedatives or opioids.

BFA targets five specific auricular points to disrupt pain signals and stimulate the body’s natural healing response according to “Pinpoint precision: How Battlefield Acupuncture is reducing pain and boosting readiness,” a recent article posted to the Defense Health Agency website. The technique encourages the release of serotonin, dopamine, melatonin, and endorphins. The procedure is low risk, portable, and well suited for use in clinical and field settings.

At BJACH, BFA is administered by four trained primary care providers: Capt. Charles Rosado, physician; Danielle Craft, nurse practitioner; and certified physician assistants Henry Johnson and Willie Shelton.

“I consider use of battlefield acupuncture in both acute and chronic pain presentations,” Shelton said, noting its effectiveness in treating fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, anxiety and musculoskeletal pain when standard therapies have failed.

“The pain they’ve carried for years is suddenly gone — and they’re in tears from the relief,” he said.

Retired 1st Sgt. Thomas Washington began receiving BFA at BJACH two years ago after suffering from chronic back pain.

“Immediately — within the first five, ten minutes — I noticed relief,” Washington said. He now receives treatment every 14 days and encourages other patients to explore it as an option.

TRICARE Prime beneficiary Kathy Adams reported significant improvement in vocal strain, stress and shoulder pain after beginning BFA treatment, following nearly a year of speech therapy.

“It’s helped not just my voice, but also my stress and shoulder pain,” Adams said.

Studies from the Department of Veterans Affairs indicate that more than 75 percent of BFA recipients report immediate, short-term relief. The procedure does not impair cognitive function, does not involve medication, and can be administered quickly in a clinical setting.

BJACH providers may offer BFA as a standalone therapy or in combination with other treatments such as physical therapy, behavioral health services or medication management.

I did it for my kids thinking it would be better but the two insurance companies would just fight over who paid first. The other company tried everything to get out of paying first.

I have an employer sponsored plan stacked with Select and it’s kind of hit or miss. My primary has a really shitty out-of-network coverage policy (they won’t cover most things OON unless it’s an emergency), so it becomes a hassle trying to get Tricare to not deny those things as well on the premise that I “didn’t follow my primary insurance rules”, even if it’s something Tricare would generally cover. But when it’s in network for my primary, I pay nothing, not even copays because Tricare picks up the rest of the bill. It also comes in handy when you live in an area where there’s a limited number of specialists who take Tricare. Honestly though, the only reason I do it is because my employer health plan is free, but I’m planning on dropping my primary insurance during open enrollment this year. It’s just not worth the hassle to save ~$500 year in out of pocket costs.

Only reason I’m keeping the dental is because I need a bit of work done and United Concordia is a bit of a nightmare when it comes to what and how much it covers (so I’ve heard, haven’t used it yet) so my dentist recommended to keep them both.",,N,-1.0,2025-07-01 18:56:31.641683

Smokeless tobacco use is also prevalent, with 9 percent of veteran and current service member students at postsecondary institutions reporting smokeless tobacco use in 2018.
Tobacco harm reduction (THR) approaches, which involve substituting cigarettes with lower-risk nicotine products like smokeless tobacco or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are less emphasized within VA programs.
While THR research shows potential for those resistant to quitting, VA programs and policies heavily favor traditional approaches.
The VA should continue to support trials comparing THR to existing methods and expand harm reduction approaches for veterans who smoke.","Approximately 11 percent of veterans presenting for first-time care at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities meet criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD), compared to 8.6 percent of the general population. This difference is more pronounced in specific subgroups, such as veterans with combat exposure or co-occurring mental health disorders. For example, 20 percent of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also have an SUD, and 63 percent of recent Afghanistan/Iraq veterans with SUDs meet PTSD criteria. The lifetime prevalence of SUDs among veterans is estimated at 53 percent—significantly higher than the general population rate of approximately 17 percent. The VA offers a robust suite of SUD services including screening, outpatient and inpatient treatment, harm reduction, and specialized programs for veterans of Middle East conflicts, women veterans, and veterans from rural areas. These programs help reduce mortality, improve SUD and mental health symptoms, and address social needs like homelessness.

Tobacco use among U.S. veterans also remains a significant health concern. Data from the 2010-2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows that 29.2 percent of veterans reported using tobacco, with cigarettes (21.6 percent) being the most common, followed by cigars (6.2 percent) and smokeless tobacco (5.2 percent). Younger veterans (18-25 years old) showed the highest rates at 56.8 percent, influenced by factors like low income, lack of insurance, and psychological distress. Tobacco use in the Military Health System (MHS) declined from 2016 to 2022 but saw a slight uptick in the last two years. Military culture, deployment stress, and targeted tobacco industry marketing contribute to these elevated rates. Studies like the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study highlight that veterans, especially younger ones, use both cigarettes and non-cigarette products like e-cigarettes at higher rates than non-veterans. Smokeless tobacco use is also prevalent, with 9 percent of veteran and current service member students at postsecondary institutions reporting smokeless tobacco use in 2018. Cessation efforts face challenges, with counseling rates declining in the MHS.

The VA primarily focuses on traditional tobacco cessation approaches, emphasizing complete abstinence through counseling, pharmacotherapy (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], varenicline, bupropion), and digital tools like SmokefreeVET and Quit VET. While these approaches achieve some success, combat exposure and PTSD increase relapse risks. Tobacco harm reduction (THR) approaches, which involve substituting cigarettes with lower-risk nicotine products like smokeless tobacco or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are less emphasized within VA programs.

Research suggests a multipronged approach—including harm reduction strategies—for veterans with schizophrenia that employs atypical antipsychotics, NRT, and bupropion to reduce cigarette consumption progressively; however, its effectiveness has not been fully evaluated. A 2010 study of Air Force personnel, including some transitioning to veteran status, found that 87 percent of smokers who initiated smokeless tobacco use post-training escalated harm (e.g., dual use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco) rather than reducing it, with only 16 percent achieving the full benefits of tobacco harm reduction by switching entirely to smokeless tobacco. While this suggests THR’s potential, it also highlights the risks of dual use, which could undermine health benefits compared to VA’s abstinence-focused programs.

VA policies promote NRT and counseling without mentioning THR alternatives like ENDS. The barriers to THR adoption are significant, including concerns about the long-term safety of smokeless tobacco and regulatory restrictions on ENDS, which remain unaddressed in current VA guidelines. While THR research shows potential for those resistant to quitting, VA programs and policies heavily favor traditional approaches. The VA should continue to support trials comparing THR to existing methods and expand harm reduction approaches for veterans who smoke. Modernizing the VA’s tobacco cessation policies in a similar manner to how the agency has embraced harm reduction approaches in treating other SUDs would provide veterans with a larger toolkit to improve their personal health.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Military-Army-Conflict-BOATFOTO.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-01 14:56:26.051484

This collaboration enables the Military Health System to receive life-saving blood products from the Red Cross, while expanding Red Cross blood drives on military installations and even aboard ships. The result: more opportunities for generous donors to give blood and a stronger, more resilient blood supply for both military and civilian communities.

“This partnership is a game-changer,” said Dr. Mary Ann Spott, acting director of the Armed Services Blood Program. “Together, we’re ensuring that our service members—whether in combat operations, in military hospitals, or on domestic bases —have access to the blood they need, while also reinforcing the civilian healthcare system.”

“The Red Cross has a long history of supporting our service members and we are honored to expand our support to help those in need of vital blood transfusions,” said Micah Holliman, director of national partnerships for American Red Cross Blood Services. “We are at our strongest when we come together. Blood donation is a simple yet powerful act of patriotism and compassion.”

The Red Cross, ASBP, and the Department of Defense share a unified mission: to meet the blood needs of active-duty service members in times of peace and conflict. Now more than ever, this partnership enhances that mission by ensuring our nation is always prepared with a reliable, responsive blood supply that supports military operations and saves lives.

Every two seconds someone needs a blood transfusion. All blood types are needed on an ongoing basis, but of greatest immediate need is Type O blood which doctors reach for in emergency situations. Type O negative is the universal type and Type O positive can be safely transfused to approximately 80 percent of the population. Individuals of all types, especially those with type O blood, are urged to make an appointment to donate in the coming weeks to help ensure a strong supply this summer. To find a blood drive or schedule a donation, use the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visit RedCrossBlood.org, or call 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767).

All who come to give July 1-14, 2025, will get an exclusive pair of Red Cross x goodr sunglasses, while supplies last. Donors can personalize their one-of-a-kind shades with a blood type sticker! For details, visit RedCrossBlood.org/goodr.

This Independence Day, let us unite in the American spirit of giving and give the gift of life. One American nation. One lifesaving mission. One drop at a time.

More Ways to Give, More Lives to Save

“Working in a hospital setting in patient administration, I see firsthand how critical blood donations are,” said Captain Bryan Wallace who donated blood for the first time at a Red Cross blood drive at Maxwell Air Force Base in May. “When I saw this awesome opportunity, I thought, what better time to give than now?”

Military spouses, retirees, and government civilians with base access can now donate blood at either ASBP or Red Cross drives without leaving the installation. Service members at sea will also have more chances to donate while deployed. And civilians who give blood at public Red Cross drives may support military personnel by helping maintain a robust community blood supply which will be shared with the military when needed.

“Every donation is a lifeline,” said Holliman. “Whether it’s a soldier overseas, a veteran at home, or a patient in a local hospital, your blood donation makes a difference.""

A Legacy of Service

This partnership builds on the long-standing Red Cross Services to the Armed Forces program, which helps members of the military, veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors prepare for, cope with, and respond to the challenges of military service, both in the U.S. and abroad.

Maintaining a global presence on more than 100 military installations and deployment sites worldwide, the Red Cross provides communication between service members and their families during times of emergency. The Red Cross also aims to improve the health and wellness of people in the military community through behavioral health and wellness workshops, hospital, clinic and peer support programs and the provision of care, comfort, and therapy items.

About Blood Donation

A blood donor card or driver’s license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements.

Blood and platelet donors can save time at their next donation by using RapidPass® to complete their pre-donation reading and health history questionnaire online, on the day of their donation, before arriving at the blood drive. To get started, follow the instructions at RedCrossBlood.org/RapidPass or use the Blood Donor App.

Unlock your health by understanding the types of care—and when to use them—to make better choices for you and your family.

Emergency care

If your life, limb, or eyesight is at risk, you’re having a medical emergency. Chest pain, trouble breathing, severe bleeding, and broken bones are examples of emergencies that need immediate attention. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

TRICARE covers emergency care anywhere in the world. You also don’t need a referral or pre-authorization to get it. However, for TRICARE Prime, you should contact your primary care manager within 24 hours—or the next business day—after receiving care. You may also need a referral for any follow-up treatment to avoid out-of-pocket costs.

Urgent care—but not an emergency

Not every issue is an emergency, but that doesn’t mean it can wait. Urgent care is for conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t emergencies.

Most TRICARE plans allow you to visit any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center without a referral, but it all depends on your plan and beneficiary group. Certain rules apply if you’re active duty or enrolled in a TRICARE overseas plan, so be sure to check ahead of time.

If you’re unsure about the seriousness of your symptoms, the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line is available 24/7. If you live overseas, call your TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center.

Routine care

Routine or primary care is the foundation of everyday health. Whether it’s a routine physical, managing chronic conditions, or a lingering cough, your PCM is your first point of contact. These providers know your medical history and can treat a wide variety of conditions and follow ups—or refer you to a specialist if needed.

Use the Find a Doctor Tool to locate a provider near you.

Specialty care

Sometimes, your health concern requires care from a provider who’s trained in a specific area of medicine. Specialists—like cardiologists, neurologists, or dermatologists—can diagnose and treat more complex conditions within their field.

Depending on your plan, you may need a referral to see a specialist. With TRICARE Prime, for example, you need a referral from your PCM. If your plan doesn’t require one, you can schedule directly with a TRICARE-authorized provider. If you’re unsure, the TRICARE Customer Service Directory is a good place to start.

(Note: If you’re enrolled in TRICARE Prime in the West Region, the specialty care referral approval waiver expired June 30. Starting July 1, you should follow all normal referral processes according to the rules of your TRICARE plan.)

Preventive care

You don’t have to be sick to see a health care provider. Preventive care—like cancer screenings, immunizations, and well-child care—are key to long-term health and readiness. Even when you feel fine, these services can catch problems early or help prevent them altogether.

TRICARE covers a wide range of preventive services. What’s more, you’ll have no cost for these services when received from a network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet.

Be prepared

By: Richard L. Smith

According to information released by the U.S. Department of Justice, federal authorities have charged multiple individuals and reached civil settlements with healthcare providers and companies—some based in New Jersey—as part of a national effort to combat health care fraud schemes targeting Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers.

In total, 15 defendants connected to the District of New Jersey were charged or settled allegations as part of the DOJ’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown.

The coordinated enforcement action involved over 300 individuals across the country and addressed more than $14.6 billion in intended fraud.

Among the New Jersey-related matters:

• Alan Vaughan, 56, of the United Kingdom, was charged with conspiracy to pay illegal kickbacks in a scheme involving cancer genetic testing and durable medical equipment. Vaughan allegedly routed millions in kickbacks through a shell company in New Zealand, resulting in more than $80 million in losses to Medicare.

• Taejin Kim, 43, a licensed physical therapist from River Vale, was charged with conspiring to submit fraudulent claims to Amtrak’s healthcare plan for services never rendered. The scheme caused over $2.2 million in losses.

• Nestor E. Jaime, 36, of Pine Brook, and the owner of a pharmacy, is accused of submitting false Medicare claims for expensive drugs that were neither prescribed nor dispensed. Medicare paid his pharmacy over $2.5 million in connection with the alleged fraud.

• Newark Beth Israel Medical Center agreed to pay $250,000 to settle allegations that its Heart Transplant Program performed medically unnecessary procedures between 2018 and 2019 by failing to provide critical health information to patients and their families.

Several New Jersey pharmacies and dental groups also settled allegations involving fraudulent claims:

• Excel Pharmacy Inc. (Jersey City): $3 million

• QuickRx LLC/Community Pharmacy (Elizabeth): $962,821

• Raghu Ram Inc./Camden Discount Pharmacy (Camden): $310,000

• Rachit Drug Inc. (Newark): $225,000

• Premier Dental Holdings and affiliates: $540,000 for billing violations involving uncredentialed providers.

These actions reflect a broader federal initiative to dismantle fraudulent operations in the healthcare industry.

Officials emphasized the gravity of the threat and the collaborative effort among federal and state agencies.

The cases in New Jersey are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys from the District of New Jersey, and investigations were conducted by federal health care fraud task forces in coordination with HHS-OIG, FBI, and other law enforcement agencies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center (JPMRC) rotation 25-01 in Hawaii and Salakanib-Balikatan (SABAK) 25 Pacific Pathways rotation in the Philippines, Task Force Gimlet successfully implemented and tested “Tactical Behavior Telehealth (TBT). TBT allows Soldiers in tactical environments, with limited access to care, to virtually connect with healthcare professionals. Building on successful telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic, this testing moved the concept into a field environment.[1]

Modern technology expands healthcare access, particularly in areas where it was previously limited. TBT works by enabling Soldiers at a Role 1 facility to use devices like iPads or computers to connect with Embedded Behavioral Health (EBH) personnel at Role 2 or higher locations via a Military Health System (MHS) video conferencing platform.[2] Research indicates that Soldiers report similar satisfaction levels with virtual and in-person behavioral health treatment.[3]

As one medical professional journal noted, today’s technology can “expand the geographic reach of health care services and improve access to care” that may not have been possible before.[4] Specifically, readily available data transports now allow units to access “reach-back” resources and potentially reduce the need for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). This is especially valuable in the Pacific region, where units may operate in archipelagos with limited and dispersed resources.

Recognizing that EBH resources would not deploy with the unit and accounting for the geographical dispersion of the unit during SABAK 25, the UMT focused on TBT as a critical resource. Ultimately, the team’s goal was to enable Soldiers to connect with specialty behavioral health providers to support real-world situations requiring assessment and treatment.

METHOD

During JPMRC 25-01 and SABAK 25, the Task Force Gimlet Unit Ministry Team (UMT) tested the TBT concept. The team aimed to verify the efficacy and connectivity of MHS Video Connect across all available data transports and establish virtual sessions from Role 1 to behavioral health providers at Role 2.

RESULTS

During the JPMRC 25-01 rotation, the UMT tested the capability to deliver behavioral health care remotely using MHS Video Connect over available secure data transports, including cellular telecommunication enabled devices (MiFi pucks) and low Earth orbit satellite networks (Storm and Starlink). Even though Starlink was the only system that could provide sufficient bandwidth to support a stable video connection, early stages of fielding and implementation limited the number points the unit could access.

The unit was able to successfully conduct a virtual session with behavioral health providers, but personnel had to relocate to Starlink access points, because it was not available at Role 1 or Role 2 locations.

Throughout JPMRC 25-01, Role 1 personnel performed psychological triage on a total of three Soldiers and determined that each of them needed next level of care for behavioral health assessment and treatment. Additionally, all three required ground MEDEVAC transport between Role 1 and Role 2, which were separated by approximately 20 miles. The Soldiers remained overnight at the Role 2 facility so providers could complete assessment and treatment. One Soldier required evacuation to Role 3 (Tripler Army Medical Center) for advanced care, while two returned to duty after treatment at the Role 2. Role 2 specialists could have used TBT to initially assess these patients virtually, potentially conserving MEDEVAC resources. Had TBT been available, the two return to duty Soldiers could have received treatment from Role 1 personnel under the guidance of Role 2 specialists.

Several months later, TF Gimlet deployed to the Philippines in support of SABAK 25 without EBH personnel. This made TBT with Schofield Barracks the primary method for deployed Soldiers to access behavioral health specialty care. The unit received additional Starlink systems, resulting in dedicated data connections at the co-located Role 1/2. During deployment, TF Gimlet used TBT to connect Soldiers to EBH specialty providers in response to three real-world situations:

Situation 1: A Soldier experienced a traumatic event early in the deployment that triggered multiple adverse symptoms. Following interventions conducted by the unit chaplain and Role 1/2 medical personnel, it was determined that the patient required next-level care. The patient was able to successfully connect with a specialty provider via MHS Video Connect for further assessment and treatment. He conducted regular virtual appointments with a provider and remained on deployment until the first scheduled main body redeployment.

Situation 2: A senior leader already receiving care from EBH experienced an intense onset of symptoms partway through the deployment. He was able to resume treatment with his assigned specialty provider via MHS Video Connect.

Scenario 3: A Soldier exhibiting possible suicidal ideations was brought to Role 1/2. Following initial assessment, a specialist virtually connected to evaluate the patient and determined the Soldier was unfit to remain on deployment and arranged for redeployment and escort to Tripler Army Medical Center. Following treatment, the patient returned to duty with the unit’s rear detachment.

INTEGRATING TELEBEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS

TBT offers significant potential to deliver specialized behavioral care for remote operational environments, mirroring the successful implementation in garrison locations and veteran care facilities.[5] As commanders and medical personnel plan for large-scale combat operations, they should include TBT as a solution to manage potential surges in casualties and conserve resources.[6]

TBT proved invaluable during TF Gimlet’s dispersed operations in the Pacific Theater (SABAK 25), connecting Soldiers with behavioral health providers when in-person care was impossible.

To further enhance TBT, we recommend exploring additional low-bandwidth virtual tools through initiatives like the Army Software Factory, Army Application Lab (AAL), or “Hacking for Defense (H4D).” Successfully implementing TBT at the point of need requires coordinated planning between medical, signal, and operations teams to create a virtual “mesh network” of providers that enables a hybrid care model across distances.

I am an AD dependent on tricare prime. I received a referral to a civilian hospital for my pregnancy/delivery.

I recently received a bill from the hospital for inpatient services. I had a normal delivery and didn’t request any services beyond the referral (ie delivered vaginally and didn’t have an elective c section). When I called tricare they said I am responsible for 20% of the charges. I explained I am on prime, am an AD dependent, and went to the hospital they referred me to. According to their website I didn’t think I owed anything (https://tricare.mil/Costs/Compare). Representative said it didn’t matter, I still owe 20% of the bill.

Anyone else have experience with this or know anything about this process?

I am going to talk to the patient advocate tomorrow but wanted to be as informed as possible beforehand. Thanks!",,N,-1.0,2025-07-01 00:56:22.787524

According to United States Attorney Alina Habba, Excel Pharmacy, located at 721 Newark Ave., will make the payment to settle allegations that it defrauded Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and private health insurers.

The lawsuit alleged that from January 2, 2015, through January 25, 2022, Excel submitted claims for reimbursement to the Medicare Part D Program and the New Jersey Medicaid Program for drugs that were never dispensed to beneficiaries.

The charges and settlement filed in federal court are part of the Department of Justice’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown.

The case, which included 15 defendants, involved physicians and pharmacies submitting reimbursements for drugs, devices, and tests that patients didn’t need, pharmacies seeking reimbursement for drugs they never sold, and healthcare providers who received kickbacks to drive phony prescriptions.

“My Office, in lockstep with the Department’s nationwide Health Care Fraud Takedown, is cracking down on corrupt physicians, pharmacies, and healthcare providers who exploit Medicare and Medicaid with shameless kickback schemes, unnecessary prescriptions, and phony reimbursements for unneeded drugs, medical devices, and genetic tests – or drugs never even delivered,” said U.S. Attorney Habba. “These predatory schemes prioritize profits over patients, and the District of New Jersey is fiercely committed to rooting out this fraud and ensuring those responsible face justice.”",https://i0.wp.com/jcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/arpad-czapp-tvP6pCnq9iI-unsplash-scaled-e1748529510418.jpg?fit=1200%2C676&ssl=1,N,0.0,2025-06-30 23:56:17.446901

Sleep apnea is not just a medical condition—it’s a force readiness issue.
The findings highlight how untreated sleep disorders contribute to mental health challenges, traumatic injuries, and increased health care utilization in our service members.
Our collaboration with UMSOM underscores the urgent need to enhance access to timely, effective, and evidence-based sleep care throughout the Military Health System.
Military members across all branches, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Space Force, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, were analyzed in the study.","With more than 1 in 10 Americans suffering from obstructive sleep apnea putting them at increased risk of heart problems and other health ills, a new study conducted by the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) carefully analyzed the toll that this sleep disorder takes on U.S. active-duty military members, and their analysis was alarming: They found that soldiers with sleep apnea who are serving on the front lines are more than four times more likely to experience post traumatic stress disorder and three times more likely to suffer a traumatic brain injury compared to those who don’t have the condition.

Highlights of the comprehensive study were recently published in the journal CHEST. Conducted in conjunction with Uniformed Services University, the study marks the largest analysis of sleep apnea’s health effects and its burden on health resources in the U.S. military.

“This study underscores the growing importance of early intervention in sleep apnea and access to high quality, cost-effective sleep care for service members,” said Emerson M. Wickwire, PhD, lead study author and Section Chief of Sleep Medicine of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “By quantifying the health and resource burden of this condition we hope to help guide the development and allocation of clinical resources within the military health system, including advancing provider education and patient screening, triage, and treatment.”

Obstructive sleep apnea is among the most common sleep disorders, causing sleep disruptions that raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attack, stroke and depression. The condition is characterized as a breathing disorder in which breathing stops and restarts throughout sleep. Common symptoms can include chronic snoring, daytime sleepiness, as well as mood and behavior changes.

Due to the demanding nature of military work schedules and non-traditional hours, only one-third of active-duty service members obtain the minimum recommended seven or more hours of sleep per night, according to previous research. There is also a growing awareness of sleep apnea in the military with diagnoses increasing well over ten-fold between 2005 and 2019, from 11 to 333 cases per 10,000 service members.

To conduct the latest study, Dr. Wickwire and his colleagues utilized de-identified data from the Military Health System data repository to create two matched cohorts of individuals with and without obstructive sleep apnea, comprised of nearly 60,000 service members each, ages 17-64. Service members with newly diagnosed sleep apnea were matched with those without controlling for demographic, clinical and military characteristics. The researchers found that during the 12 months following diagnosis, service members with sleep apnea had an additional 170,511 outpatient visits to doctors compared to their counterparts and also an additional 1,852 emergency department visits per year and 66 hospitalizations.

They also had a higher risk and faster time to specific medical problems including:

With the hopes to address the documented shortage of sleep specialists in the military health system, UMSOM and USU are working together to launch a new clinical trial called “Tele-Sleep OSA” to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of tele-health visits for military beneficiaries who are diagnosed with the condition.

“We are eager to begin enrolling patients in this important study to help improve overall health outcomes in our U.S. military population,” said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K.

While national defense is a top priority, an increase in funding without reform risks repeating past mistakes at the taxpayers’ expense.
Any defense budget increases should be paired with concrete steps to improve how the Pentagon manages its resources.
Secretary Hegseth discusses how the Defense Department “has become very much overreliant on management consultants and contractors .
These steps would rein in spending and bring greater transparency to a costly category of the defense budget.","The Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 budget proposes a $961.6 billion budget for the Department of Defense, an increase of $113.3 billion or 13.35% from FY 2025. On top of that, Congress is considering additional defense funding through the reconciliation bill, likely bringing national security discretionary spending over $1 trillion for the first time ever.

While national defense is a top priority, an increase in funding without reform risks repeating past mistakes at the taxpayers’ expense. Without accountability, even well-intended funding becomes vulnerable to fraud and wasteful spending.

Any defense budget increases should be paired with concrete steps to improve how the Pentagon manages its resources. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently released a report with 79 priority recommendations for the DoD aimed at eliminating fraud, improving efficiency, and restoring fiscal discipline.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has promised to “clean house” at the Pentagon and has already announced a 20% cut to top general and flag officer positions, along with plans to streamline the force structure and rein in contractor overuse. While these early moves are promising, true reform depends on implementing deeper structural fixes like those recommended by the GAO. Below, we highlight seven practical and impactful reforms from the report that the Pentagon, with guidance from lawmakers, can implement immediately to protect taxpayers and strengthen transparency.

1) Improving Financial Management

The Department of Defense has never passed a full financial audit, and the Pentagon has failed seven in a row. A key reason is poor tracking of its assets like buildings, equipment, and inventory. Outdated IT systems and missing records make it impossible to track where all the money is going.

The GAO recommends investing in better IT systems, verifying assets, and using fraud detection tools. These changes would reduce waste, improve oversight, and finally move the Pentagon toward a clean audit, something every major agency is already expected to do.

2) Reining in F-35 Sustainment Waste

The F-35 fighter jet program will cost an estimated $1.3 trillion over its lifetime, mostly due to heavy reliance on outside contractors. The military doesn’t control key data systems, making it harder and more expensive to maintain the fleet.

The GAO recommends shifting sustainment work back in-house to save costs and increase readiness. Greater control would reduce contractor fees and help taxpayers get more value from one of the Pentagon’s most expensive programs.

3) Fixing Improper TRICARE and Military Health Payments

The DoD provides healthcare to over 9 million individuals through Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and TRICARE. The GAO found that this fragmented care system alongside improper payments leads to potentially millions of taxpayers’ dollars wasted.

By identifying the root causes of billing errors, increasing oversight of clinical quality, and assessing workforce changes, the DoD can eliminate overpayments and simplify a split care system. Veterans, military personnel, and their families deserve better services without spending more.

4) Reducing Contract Waste and Duplication

The Pentagon spends billions on service contracts each year, often without enough oversight. Secretary Hegseth discusses how the Defense Department “has become very much overreliant on management consultants and contractors . . . We found that we likely have more contractors than we have civilian employees.” The GAO flags overreliance on contractors as a high-risk area, citing mismanagement in weapon systems acquisition and contract oversight.

To fix this, the GAO urges better acquisition policies, stronger forecasting, and clearer contract management. Without reform, failures such as 12 of 24 critical IT systems going over budget or the logistics program that went $815 million over budget will continue to exist. Strengthening oversight of operational contracts would help reduce inefficiencies and fix a fragmented management system. These steps would rein in spending and bring greater transparency to a costly category of the defense budget.

5) Addressing “Forever Chemicals” (PFAS) Liability

The DoD faces significant financial exposure to “forever chemicals” contamination. Yet, it still hasn’t assessed the full cost of cleanup, leaving taxpayers vulnerable to unlimited future liabilities.

The GAO urges DoD to calculate its exposure and create a cleanup plan with clear funding limits. Without action, Congress may end up writing blank checks. Planning now would protect public health while containing long-term costs.

6) Improving Cybersecurity and Oversight

The GAO report finds that the current cybersecurity system is incomplete and fragmented, leaving critical networks exposed and driving up costs. GAO found that basic protections are poorly implemented across the Department.

To fix this, GAO recommends stronger cyber hygiene, better planning, and clear oversight of risk decisions. Without urgent improvements, the DoD risks costly breaches and continued waste in programs that handle trillions of dollars.

7) Avoiding Infrastructure Waste

The DoD manages over 700,000 buildings and facilities worldwide worth roughly $2.2 trillion. Yet, its facility management is weak, and infrastructure data is incomplete or unreliable. Hundreds of billions of dollars are earmarked for barracks, housing, and repairs, but, without tracking quality or contracting results, this money is easily wasted or underutilized.

GAO recommends improving data systems, monitoring housing quality, and enforcing contract standards. These steps would ensure that maintenance funds are used effectively and that service members and their families live in safe, well-managed facilities.

Conclusion

GAO’s report outlines a clear blueprint to fix the Pentagon’s most persistent and costly failures. Yet, despite agreeing in principle with many of GAO’s recommendations, the Department of Defense continues to fall short in implementation. Progress has been slow, inconsistent, and in some cases nonexistent—especially in critical areas like cybersecurity, financial tracking, and contractor oversight.

This mixed response makes it clear that simply throwing more money at the Pentagon won’t solve its problems and is an urgent reminder for the need for continued congressional oversight to turn reform plans into impactful outcomes. Defense spending must not be exempt from scrutiny. Implementing just these seven GAO recommendations would help reduce waste, improve transparency, and help the DoD efficiently spend taxpayer dollars. This isn’t about budgeting, it’s about ensuring the DoD engages in responsible governance and uses taxpayers’ money effectively.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2018/05/The-Pentagon-January-2008.jpg?v=20230919100900,N,0.0,2025-06-30 16:56:33.786570

For career fields, where it is deemed necessary to ensure adequate skill, performance, and safety, the military services promote physical fitness programs that incorporate occupationally specific physical fitness requirements,” Shell said.
“Physical readiness standards are based on scientific research and establish both health-based criteria and operational physical performance-based criteria for physical fitness.
“It is important that DOD standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or MOS-specific task criteria,” Shell said.
This information gives the DOD the ability to measure and correlate injuries with failure and pass rates for body composition and physical fitness, Shell explained.","Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a directive on March 12, 2025, describing the start of a “rapid” cross-force review of changes in physical fitness and body composition standards since Jan. 1, 2015. The secretary followed up on this order on April 24, 2025, signing a memorandum directing a 30-day review of medical conditions that disqualify individuals from joining the military—calling for applicants to “be physically and mentally able to perform their duties under the harshest of conditions without risk to themselves or others,"" Hegseth said in a video posted on Department of Defense social media accounts.

As the DOD reviews these requirements, the focus on service member fitness is emerging at the forefront—and experts in the Military Health System offer advice on potential solutions.

“Each military service has different operational requirements, and it is important to understand those differences,” said Dr. Donald Shell, director of the Disease Prevention, Disease Management, and Population Health Policy and Oversight program in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.

“’Overweight’ does not necessarily equal ‘overfat,’ particularly on the individual level. Two individuals that have the same weight and height may have different types of mass (for example, muscle vs. fat) and exhibit different levels of physical performance and different levels of health risks,” Shell said at a federal health symposium in spring 2025 where he discussed obesity in the military.

“It is important that standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or military occupational specialty (MOS)-specific task criteria,” Shell said.

Fitness Policies are a ‘Frame’ to Build On

“Military service fitness tests, at minimum, address the primary physical fitness components of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and body composition for all military service applications. For career fields, where it is deemed necessary to ensure adequate skill, performance, and safety, the military services promote physical fitness programs that incorporate occupationally specific physical fitness requirements,” Shell said.

“Physical readiness standards are based on scientific research and establish both health-based criteria and operational physical performance-based criteria for physical fitness. Physical fitness and body composition testing programs promote readiness by emphasizing necessary physical capabilities, minimizing injuries, and meeting military service-specific operational mission requirements,” he explained.

“It is important that DOD standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or MOS-specific task criteria,” Shell said. “Standards exist to promote physical readiness and motivate healthy fitness behaviors. For instance, higher muscle mass and high performance is preferred over poor nutrition and unhealthy habits.”

Announced on April 25, 2025, the U.S. Army updated its fitness test to strengthen readiness and lethality. Phased implementation of the Army Fitness Test began June 1, 2025, with new scoring standards for active duty soldiers in 21 combat military occupational specialties taking effect on January 1, 2026. The five-event test will be “sex-neutral and age-normed.”

Muscle and Bone Injuries Are Top Reason for Mission Absence

Musculoskeletal injuries, such as sprained knees or torn ligaments, affect military readiness, unit cohesion, rank progression, and other facets required of a deployment-ready force. “There is a consistent association in the literature between obesity and musculoskeletal injuries,” Shell noted. The military has documented that these injuries remain the No. 1 reason service members are held back from missions or suffer permanent disability. For example, active duty soldiers experienced more than 3.6 million musculoskeletal injuries over a 9-year period from 2008 to 2017.

The DOD Instruction 1308.03 on physical fitness and body composition added muscle and bone-related injury monitoring across the military in March 2022. This information gives the DOD the ability to measure and correlate injuries with failure and pass rates for body composition and physical fitness, Shell explained.

Obesity and the Military

Just as in the civilian world, increased muscle and bone-injury rates are tied to the epidemic of obesity, according to Shell. Estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that obesity-related conditions cost the U.S. healthcare system nearly $173 billion a year. For the DOD, the per-year average increase in cost for obesity is estimated at $540 per person, which includes paying for diseases and conditions related to obesity, like heart diseases, high-blood pressure, and diabetes.

Shell said that in the March 2025 issue of “Lancet,” a leading weekly peer-reviewed medical journal, a special commission’s review of global obesity identified diagnostic criteria of clinical obesity in adults, adolescents, and children, which include recurrent or chronic severe knee pain, reduced range of motion, and limitations of mobility. This is not only a challenge for recruitment, but can significantly impact retention, readiness, and one’s ability to be worldwide deployable.

Recognizing that weight can change over time due to age or duty stations, all service branches have programs service members can use to lose weight and improve their fitness through lifestyle changes and diet and exercise. There are also initiatives aimed at helping potential recruits get in shape before they join, such as the U.S. Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course.

Nutrition and Exercise are ‘Foundation’ of Fitness

Physical fitness and optimum body weight composition should be based on a “foundation” of heart healthy exercise and nutrition, according to Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland.

He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum service member fitness and heart health.

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect: Move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Most service members should “really be doing three to four days in the gym [focusing on] large-muscle groups to maintain their strength.” This helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

Aerobic exercise maintains heart health and should include “150 to 300 minutes of moderate activity that makes you breath heavy, but you can still carry on a conversation. If you push to a level of exertion where you can’t talk, or vigorous activity, then the target is half that of moderate,” said Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.”

“The best exercise is what you do and what you enjoy, and what you see results from. You don't have to follow specific routines,” he added. “You have to follow something that you'll habituate to, and you'll do regularly.”

It's important to remember food is fuel for the warfighter, said Franzos. “You have to recognize those times that you're giving to yourself some grace, you're giving yourself … cheesecake … but also recognize that the bulk of the time you've got to really focus on healthy eating to ensure that you stay fit for the fight.”

Losing weight is hard to begin with, Franzos said. “Generally, when we put people on calorie-counting diets and put a lot of other physical effort in, we're seeing no more than 3–5% weight loss. And, oftentimes, that weight loss isn't maintained over time.”

Instead, he suggested staying fit, not fat, in the first place by cooking at home or in the barracks rather than eating out. Eating this way is “going to be better for your physical performance, because you're going to be able to control a lot of the macronutrients that are coming into your body, so that you minimize the bad fats and maximize the good proteins to perform better.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8932457/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-30 16:56:38.055478

The larger, nationwide Takedown involved federal and state law enforcement agencies across the country and represents an unprecedented effort to combat health care fraud schemes that exploit patients and taxpayers.

“Health care fraud costs this country billions of taxpayer dollars every year,” said U.S. Attorney Pirro. “This office fights rigorously, every day to uncover the fraud and abuse that steal precious resources from programs like these. To the thieves who are engaging in these fraud schemes: you think you’ve discovered how to walk away with free money; but we will find you and you will walk away with a new label - ‘convicted felon’.”

“This record-setting Health Care Fraud Takedown delivers justice to criminal actors who prey upon our most vulnerable citizens and steal from hardworking American taxpayers,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “Make no mistake – this administration will not tolerate criminals who line their pockets with taxpayer dollars while endangering the health and safety of our communities.”

Demonstrating the significant return on investment that results from health care fraud enforcement efforts, the government seized over $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency, and other assets as part of the coordinated enforcement efforts. As part of the whole-of-government approach to combating health care fraud announced today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also announced that it successfully prevented over $4 billion from being paid in response to false and fraudulent claims and that it suspended or revoked the billing privileges of 205 providers in the months leading up to the Takedown. Civil charges against 20 defendants for $14.2 million in alleged fraud, as well as civil settlements with 106 defendants totaling $34.3 million, were also announced as part of the Takedown.

Today’s Takedown was led and coordinated by the Health Care Fraud Unit of the Department of Justice Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and its core partners from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The cases were investigated by agents from HHS-OIG, FBI, DEA, and other federal and state law enforcement agencies. The cases are being prosecuted by Health Care Fraud Strike Force teams from the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, 50 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide, and 12 State Attorneys General Offices.

""Defrauding the American health care system is not a victimless crime,"" said Assistant Director in Charge Steven J. Jensen of the FBI Washington Field Office. ""It raises health insurance premiums, exposes patients to unnecessary medical procedures, and can lead to identity theft. Every dollar stolen is one fewer that's available to pay for needed care. The FBI will continue our relentless pursuit of those committing health care fraud and hold them accountable for their crimes.""

“The scale of today’s Takedown is unprecedented, and so is the harm we’re confronting. Individuals who attempt to steal from the federal health care system and put vulnerable patients at risk will be held accountable,” said HHS-OIG Acting Inspector General Juliet T. Hodgkins. “Our agents at HHS-OIG work relentlessly to detect, investigate, and dismantle these fraud schemes. We are proud to stand with our law enforcement partners in protecting taxpayer dollars and safeguarding patient care.”

The following individuals were charged in the District of Columbia:

Amstrong Chapajong, of Cheverly, Maryland, is charged with one count of health care fraud in connection with an overlapping billing scheme that allegedly defrauded the District of Columbia’s Medicaid program. As alleged in the information, from March 2020 to January 2022, Chapajong, while working as both a personal care aide and community support worker, fraudulently claimed to provide in-home personal care and behavioral health services to multiple clients in different locations at the same time. Additionally, Chapajong’s Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) data most often showed he was not in the vicinity of his client’s homes, where he purported to be providing services. In total, Medicaid paid $461,369 for Chapajong’s shifts with overlapping hours.

Michelle Shropshire, of Maryland, and Harlisha Jones, of Maryland and Washington, DC, both employed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) were charged by indictment with health care fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy charges for allegedly using Jones’s insurance policies with American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (AFLAC) to submit fraudulent health care and short-term disability insurance claims for injuries, medical treatments, and disability periods that did not exist. The indictment alleges that as part of the scheme defendants created fraudulent medical paperwork, including medical excuse notes and physician’s statements, and forged doctors’ signatures on those forms. Then, after AFLAC paid each claim to Jones, she paid a kickback to Shropshire using a portion of the claim proceeds. As a result of those fraudulent insurance claims, AFLAC paid Jones approximately $58,750, of which Jones paid approximately 20% back to Shropshire.

Similarly, in addition to Jones, Shropshire is alleged to have assisted a number of other WMATA employees with submitting fraudulent health care and short-term disability insurance claims to AFLAC, which paid at least $362,035 in benefits based upon the false claims. Of those other WMATA employees, the following have been charged by information and have pled guilty to charges involving the scheme and paying kickbacks to Shropshire: Sharon Washington of Virginia, and Selethia Blake, Brady Turner, Lushawn Foreman, and Margot Jackson, all of Maryland.

These cases, in particular, were investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office. The Shropshire case was also investigated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Office of Inspector General. U.S. v Chapajong was also investigated by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the D.C. Office of the Inspector General’s (DC-OIG) Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.

In addition to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, the Health Care Fraud Unit’s National Rapid Response, Florida, Gulf Coast, Los Angeles, Midwest, New England, Northeast, and Texas Strike Forces includes U.S. Attorneys Offices from around the nation; and State Attorney Generals’ Offices for Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are prosecuting the cases in the National Health Care Fraud Takedown, with assistance from the Health Care Fraud Unit’s Data Analytics Team. Descriptions of each case involved in today’s enforcement action are available on the Department of Justice website.

“If you don’t want to work, you’re the one who decided you don’t want health care,” he recently said on Fox News.
“The guilty plea includes one count relating to this upcoding practice,” the Justice Department wrote in a press release.
The company was also accused of billing Medicaid “for home health visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them or were not performed,” the department said.","Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who’s famous for his former hospital company’s record-setting Medicare fraud settlements, is currently leading an effort to make Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” even more painful for America’s poor.

The legislation already cuts $930 billion from Medicaid, the nation’s government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, and would eliminate coverage for millions. Scott’s amendment, expected to get a vote Monday, would take away another $313 billion in state Medicaid funds and force hundreds of thousands of additional people, at least, off the program.

Scott has framed his proposed Medicaid cuts as necessary to preserve the program “for those who truly need it” — and not “able-bodied” adults. “If you don’t want to work, you’re the one who decided you don’t want health care,” he recently said on Fox News. He’s suggested Democrats are using tax dollars to “give illegal aliens Medicaid benefits,” even though undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, claiming that blue states want to “exploit this safety net.”

Ironically enough, some of the claims against Scott’s old hospital company revolved around exploiting Medicaid, and billing for services that patients didn’t need.

Scott’s office did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment Monday.

The senator resigned as CEO of the hospital chain known as HCA Healthcare in 1997 amid an ongoing federal probe and a series of whistleblower complaints. He has long faced attacks from Democrats over the $1.7 billion that HCA paid to resolve fraud allegations in the early 2000s. Some of the allegations involved Medicaid.

In late 2000, as part of the “largest government fraud settlement ever” with the Justice Department, HCA pleaded guilty to criminal conduct and agreed to pay over $840 million in fines, penalties, and damages to resolve claims of unlawful billing practices.

Among the claims HCA settled over: The company was accused of billing “Medicare, Medicaid, the Defense Department’s TRICARE health care program, and the Federal Employees’ Health Benefits Program, for lab tests that were not medically necessary” and “not ordered by physicians.”

HCA was accused of “upcoding,” or pretending patients were sicker than they were in order to increase reimbursements to its hospitals. “The guilty plea includes one count relating to this upcoding practice,” the Justice Department wrote in a press release. The company was also accused of billing Medicaid “for home health visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them or were not performed,” the department said.

The civil and administrative settlement agreement between HCA and the U.S. Justice Department said the company, from 1995 to 1998, submitted claims to Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE, “(a) for visits to patients who did not qualify for home health services because (i) the patients were not homebound, (ii) there was no medical need for such services, or (iii) there was no medical need for skilled services; (b) for visits that were not provided; (c) for visits to deliver services that were in fact or should have been provided by an assisted living facility.”

HCA and the Justice Department entered into an additional settlement agreement in 2003, in which the company agreed to pay another $631 million to resolve false claims it submitted to federal health programs.

In a civil settlement agreement, the Justice Department wrote that health regulators “contend that they have certain administrative claims against HCA under the provisions for permissive exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs.”

Under both agreements, the Justice Department announced that HCA would pay millions of dollars to state Medicaid agencies: $13.6 million in 2000, and then $17.5 million in 2003. The department said the latter figure represented “direct state losses.”

A few decades later, Scott is now trying to extract a huge amount of money from state Medicaid funds to help finance Trump’s latest round of tax cuts for the rich.

Some things never really change.

Over the past decade, the number of veterans has declined, but the percent of veterans with Medicaid has increased.
Forty-one states, including DC, have adopted Medicaid expansion, and nearly seven in ten (69%) veterans ages 19 and older who have Medicaid coverage live in a state that has expanded Medicaid.
In 2023, 11% of veterans in Medicaid expansion states were enrolled in Medicaid, compared to 9% in non-expansion states.","The One Big Beautiful Bill passed by the House is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over the next 10 years, a cut that could lead to 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in Medicaid in 2034.

Medicaid currently provides health care coverage to 1 in 10 veterans (1.6 million people), and for some, it is their only source of coverage, especially if they do not qualify for military health benefits such as care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA health care), or TRICARE, the health insurance program administered by the Department of Defense for eligible active-duty service members, retirees, and their families.

The Department of Veterans Affairs operates a nationwide health care system, but access is not guaranteed. Eligibility for VA health care depends on a veteran’s service history, discharge status, income, and whether a health condition is connected to their military service. As a result, about half of veterans are enrolled in VA health care. TRICARE, meanwhile, is generally limited to active-duty members and military retirees.

Medicaid helps fill gaps in coverage for veterans who are low-income, have disabilities, or are otherwise ineligible for military health benefits. Many veterans use Medicaid alongside Medicare or VA health care, particularly as they age and their health needs increase. Veterans enrolled in Medicaid have complex health conditions, including high rates of disability, mental illness, and substance use disorders. Medicaid ensures regular access to care for these veterans, helping them manage chronic conditions, access a broader range of providers outside the VA system, and pay for services not covered by VA health care, such as different forms of long-term care. It also reduces out-of-pocket costs that can pose a barrier to care. This brief presents key facts about veterans enrolled in Medicaid and examines how proposed changes could affect their coverage and access to care.

1. Over the past decade, the number of veterans has declined, but the percent of veterans with Medicaid has increased.

In 2023, there were approximately 16 million veterans ages 19 and older in the United States. The veteran population is both aging and shrinking: nearly half of all veterans are 65 and older, and the total number has declined by 7 million over the past decade, from 23 million in 2013, as older veterans from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War have passed away, and fewer individuals have entered military service in the recent years.

As the veteran population changes, so too have the pathways to coverage. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) created a new pathway to coverage for veterans who might otherwise have been uninsured by expanding Medicaid eligibility to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Medicaid expansion covers adults who are parents of dependent children whose income is above the eligibility limit for parent coverage and adults who do not have dependent children and who were previously not eligible for Medicaid. Forty-one states, including DC, have adopted Medicaid expansion, and nearly seven in ten (69%) veterans ages 19 and older who have Medicaid coverage live in a state that has expanded Medicaid.

Since the implementation of Medicaid expansion, the share of veterans with Medicaid, either as their sole source of coverage or in combination with other insurances, has increased, and the share of those who are uninsured has dropped. Between 2013 and 2023, Medicaid enrollment among all veterans increased from 8% to 10% (Figure 1), representing 1.6 million veterans in 2023. However, the share of veterans enrolled in Medicaid varies across states, ranging from as low as 6% to as high as 15% (Appendix Table ). In 2023, 11% of veterans in Medicaid expansion states were enrolled in Medicaid, compared to 9% in non-expansion states. Over the 2013-2023 period, the uninsured rate for veterans fell by more than half, dropping to 2% from 6% (Figure 1). Studies link Medicaid expansion to increased coverage, improved access to care, greater healthcare affordability, and better health .

2. Medicaid often supplements coverage for an aging veteran population.

Among those 1.6 million veterans with Medicaid coverage, most had additional forms of insurance. While some rely on Medicaid as their only source of coverage, it more often supplements other types of insurance by covering services that other payers may not, such as long-term care. For veterans who are also enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid can help cover both premiums and cost-sharing responsibilities, reducing out-of-pocket costs for services like doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs.

Only 17% of veterans with Medicaid were covered by Medicaid alone. The remaining 83% had at least one other source of coverage. The most common combination was Medicaid and Medicare, which accounted for 60% of all veterans with Medicaid (some of whom were also enrolled in VA health care). This high share reflects the aging veteran population; half of all veterans with Medicaid were 65 and older. Many of today’s veterans served during the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. Smaller percentages of veterans were also enrolled in VA health care (17%), or another other form of insurance coverage, such as TRICARE or employer-sponsored insurance (6%).

3. Veterans with Medicaid have higher disability rates than those who are not covered by Medicaid.

Nearly half (49%) of veterans covered by Medicaid, either as their only source of coverage or in combination with other insurance, report having a disability, compared to fewer than three in ten (29%) veterans who are not covered by Medicaid (Figure 3). A person is considered to have a disability if they experience difficulty with hearing, vision, cognitive function, mobility, self-care, or independent living. While disability rates increase with age among all veterans, the difference in the rates between those with Medicaid and those not covered by Medicaid are especially pronounced in their working-age years. Among veterans ages 27 to 49, 33% of those with Medicaid reported a disability, compared to 17% of those with other coverage. The gap is even wider among veterans ages 50 to 64, with 51% of Medicaid enrollees reporting having a disability compared to 20% of those with other coverage. Veterans 65 and older have the highest disability rates of any age group, but even among this group, a higher percentage of veterans with Medicaid have a disability (55%) compared to those without (40%).

4. Medicaid supports regular access to care for veterans who have high rates of chronic conditions.

Veterans covered by Medicaid often have complex health needs. Nearly half (45%) of veterans with Medicaid describe their health as fair or poor, more than twice the share among those not covered by Medicaid (18%) (Figure 4). All veterans have high rates of chronic conditions (82% for those with Medicaid and 79% for those without), but some conditions are more common among veterans with Medicaid. Specifically, behavioral health conditions affect a larger share of veterans with Medicaid, with 46% reporting any form of mental illness and 26% reporting substance use disorder (SUD), compared to 17% and 13%, respectively, among those without Medicaid. Medicaid provides access to care, including mental health and SUD care for veterans. Among veterans covered by Medicaid, 41% received mental health or SUD treatment in the past year, nearly twice the share of those without Medicaid (21%).

5. Nearly seven in ten working-age veterans with Medicaid are working, but work varies by age, disability, and parental status.

Nearly seven in ten (68%) working-age veterans (ages 19 to 64) enrolled in Medicaid are working, excluding those who receive Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance, or are dually enrolled in Medicare (Figure 5). The share of veterans in this age group varies by state (Appendix Table 2). Veterans who are older (ages 50 to 64), have a disability, or do not have dependent children are less likely to be working:

The share of veterans who are working declines with age: 79% of those ages 19 to 26 are working, compared to 59% of those ages 50 to 64.

While 75% of veterans without a disability are working, that share drops to 51% among those with a disability.

Parents are more likely to be in the workforce than veterans without dependent children (78% vs 60%), likely reflecting their relatively younger age and lower rates of disability.

Proposed changes to Medicaid that would impose work and reporting requirements as a condition of eligibility could negatively affect veterans and lead to coverage loss among those who are unable to work or those unable to report or document work or exemption criteria.

Crystal Saraceni was honored with the 2025 award for Healthy Work Environment, a recognition reserved for those who define excellence in military nursing.

The award included civilians and nurses from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, distinguishing Saraceni from more than 29,000 nurses within the Military Health System.

Saraceni, a member of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay, transformed geographic isolation into innovation, crafting a resilient, mission-ready nursing culture at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay.

Cmdr. Rebeca Rodriguez, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, nominated Saraceni for the award. “We often focus so hard on ensuring deckplate sailors are recognized for their accomplishments that we forget that leadership is at the deckplate as well,” Rodriguez said. “Seeing the hard work and determination that she puts into everything she does makes me so proud. I wanted everyone to be aware of her passion and incredible work ethic.”

The Healthy Work Environment Award recognizes Saraceni for her impact creating a better workplace environment and inspiring nurses and corpsmen to continuously improve and excel. “Leadership is about establishing trust and building a solid team,” Saraceni said. “I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to participate in this journey.”

As Clinical Nurse Specialist, Director of Clinical Support Services, and Chief Nursing Informatics Officer, Saraceni tackled challenges related to the hospital’s low-patient volume. Recognizing the risk of skill atrophy, she introduced hands-on training to maintain clinical readiness, covering procedures like anticoagulant injections and nasogastric tube care.

Her efforts enhanced clinical competencies and fostered a culture of continuous learning and patient safety. “I was shocked to get news of being selected for this award; it is humbling to receive this recognition,” Saraceni said. “To me, it’s a matter of doing my job. I come to work, do my best and hope that the lessons we learn together establish a groundwork for success in my teammates’ future careers. In my position, a huge part of my responsibility is to train and support our nursing and corps staff.”

Chief Hospital Corpsman LeMichael Wright, senior enlisted leader for Clinical Support Services, was one of several sailors who provided feedback to support Saraceni’s nomination. Wright praised her leadership and commitment to professional development. “Commander Saraceni is a dedicated and exceptional leader who balances mission success with the well-being of her team,” Wright said. “She consistently recognizes her staff's achievements and goes above and beyond to ensure the morale and functionality of her departments, even during critical manpower shortages. Her leadership was crucial during Operation Southern Guard, where she selflessly shifted roles to support the mission, prioritizing the needs of others over her own. Her commitment to her personnel and the mission exemplifies a leadership style that is truly unparalleled.”

Under her leadership, departments earned three of the last four Department of the Quarter awards. She also supported staff morale through activities like the Captain’s Cup, promoting camaraderie and self-care. “She’s a strong advocate for all personnel on the island,” said Capt. Tammy Servies, hospital director and commanding officer of USNMRTC Guantanamo Bay. “Our unique location and patient population require constant advocacy, and I can always count on her to fight for our patients. “This recognition is a long time coming,” Servies continued. “She is truly an expert in many fields and her push to cross-train our nurses in this remote location demonstrates her forward-leaning strategic thinking.”

Capt. Bond Henry, chief nursing officer for Defense Health Network Atlantic, coordinated award nominations across the region. “We selected one nomination from each category to move forward from our Network, fine-tuned the nominations, and submitted to be considered across the entire DHA,” said Henry. “Commander Saraceni was highlighted as a leader who has thrived in a small and isolated environment, which requires top performers to fill multiple roles at once. Her leadership style and proactive approach to problem solving created a healthy work environment for all the staff in Guantanamo Bay.”

The Defense Health Agency manages military treatment facilities across the Department of Defense, integrating healthcare services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations. As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role as the only hospital delivering healthcare to service members and their families, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors, stationed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The hospital also operates the Department of Defense’s only overseas military home healthcare program, providing ongoing care to elderly special category residents who sought asylum on the installation during the Cuban Revolution.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9136559.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-30 15:56:20.711452

Deputy Commissioner for Operations & Chief Operating Officer, Food and Drug Administration

Barclay Butler’s latest achievement is applying the lessons he learned while leading the consolidation of Army, Navy and Air Force hospitals into the Defense Health Agency to designing and launching FDA’s new shared services operating model.

“Our single vision in the COO’s office is to remove administrative burdens from the reviewers, inspectors, and investigators by providing them with effective and efficient shared services covering finance, human resources, facilities, IT, contracting, grants, FOIA, and more, by which we can improve on the time and cost of reviews and inspections, bring more products to the American public, while assuring we meet the FDA mission to protect the public health and preserve the national security,” Butler said.

Why Watch

Through 2025, Butler’s team will focus on building and training the shared service providers that support FDA centers, offices and programs. Their goal is to remove administrative burdens from the drug, biologics, medical device, tobacco and food review teams; ensure a safe food supply; keep inspectors and investigators in the field; and give FDA staff more time to carry out their mission of protecting public health and national security.

As one of the largest operational divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services, FDA is fully aligned with the efficient use of taxpayer-funded resources. It has exceeded the administration’s resourcing goals while continuing to fulfill its critical mission on behalf of the American public.

“We also have to modernize,” said Dr. Marty Makary, FDA commissioner. “On day one of me being on the job, I actively began an effort to organize to use AI for our scientific reviewers to make their jobs easier. Well, two weeks ago, we just announced our first AI-assisted review with the latest generation AI technology. One reviewer said that what normally took him two to three days, the AI did in six minutes. … The goal is to reduce the paperwork burden of reviewers, which is tremendous, so that we can deliver more cures and meaningful treatments to the American people faster.”

Fun Fact: Butler is an avid sailor who spends his vacations chartering bareboats along the U.S. East Coast and in the British Virgin Islands. He’s also a member of American Legion Riders, riding his Harley-Davidson in parades with three large flags mounted on the back and helping raise money for local charities.",https://washingtonexec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-27-at-8.06.01 AM.png,N,0.0,2025-06-29 13:56:24.121607

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services.
We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.
These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy.","When I was Governor, we focused on providing great services to Nebraskans. The federal government should do the same. Now that I’m in the Senate, my team and I are here to help Nebraskans navigate the bureaucracy.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/16/2024/06/Senator-Pete-Ricketts.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-29 13:56:44.332989

I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.
In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services.
We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.
These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy.","When I was Governor, we focused on providing great services to Nebraskans. The federal government should do the same. Now that I’m in the Senate, my team and I are here to help Nebraskans navigate the bureaucracy.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/16/2024/06/Senator-Pete-Ricketts.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-28 22:56:38.772131
