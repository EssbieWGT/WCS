By Gizem Nisa Demir

ISTANBUL (AA) - Eighty-one women have now joined a civil lawsuit in Texas accusing a US Army gynecologist at Fort Hood of sexual misconduct during medical exams, as the army faces growing scrutiny over patient safety and internal oversight.

Newsmax reported Friday that the expanded complaint, filed in Bell County, alleges Maj. Blaine McGraw covertly recorded patients, engaged in inappropriate touching, and conducted intrusive, unnecessary exams while serving at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.

The civil case runs alongside an ongoing criminal prosecution, in which army prosecutors have charged McGraw with more than 50 specifications of “indecent visual recording” involving dozens of alleged victims, according to army officials.

- Monitoring case 'very closely'

Army leadership has acknowledged the gravity of the allegations. Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre recently visited the Fort Hood facility to review Defense Health Agency policies.

“Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,” Obadal said.

“I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and army readiness.”

A US official, speaking anonymously, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the case “very, very closely” and ordered a fact-finding mission to assess conditions “on the ground.”

“It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the army and the military try to uphold,” the official added.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement at the Bell County Jail since early December. Army officials say he was removed from patient care in October, within hours of the first complaint. Defense attorneys have not publicly responded to the expanded lawsuit.

Defense lawyers have not publicly responded to the expanded complaint.","A total of 81 women have filed a civil lawsuit in Texas against U.S. Army Major Blaine McGraw, a gynecologist who faces criminal charges for allegedly surreptitiously recording patients at Fort Hood, prompting official responses from Army leadership concerning patient safety and the evaluation of Army policies.

A civil lawsuit against Army Maj. Blaine McGraw expanded this week when the women added claims accusing the gynecologist of inappropriate touching, covert filming, and other alleged misconduct during medical exams.

The development is the latest in a case already under criminal prosecution and now prompting official Army leadership statements.

McGraw, a medical officer at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, was charged by the Army’s Office of Special Trial Counsel with more than 50 specifications of ""indecent visual recording"" and related offenses involving dozens of victims, according to Army officials.

The expanded civil complaint, filed in Bell County, Texas, alleges McGraw violated state assault, sexual assault, and battery laws and harmed patients through intrusive and unnecessary exams.

Plaintiffs say McGraw took advantage of his position of trust to record intimate procedures secretly.

In published statements, Army leaders acknowledged the seriousness of the allegations and outlined steps being taken to review policies and protect patients.

Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre visited the medical center to review Defense Health Agency policies.

""Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,"" Obadal said.

""I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and Army readiness.""

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity about internal Army leadership discussions, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the situation ""very, very closely"" and dispatched the team at Fort Hood as a fact-finding mission to understand the situation ""on the ground.""

""It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the Army and the military try to uphold,"" the official said.

The civil complaint also contends that McGraw ""failed to document in her medical records that a rape kit had ever been performed,"" which the plaintiff’s lawyers argued interfered with subsequent criminal prosecution of an alleged assailant.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement in Bell County Jail since early December.

Army officials say he was suspended from patient care in October after the first allegations surfaced and that investigators began reviewing his conduct within hours of the initial complaint.

Attorneys for the women filed the expanded civil complaint shortly after the government announced criminal charges.

The lawsuit includes alleged victims from Texas and other states, reflecting a broader pattern of claims spanning McGraw’s Army career.

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997.
“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt.
“His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said.
“I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”","Dr. Mark Rubertone, chief of functional information technology support for Defense Health Agency’s Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division within DHA-Public Health, received the Department of War’s Distinguished Civilian Service Award during a ceremony Dec. 3, 2025, at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.

“I'm deeply grateful and humbled by this recognition,” said Rubertone. “Receiving this award is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the entire team I've had the privilege to lead and work alongside. It means a great deal to me — not just as an individual achievement — but as validation of the importance of public health data and health IT in supporting our nation's warfighters.”

The award is DOW’s highest recognition for career civilian employees whose work improves the efficiency and impact of the entire department.

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997. This system is critical to execute comprehensive health surveillance on our military family.”

Rubertone said the award is “truly a reflection of the incredible team I've been fortunate to work with throughout my career and in particular during the past 10 years at DHA. The success we've achieved is entirely attributable to their expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment to our mission.”

Modernizing health data for readiness

As functional IT support chief, Rubertone led teams to upgrade tools used for tracking the burden of disease, injury, and illness among beneficiaries across the Military Health System.

Those systems helped public health experts study trends ranging from musculoskeletal injuries to COVID-19 and measure the effectiveness of prevention and treatment efforts. The data collected was vital for leaders in Congress, the Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services to set policy and allocate services.

“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of AFHSD. “The impact of these tools on warfighter readiness comes from how they are used to track, interpret, validate, and communicate essential health threats that directly affect the force.”

Rubertone underscored his commitment to warfighter lethality, stating, “My work, at its core, is about ensuring our warfighters are healthy, protected, and ready to answer the call of duty. We accomplish this by providing data and tools necessary to identify threats to their health, track injury and illness trends, and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures.”

Air Force Col. Cecilia Session, chief of AFHSD’s epidemiology and analysis branch, highlighted Rubertone’s ability at translating complex data into clear, reliable information for commanders and policymakers. “His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said. “As the DHA’s systems evolve to incorporate advances in information technology, he is the vanguard of modernizing and integrating our health data systems.”

Rubertone also played a key role in bringing data from MHS GENESIS into DOW's surveillance systems as the electronic health record rolled out between 2017 and 2024. That work helped link information from clinics and hospitals around the world to long-standing tools such as the Defense Medical Surveillance System and the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

In creating these tools, “his visionary ideas have been a cornerstone of force health protections and readiness,” said Dr. Shauna Stahlman, deputy chief of epidemiology and analysis at AFHSD. “His leadership shows that when we preserve the past with purpose, we equip the future with possibility.”

Data-driven service provides ‘meaningful change’ for readiness

The Distinguished Civilian Service Awards are reserved each year for a small number of career civilians whose work has a department-wide impact.

The award honors a career that has shown how advanced health surveillance and secure, integrated data systems serve what DHA calls “medicine for the mission” — protecting the force, promoting health, and ensuring the military remains ready to respond.

Data, Rubertone said, “has the power to drive meaningful change, especially when it comes to public health and national security.”

At the cornerstone of his renowned career, Rubertone emphasized, is his dedication in using this data to help the warfighter. “There's a constant challenge to innovate, to adapt to evolving threats, and to find new ways to use data to improve the health and readiness of our warfighters,” he said. “I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9438883.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-13 00:56:32.266507

Our priority is to ensure that all patients receive the safe, high-quality care they deserve in our facilities. To that end, we are conducting thorough internal reviews to ensure accountability and strengthen systemic safeguards. This includes reviewing clinical protocols, supervision mechanisms—such as the use of chaperones—and reporting and complaint procedures across the enterprise. Our goal is to maintain safe and secure environments for both our beneficiaries and personnel.”

Representatives John Carter and August Pfluger, along with Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, sent a letter Wednesday to Lieutenant General Gregory D. Brady, the Army's Inspector General, requesting immediate action regarding Maj. Blaine McGraw, a suspended OB-GYN who worked at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.

The lawmakers described the allegations as ""deeply disturbing"" and said they, ""raise profound concerns about clinical oversight, command accountability, and the integrity of the military health system.""

""These accusations do not reflect isolated lapses; they point to potential long-term failures,"" the letter states.

“The Army and Department of War Inspector Generals must conduct an investigation into the systemic failures that allowed Major Blaine McGraw to continue in his capacity amidst multiple accusations of egregious sexual misconduct,” said Sen. Cornyn. “The allegations made against Major McGraw and how they were mishandled warrant a thorough investigation, and I implore the Army and the Department to promptly look into this matter, bring justice to his countless victims, and work to prevent another failing in the future.”

- Sen. John Cornyn

The congressional delegation is requesting an independent investigation that extends beyond a routine internal inquiry, given that the alleged conduct may have occurred over an extended period across multiple duty stations.

The lawmakers are asking the Department of the Army Office of Inspector General to examine how clinical, command, and Defense Health Agency oversight structures failed to identify and intervene in this case.

""A transparent assessment of systemic shortcomings, and actionable recommendations to strengthen standards of care and accountability will be essential to restoring trust within the military community,"" they wrote.

The letter includes seven specific questions for the Army, including requests for:

A comprehensive investigation into all allegations involving Major McGraw

Trauma-informed resources and victim assistance programs for former patients and families

Notification of the Texas Medical Board and other state licensing authorities

Identification of systemic oversight failures

Review of Defense Health Agency Graduate Medical Education program oversight

Assessment of medical supervisors who worked with Major McGraw

Evaluation of reporting pathways for patients experiencing misconduct

The lawmakers emphasized that military health system patients ""deserve confidence that their care is provided in an environment that prioritizes safety, accountability, and professionalism.""

The letter requests that the Inspector General keep Congress informed of the Department's findings and next steps in addressing the allegations.

The House passed the FY2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in a 312-112 vote; 94 Democrats and 18 Republicans opposed the bill.

The NDAA includes a 3.8% pay raise for U.S. troops, blocks the Pentagon from reducing the number of U.S. troops “permanently stationed in or deployed to” Europe below 76,000 for longer than 45 days, and authorizes $400 million in annual security assistance for Ukraine, The New York Times reports.

According to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, the bill codifies all or parts of 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, including:

Restoring America’s Fighting Force

Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs

Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border

Securing Our Borders

Clarifying the Military’s Role in Defending U.S. Territorial Integrity

Modernizing Defense Acquisitions & Spurring Innovation

Building the Golden Dome for America

Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security

Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty

Unleashing American Drone Dominance

The speaker’s office also highlighted multiple “major conservative victories” the bill delivers, including:

Ends wokeness and DEI by eliminating programs, offices, and training across the Department of War (DOW).

Secures the border by expanding DOW support for Department of Homeland Security operations, National Guard deployments and National Defense Areas.

Revitalizes the defense industrial base: Grows U.S. defense manufacturing jobs, onshore critical supply chains, and expands surge capacity.

Ensures allies pay their fair share: Adds new tools to push allies to shoulder more of their own defense costs.

House Democrats had pushed for the inclusion of a provision covering the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) for service members and their families.

Thankfully, Speaker Johnson “intervened during final negotiations to kill that provision,” the Times reports, over concerns it would lead to the destruction of many embryos.

Speaker Johnson is entirely correct. The provision he killed would have used taxpayer money to subsidize an industry that routinely creates and discards hundreds of thousands of tiny human lives each year.

In fact, the baby-making industry (fertility clinics) destroys more human lives every year than the baby-taking (abortion) industry.

Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy for Students for Life of America, applauded the speaker’s intervention.

“IVF is not an industry that deserves blanket support and funding. We can do better,” she said in a statement.

Lila Rose, president of Live Action, also thanked Speaker Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

The House’s original version of the NDAA contained additional conservative priorities, “including a ban on the Pentagon covering [transgender] surgeries for troops. But that provision and several others were stripped out in final negotiations,” the Times notes.

Though the provision doesn’t appear in the NDAA, the Pentagon stopped fund transgender medical interventions for U.S. soldiers earlier this year after President Trump signed an executive order prohibiting transgenderism within the military.

The NDAA still includes a prohibition on biological males participating in women’s sports at U.S. military academies.

The Senate is expected to overwhelmingly approve the legislation, with President Trump signing it into law before the end of the year.

John Carter is leading a bipartisan group of lawmakers calling for an Inspector General investigation into what they describe as systemic failures in the Army’s handling of allegations against Maj. Blaine McGraw, a former Army physician accused of repeated misconduct toward service members and their families.

Carter, co-chair of the House Army Caucus and a former judge, joined Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Rep. August Pfluger in sending a letter urging the Army Inspector General to conduct an independent, comprehensive review of the case.

“As a former judge and co-chair of the House Army Caucus, I find the allegations against Major McGraw to be an egregious breach of the trust placed in him, and the oversight failures that allowed him to continue practicing are equally alarming,” Carter said in a statement. He said the Army must determine how McGraw “was able to continue victimizing Soldiers and their families” and ensure steps are taken to prevent similar failures.

Cornyn echoed those concerns, saying the Army and the Department of War Inspector Generals “must conduct an investigation into the systemic failures that allowed Major Blaine McGraw to continue in his capacity amidst multiple accusations of egregious sexual misconduct.” He said the allegations and their alleged mishandling “warrant a thorough investigation” to bring justice to victims and prevent future lapses.

In their letter to Lieutenant General Telita Crosland Brady, the lawmakers said the accusations against McGraw raise serious questions about clinical oversight, command accountability and the integrity of the military health system. Because the alleged misconduct may stretch across multiple duty stations and time periods, they urged the Department of War to launch a review that goes beyond a “routine internal inquiry.”

The letter calls for an independent investigation into both McGraw’s actions and the Army’s prior response to complaints or warnings. Lawmakers also asked the Inspector General to examine potential breakdowns in clinical supervision, the Defense Health Agency’s oversight structure and reporting pathways for medical misconduct.

To ensure transparency, the lawmakers submitted a series of questions seeking clarity on how the Army intends to investigate previous complaints, what resources will be made available to victims, and whether state medical licensing boards have been notified. They also requested evaluations of graduate medical education supervision standards and the conduct of supervisors who worked with McGraw.

“The men and women served by the military health system deserve confidence that their care is provided in an environment that prioritizes safety, accountability and professionalism,” the letter states.

McGraw faces allegations involving more than 100 individuals across multiple states for secretly recording patients during their exams. The claims involve patients from Fort Hood, Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

""These reports are deeply concerning and indescribably horrific. I and my staff are in contact with the Army and monitoring their investigation. I'm committed to ensuring a full accounting of the facts and that justice is served,” said Sen. Ted Cruz in a statement.

If you have been waiting patiently for the official word on your 2026 paycheck, you can finally stop refreshing the Reddit feed. The numbers are in, and for the vast majority of the force, the news is pretty good, if less exciting than the last two years. As of early December 2025, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference report has confirmed a 3.8% pay raise for active duty and reserve troops. It does track with civilian wage growth, even if it does not quite match the historic highs of the past three years.

But if you look past the headline percentage, the 2026 financial landscape is a different entity entirely. From a potential overhaul of junior enlisted pay to a TRICARE price hike that is quietly John Wick’ing your wallet, here is the no-nonsense breakdown of what is hitting your bank account next year.

The Base Pay: 3.8% (The “Standard Issue Raise”)

Let’s start with the confirmed target. Effective January 1, 2026, base pay will increase by 3.8% across the board. This number is locked in the final conference version of the defense bill announced on Dec. 7, 2025. Is it the 5.2% we saw back in 2024? No. But considering the historical average usually hovers closer to 2.5%, a 3.8% hike is designed to keep military purchasing power competitive with the private sector.

What does this mean for an E-5 with six years of service? It will translate to roughly an extra $134 per month before taxes. It won’t buy you a new Mustang (Hey! Please do not finance a Mustang at 30% APR), but it will help offset the price of beef.

The Wild Card: The Junior Enlisted “Stimulus”

Here is where the briefing gets interesting. While the 3.8% is locked and loaded, Congress, much like the late Steve Irwin, is currently wrastling with a much bigger animal: a targeted pay restructuring for grades E-1 through E-4, crikey. The House and Senate have both pushed for a targeted boost that could raise the total pay for junior troops by up to 15%, helping relieve the need for junior families to use food stamps to survive.

Before you PFCs start ordering bottle service at the club, understand that this is still in the “fog of war” phase. While the intent is there in the drafts, implementation is always the enemy. There is a strong chance this could be a “split raise,” where the standard 3.8% hits in January, and the targeted bonus (“the rest of the 15%”) doesn’t kick in until later in the fiscal year. Watch your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) closely. Until you see that code on the printout, treat that extra cash as rumor, not as a resource.

Retirees & VA: The 2.8% COLA

For our veterans who have already hung up the uniform, the news is steady as she goes. The Social Security Administration confirmed a 2.8% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) effective Dec. 1, 2025. In case you are wondering, Soc Sec COLA applies to military pensions and VA disability compensation as well.

If you are rated at 100% disability (veteran only), your monthly payment is going from roughly $3,877 to almost $3,986. It is welcome, but let’s be honest: after the inflation we’ve had shoved down our throats since 2021, that extra money feels more like a band-aid on a bullet hole.

The Schoolhouse Rock (GI Bill, VR&E, & Chapter 35)

Now, if you are currently trading your uniforms and PT formation for a hoodie and sitting in a classroom, listen up. The education benefits do not follow the standard January 1st COLA timeline. The VA and DoD love to make things complicated, so here is the breakdown of what your stipend looks like as of Dec. 9, 2025.

First, address the most common misconception we see in the comment sections and emails: Your Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) Monthly Housing Allowance does NOT go up on January 1. Even though the active duty BAH rates change in January, the VA does not update the MHA rates for students until August 1, 2026, the start of the new academic year. You are locked into the 2025-2026 academic year rates until next summer. Currently, the private school cap sits at roughly $29,920 per year, and online-only students are capped at $1,169 per month, which is half the national average.

However, if you are using VR&E (Chapter 31), your subsistence rates actually bumped up back on Oct. 1, 2025. If you haven’t checked the new pay scales, please be careful. As of Oct. 1, the full-time rate for a veteran with no dependents is $812.84 per month. If you have two dependents, that jumps to $1,188.15. Remember, if you are eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you can usually elect to get paid the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 BAH Rate (based on the zipcode of the school you attend) instead of these subsistence numbers, which is almost always more money.

For the spouses and kids using Chapter 35 (DEA), your rates also shifted at the start of the fiscal year on October 1. The full-time student rate is $1,574.00 per month. If you are going three-quarters time, that drops to $1,244.00. Finally, for the few of you still rocking the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30), maybe you bought in for that $1,200 fee back in boot camp; your rates are effectively $2,518.00 a month for full-time enrollment as of Oct. 1, 2025.

Side note: The Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of Rudisill v. McDonough (April 2024), whoever paid their $1200 for Montgomery GI Bill and then forfeited it in order to obtain Post 9/11 benefits was not required to, and that it was illegal. Therefore, those affected will have time added to their educational benefits.

TRICARE and Housing

You didn’t think you were getting a raise without also getting a headache, did you? The 2026 updates come with a few roadbumps. The cost of convenience is going up at the pharmacy. If you use TRICARE Home Delivery for brand-name drugs, your copay is jumping from $38 to $44 for a 90-day supply. It is a subtle increase, but like a pebble in your shoe, you will feel it over time.

Then there is the housing situation, which finally got some much-needed clarity today. The Department of Defense released the 2026 Basic Allowance for Housing rates on December 11, 2025, confirming an average increase of 4.2% across the force. While the Pentagon is planning to deal out approximately $29.9 billion in housing allowances next year, you should probably hold off on browsing Zillow for an upgrade. That average increase varies widely by zip code; what this means is that troops in high-cost blast zones like San Diego or Norfolk might see a significant increase to match local rents, while others might see the needle barely move.

A raise is only good if the numbers check out. Do not wait until mid-January to find out if DFAS got it right. Check your MyPay account around December 19-20. That is usually when the “January 1” preview LES loads into the system. Always verify and constant vigilance; routinely go over your base pay for the month, check your tax withholdings, and for the love of all that is holy, make sure your allotments are still correct and updated. 2026 is bringing more money to the pipeline, but as always, it is on you to manage the logistics… please don’t pay 30% interest on that Mustang!

In short, this expert panel has corroborated what autism advocates and military families have known for years.","Raising a child with autism can be challenging under the best of circumstances. But for military families, that labor of love can be even more difficult.

More than 20,000 children of active-duty military service members have been diagnosed with autism. Yet for years, the health plan for these families, TRICARE, has refused to cover one of the most effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder as a basic benefit — a therapy known as applied behavior analysis, or ABA.

Families and clinicians have long been mystified, even outraged, by the military's stance on this issue. Last month, the prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine joined their ranks.

In a new 310-page report, the National Academies concluded that ABA is a medically necessary therapy that should be offered to all children of military members who need it. The report went so far as to say, ""Scientific evidence indicates that ABA is an appropriate intervention to support health outcomes for autistic individuals.""

It's time for the Department of Defense to acknowledge this obvious truth and give military families the essential medical support they deserve.

ABA uses scientifically based insights and techniques to promote positive behavior — and discourage problematic behavior — in children with autism. The medical and scientific communities have acknowledged its benefits for years.

A recent review of the scientific literature in the journal Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders concluded that ""ABA programs are moderately to highly effective bringing significant benefits for children with ASD.""

As far back as 1999, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recognized ABA as the gold standard in autism care.

The Department of Defense, however, has been unconvinced. It was only in 2014 that TRICARE began offering ABA to families as part of a ""demonstration program"" aimed at studying the therapy's effectiveness.

That demonstration is still up and running — and currently provides about 16,000 military families with ABA services.

Yet more than a decade after the program launched, the Department of Defense continues to insist that ABA falls short of the evidence standards required for coverage under TRICARE.

This claim flies in the face of years of established scientific research — and now the new report from the National Academies.

Nearly four years ago, Congress tasked the independent committee of experts behind the new study with evaluating TRICARE's ABA demonstration. They concluded that ""ABA fits DOD’s Criteria for Reliable Evidence of Proven Medical Effectiveness.""

The report goes on to recommend, in no uncertain terms, that ""The Defense Health Agency should discontinue the Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration (ACD) and authorize coverage of applied behavior analysis (ABA) as a Basic benefit under the TRICARE program.""

But it doesn't stop there. The committee also finds that the DOD's demonstration program has needlessly obstructed access to ABA for military families. And it implores the Defense Health Agency to ""take steps to ensure that administrative processes do not impede access to care.""

In short, this expert panel has corroborated what autism advocates and military families have known for years. The DOD has deliberately restricted access to medically necessary care for military-connected children. And it has inflicted enormous harm on service members and their families in doing so.

Active-duty armed services members sacrifice every day for the safety and security of our nation. Denying necessary medical care to these Americans — as well as to their children — is shameful.

It shouldn't have taken an expert report to point out this fact. But now that the NASEM has made plain the military's negligence, the Department of Defense should waste little time in correcting its mistake — and making ABA a basic health benefit for active-duty military families.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/59/359214c1-9395-49e1-ad95-e2e92d608c3f/692761879aecc.image.jpg?crop=799%2C420%2C0%2C80,N,0.0,2025-12-12 12:56:34.376327

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997.
“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt.
“His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said.

It means a great deal to me — not just as an individual achievement — but as validation of the importance of public health data and health IT in supporting our nation's warfighters.” The award is DOW’s highest recognition for career civilian employees whose work improves the efficiency and impact of the entire department. Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997. This system is critical to execute comprehensive health surveillance on our military family.” Rubertone said the award is “truly a reflection of the incredible team I've been fortunate to work with throughout my career and in particular during the past 10 years at DHA. The success we've achieved is entirely attributable to their expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment to our mission.” Modernizing health data for readiness As functional IT support chief, Rubertone led teams to upgrade tools used for tracking the burden of disease, injury, and illness among beneficiaries across the Military Health System. Those systems helped public health experts study trends ranging from musculoskeletal injuries to COVID-19 and measure the effectiveness of prevention and treatment efforts. The data collected was vital for leaders in Congress, the Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services to set policy and allocate services. “Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of AFHSD. “The impact of these tools on warfighter readiness comes from how they are used to track, interpret, validate, and communicate essential health threats that directly affect the force.” Rubertone underscored his commitment to warfighter lethality, stating, “My work, at its core, is about ensuring our warfighters are healthy, protected, and ready to answer the call of duty. We accomplish this by providing data and tools necessary to identify threats to their health, track injury and illness trends, and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures.” Air Force Col. Cecilia Session, chief of AFHSD’s epidemiology and analysis branch, highlighted Rubertone’s ability at translating complex data into clear, reliable information for commanders and policymakers. “His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said. “As the DHA’s systems evolve to incorporate advances in information technology, he is the vanguard of modernizing and integrating our health data systems.” Rubertone also played a key role in bringing data from MHS GENESIS into DOW's surveillance systems as the electronic health record rolled out between 2017 and 2024. That work helped link information from clinics and hospitals around the world to long-standing tools such as the Defense Medical Surveillance System and the Department of Defense Serum Repository. In creating these tools, “his visionary ideas have been a cornerstone of force health protections and readiness,” said Dr. Shauna Stahlman, deputy chief of epidemiology and analysis at AFHSD. “His leadership shows that when we preserve the past with purpose, we equip the future with possibility.” Data-driven service provides ‘meaningful change’ for readiness The Distinguished Civilian Service Awards are reserved each year for a small number of career civilians whose work has a department-wide impact. The award honors a career that has shown how advanced health surveillance and secure, integrated data systems serve what DHA calls “medicine for the mission” — protecting the force, promoting health, and ensuring the military remains ready to respond. Data, Rubertone said, “has the power to drive meaningful change, especially when it comes to public health and national security.” At the cornerstone of his renowned career, Rubertone emphasized, is his dedication in using this data to help the warfighter. “There's a constant challenge to innovate, to adapt to evolving threats, and to find new ways to use data to improve the health and readiness of our warfighters,” he said. “I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9438883/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-12 10:56:24.105866

About the Armed Services Blood Program: Since 1962, the ASBP has been the U.S. military’s official blood program.","FORT LEONARD WOOD, Mo. — For the fourth time in as many blood drives, a training company with one of the smallest class sizes and the shortest training duration earned a spot in the Fort Leonard Wood Blood Donor Center’s 100-Donor Club.

Company A, 58th Transportation Battalion, first joined the club in April by having 118 Soldiers volunteer to donate blood to the Armed Services Blood Program. They repeated this success with 121 donors in June; 132 in August; and 119 in October. In total, 503 Soldiers — nearly 40% of their available class population — volunteered to give the gift of life.

During a six-week course, Alpha Company trains Soldiers to be truck drivers. Coordinating a large-scale ASBP blood drive required precise timing, according to Capt. William Breceda Cooper, Company A commander.

“We reviewed each class’s arrival and departure dates to find when the most Soldiers would be available,” he said. “Once we identified the best time, we scheduled the drive and motivated the Soldiers to donate.”

Breceda Cooper credits awareness and engaged leadership as key factors in the company’s success.

“Many Soldiers don’t know about the ASBP,” he said. “Sharing information and having senior leaders encourage donations makes a big difference.”

He also emphasized the importance of personal stories from cadre about times they or their families needed blood.

“Blood donations saved my father’s life in Afghanistan in 2006,” he shared.

Since then, Breceda Cooper said he has tried to donate whenever he has a chance.

The Fort Leonard Wood Blood Donor Center has held several blood drives in 2025, averaging about three dozen volunteers each. Company A’s drive nearly quadruples that number, which Lynee Miller, donor center supervisor, finds very encouraging.

“It’s inspiring to see young men and women donate for a cause bigger than themselves, especially with leadership’s support,” she said. “Their generosity helps many people fight illness and injury.”

The 100-Donor Club recognizes organizations that have 100 or more eligible donors volunteer during a single-day blood drive. There are currently 31 members. Each member has their unit’s name, donor counts, and drive dates etched on a plaque hanging in the donor center lobby. They also receive a Giving 4 Living streamer from the Association of the United States Army.

The ASBP, the official blood provider for the U.S. military, ensures a steady supply of blood products is available for service members worldwide. The military health system requires hundreds of blood units each day and looks to the ASPB to ensure they’re available. The ASBP then relies on volunteer donors to meet those ongoing demands.

“This milestone makes me proud of my team—senior NCOs who facilitate, encourage, and motivate Soldiers,” Breceda Cooper said. “It also highlights the selfless sacrifice of the Soldiers who donated. Their actions show they’re part of something greater than themselves. Donating blood is a small act that can save lives.”

Early fleet deployment strengthens operational readiness and accelerates the Navy’s transition to next-generation medical technology.

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The USS Carney (DDG 64) has officially gone live with T6 Health Systems’ OpMed Care Delivery Platform (CDP), marking a significant advancement in the Navy’s modernization of shipboard medical technology. The new commercial off-the-shelf solution replaces a longstanding electronic health record system and introduces a more agile, mission-ready capability designed to support the realities of care in maritime and contested environments.

As one of the Navy’s earliest implementation sites, Carney will play a critical role in shaping the evolution of OpMed CDP across the fleet. Feedback from medical personnel and operational users will drive rapid refinement cycles and guide deployment strategy as the Navy scales a more resilient, data-driven approach to operational medicine.

OpMed CDP is engineered to provide care teams with a clear, real-time operating picture -streamlining documentation, integrating essential clinical data, sharpening decision making, and enabling health information to move seamlessly with the patient. These advances strengthen readiness and improve continuity of care in the dynamic scenarios faced by sailors and medical staff underway.

""The Navy operates in some of the most demanding environments in the world, and sailors deserve medical technology built for that mission,” said Igor Muravyov, Chief Operating Officer at T6 Health Systems. “The USS Carney’s deployment of OpMed CDP reflects the Department of War’s commitment to modernizing shipboard medicine and ensuring that warfighters have the most advanced technologies to enhance lethality of our forces everywhere.”

The deployment aboard Carney adds to a period of significant growth and momentum for T6 Health Systems. In recent weeks, T6’s technology has gone live at the White House, Brooke Army Medical Center and Al Dhafra Air Base - demonstrating the platform’s versatility across global operational and executive care environments. The company was also recently awarded a multi-year agreement with the Defense Health Agency and PEO DHMS to further configure its commercial offering as a secure, cloud-enabled capability supporting the next generation of operational medicine. These milestones underscore T6’s expanding role as a key technology partner in advancing modern, interoperable solutions across the Military Health System.

A GOP-issued summary of the legislation says the NDAA authorizes $291 billion for maintenance and operations; $234 billion for military personnel and health care; $162 billion for procurement; $146 billion for research and development; $34 billion for nuclear defense programs; and $20 billion for military construction and family housing.
That includes over $2.7 billion in essential military construction projects and expands in that region.
It permanently repeals all existing Defense Department diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices, programs, training and activities, as well as future DEI-related endeavors.
It cuts climate change-related programs at the Defense Department.","The $900 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday in bipartisan fashion. The final version includes and also left out key provisions after months of negotiations by lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

The 3,086-page bill passed the House on a 312-112 vote (115 Democrats, 197 Republicans voted in favor) with Republicans and Democrats finding enough common ground to forward the legislation to the Senate—where it is expected to pass the GOP-controlled chamber and then be signed by President Donald Trump.

This year’s NDAA, passed annually by Congress, appropriates large amounts of funding that will impact the departments of Defense and Energy, health care, troops and salaries, research and development, immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, collective bargaining, and diversity initiatives. Not all lawmakers got what they wanted but high-ranking committee members expressed mostly positive sentiments after the bill’s passing.

“This is a strong bipartisan bill that delivers for our warfighters and deters our adversaries,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) said on the House floor prior to the bill’s passing. “It will fundamentally reform the defense acquisition enterprise. It will continue historic improvements in the quality of life for our servicemembers and their families.

“It will build the ready, capable, and lethal fighting force we need to deter China and our other adversaries. And it will deliver on President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda. I urge all members to support it.”

Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), the ranking Democrat on the committee, called the bill “the most ambitious swing at acquisition reform that we’ve taken,” according to the Associated Press.

“This NDAA falls short. Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth are deploying troops to our streets, carrying out extrajudicial killings, and undermining our military readiness. Congress must reassert its oversight. We need accountability—not just handouts to Trump,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA), a senior Armed Services Committee member, in a post on X.

Big Money

The House-passed bill in part authorizes some military construction projects and extends their authorization from previous fiscal years; requires the Department of Defense to develop a national strategy on the security implications of emerging biotechnologies; requires the Navy to implement certain processes to improve combat readiness of surface ships maintained and repaired at private shipyards; and extends the Pacific Deterrence Initiative which designed to enhance U.S. deterrence and defense posture in the Indo-Pacific region.

A GOP-issued summary of the legislation says the NDAA authorizes $291 billion for maintenance and operations; $234 billion for military personnel and health care; $162 billion for procurement; $146 billion for research and development; $34 billion for nuclear defense programs; and $20 billion for military construction and family housing.

Lawmakers say the FY 2026 bill overall will save taxpayers nearly $20 billion, including $40.5 million from eliminating DEI activities; $1.6 billion in cuts to climate change-related spending; $1.2 billion from retiring obsolete aircraft and ships; $6.8 billion from reductions in “unnecessary Pentagon bureaucracy”; $5.5 billion in cuts to consulting and service contracts; and $3.7 billion in cuts to inefficient defense programs.

NDAA’s Major Inclusions

Some of the NDAA’s major highlights are as follows:

A 3.8% pay raise for all military servicemembers, in addition to reauthorizing and expanding military bonuses and special pays; increases family separation allowance for deployed servicemembers; and requires a study to improve the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing to ensure it keeps up with rising rental costs.

$400 million for Ukraine security assistance.

It extends the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) to improve U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific region, including funding increases for new technologies needed to deter China such as hypersonic missiles, AI, autonomous systems, cyber, mobile micronuclear reactors, and high energy lasers. That includes over $2.7 billion in essential military construction projects and expands in that region.

Full funding ($1 billion) towards the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative.

$1.5 billion in new security assistance for the Philippines.

It formally establishes and authorizes $175 million for the Baltic Security Initiative to strengthen the defensive capability and interoperability of the Baltic states.

Full funding for the deployment of National Guard and active-duty troops in support of border patrol at the United States’ southwest border, including over $1 billion to fight drug trafficking ($398 million for Defense Department support of counter-narcotics operations and $216 million for National Guard counter-drug programs—$100 million over the budget request).

Reforms to military construction that costs 35% more on average than commercial construction, including accelerating construction and reducing costs by granting military departments multiyear contracting authority and authorizing the use of accelerated design-build and progressive design-build contracting methods to cut costs and speed up projects.

Oversight of Defense Department spending by way of fully funding the department’s Inspector General audit activities and requiring the department to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the status of balances and activities of funds previously approved within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year.

More than $131 million for the construction of new military dining facilities and over $1.5 billion for new construction of barracks and family housing.

More than $335 million to renovate military hospitals and build new medical facilities, which includes better access to specialty care by lowering the threshold for travel reimbursement for medical appointments from 100 to 75 miles.

More than $491 million to design and build new childcare centers, including annual reviews of childcare costs and a pilot program to increase childcare financial assistance in high-cost areas.

More than $206 million to build new schools for children of servicemembers and allows National Guard and reserve members called to active duty to enroll their children in Defense Department schools. It also authorizes $50 million in Impact Aid assistance to public schools with military dependent students, and an additional $20 million in assistance to local schools teaching children with severe disabilities.

It extends military recruitment bonuses.

It prohibits the retirement of certain F-15E, A-10, C-130, E-3, RQ-4, and Grey Eagle aircraft, as well as the closure of the E-7A Wedgetail production line.

$26 billion in shipbuilding funding for the construction and support of numerous vessels including the third Columbia-class Ballistic Missile Submarine, one Virginia-class Submarine, one anti-submarine warfare auxiliary ship, and future procurements.

More than $38 billion for the development, procurement or modification of aircraft including full funding for the U.S. Air Force’s F-47 and Navy’s F/A-XX 6th Generation Aircraft programs.

Builds the “Golden Dome” to update national missile defense policy.

What's Not in the Bill

Some of what was excluded in the final version are as follows:

The final bill ultimately did not include a provision mandating health care coverage for assisted reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty service members. As previously reported by Military.com, some Democrats and numerous reproductive organizations warned prior to the final version that its removal would prevent the expansion of IVF access to all servicemembers due to current insurance plans through TRICARE.

It permanently repeals all existing Defense Department diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices, programs, training and activities, as well as future DEI-related endeavors.

It cuts climate change-related programs at the Defense Department.

It removes Section 1110, the bipartisan House provision that would have restored collective bargaining rights for the Defense Department’s civilian workforce and would have prevented the department from using the bill’s funds to enforce an executive order that strips collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of DoD civilians.

Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO), urged GOP colleagues in November to strip the provision from the final call, saying in an X post that it was “designed to stop union bosses from slowing down critical defense operations by pushing ineffective policies that hurt productivity” and would cause “political interference.”

Hegseth’s Travel Budget Tied to Caribbean Boat Strikes

The House-passed version also includes a provision to withhold a quarter of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget until the Pentagon provides Congress with unedited videos of Caribbean airstrikes against alleged drug smuggling boats, according to reports.

It was included on the heels of the ongoing controversy surrounding orders to allegedly kill two survivors from a Sept. 2 strike, and further investigations by GOP-led House and Senate committees into whether that second strike was properly authorized and amounted to war crimes. The investigations remain ongoing.

Codifying Trump's Executive Orders

The NDAA also codifies all or parts of 15 executive orders issued by President Trump, including the following:

Restoring America's Fighting Force (EO 14185)

Ending Radical and Wasteful Government Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Programs and Preferencing (EO 14151)

Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border (Proclamation 10886)

Securing Our Borders (EO 14165)

Clarifying the Military's Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the U.S. (EO 14167)

BETHESDA, Md. – Walter Reed National Military Medical Center’s new approach to medical care begins with Walter’s Way and continues with the voices of those who use it every day. This model is transforming the patient and staff experience through improved flexibility, easier access to care, and a renewed focus on whole-person wellness.

Several clinical departments, including Primary Care, Pediatrics, and Dermatology, have already adopted the Walter’s Way model. As these areas shift to more proactive care, they are also implementing new tools to gather direct feedback from patients and staff. This feedback is a cornerstone of Walter’s Way by helping teams evaluate what is working well, identifying opportunities for improvements, and strengthening the overall care experience.

To support continuous improvement, a dedicated Walter’s Way feedback form is now available for patients and families to share their experiences. Whether the feedback highlights success, points out a challenge, or suggests a new idea, every response plays a meaningful role in shaping the future of patient care at Walter Reed.

“We've had some positive feedback,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Simmons, Deputy Director for the Department of Medicine and Primary Care lead for Walter’s Way. “Families have even written in, or patients have written in comments to give great feedback about some of our Walter’s Way staff.”

As the hospital continues to refine and expand Walter’s Way, leadership remains committed to transparency, patient-centered care, and open communication. All patients and staff are encouraged to stay engaged, share insights, and help guide the evolution of this model.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 14:56:27.278130

TRICARE currently does not cover IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies.

The provision’s elimination mirrored a similar removal from last year’s defense bill and came amid opposition from pro-life advocates, who argued that standard IVF practices involve the creation and destruction of human embryos, making taxpayer funding unethical. The industry has faced criticism for operating with little oversight, leading to the discard of tens of thousands of so-called “excess” embryos annually – essentially human beings who are killed.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., drew credit from conservative groups for blocking the measure, which some Senate Republicans had labeled a “poison pill” during negotiations.

“This victory shows us a sensitivity to that,” said Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, referring to widespread moral concerns about IVF. “The people I’ve talked to in the administration have said very explicitly, you know, these concerns have been heard, these moral concerns.”

Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy for Students for Life of America, called the removal a step toward better alternatives. “IVF is not an industry that deserves blanket support and funding. We can do better,” she said.

Hamrick added that the process destroys “far more lives than are allowed to live and thrive,” and that “more pre-born lives are lost in IVF than abortion.”

“Unquestioning financial support props up an industry known to prey on people’s hopes for a child while ending many lives,” Hamrick said. “The move to pull the funding for IVF will free up resources to seek better answers.”

Lila Rose, president of Live Action, thanked Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

For the Military Crisis Line and the Veterans Crisis Line, dial 988 and press “1,” or text 838255. For Spanish, press “2.” Online chat is accessible from anywhere in the world.]

The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

The new commercial off-the-shelf solution replaces a longstanding electronic health record system and introduces a more agile, mission-ready capability designed to support the realities of care in maritime and contested environments.

As one of the Navy’s earliest implementation sites, Carney will play a critical role in shaping the evolution of OpMed CDP across the fleet. Feedback from medical personnel and operational users will drive rapid refinement cycles and guide deployment strategy as the Navy scales a more resilient, data-driven approach to operational medicine.

OpMed CDP is engineered to provide care teams with a clear, real-time operating picture -streamlining documentation, integrating essential clinical data, sharpening decision making, and enabling health information to move seamlessly with the patient. These advances strengthen readiness and improve continuity of care in the dynamic scenarios faced by sailors and medical staff underway.

""The Navy operates in some of the most demanding environments in the world, and sailors deserve medical technology built for that mission,” said Igor Muravyov, Chief Operating Officer at T6 Health Systems. “The USS Carney’s deployment of OpMed CDP reflects the Department of War’s commitment to modernizing shipboard medicine and ensuring that warfighters have the most advanced technologies to enhance lethality of our forces everywhere.”

The deployment aboard Carney adds to a period of significant growth and momentum for T6 Health Systems. In recent weeks, T6’s technology has gone live at the White House, Brooke Army Medical Center and Al Dhafra Air Base - demonstrating the platform’s versatility across global operational and executive care environments. The company was also recently awarded a multi-year agreement with the Defense Health Agency and PEO DHMS to further configure its commercial offering as a secure, cloud-enabled capability supporting the next generation of operational medicine. These milestones underscore T6’s expanding role as a key technology partner in advancing modern, interoperable solutions across the Military Health System.

""Today, I once again voted against passage of the Republican’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). While I support several important components of this legislation, I could not in good conscience vote for the bill in its entirety. The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $890 billion in additional Pentagon spending. That is $8 billion more than the Pentagon itself said it needed. Our greatest security threats have no military solutions, and it is time our budget reflects that. We must instead make the investments in health care, education, housing, clean air and water, and public transit that Americans deserve.

“Further, this legislation removed House-passed provisions that would lead to In vitro fertilization (IVF) coverage under TRICARE and restore collective bargaining rights to civilian employees. I was also discouraged to see that the bill still discriminates against the transgender community. With this year’s illegal military strikes against innocent boats in the Caribbean, the last thing we need to do is give the Pentagon even more power.

""Although I opposed this bill, there were several bright spots, including a 3.8% pay raise for all service members, the repeal of the 1991 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), and a new requirement for military personnel to display the name of the military service they are affiliated with when supporting civilian law enforcement activities in our communities.

""Despite these important provisions, this legislation exacerbates an already over-bloated Pentagon budget and funds several defense policies which will not make people any safer. This is why I could not support its final passage.""

Washington, D.C. — Today, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (VA-02) secured a number of wins for military families, shipyard workers, and Hampton Roads.

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $900.6 billion for national defense discretionary programs, strengthening America’s military while saving taxpayers nearly $20 billion through targeted cuts to wasteful spending and bureaucracy. It fully carries out President Trump’s “Peace Through Strength” agenda by rebuilding readiness, revitalizing the defense industrial base, securing the border, and improving quality of life for servicemembers and their families.

“Today’s legislation is a major win for our Armed Forces and for the men and women who risk their lives every day for our freedom,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “This NDAA makes our military more ready, more capable, and more lethal—while finally delivering the quality-of-life improvements our servicemembers and their families deserve.”

“As a Navy veteran, Navy spouse, and Navy mom, I am especially proud that this bill supports a 3.8% pay raise for our troops, invests over $1.5 billion in new housing, nearly $500 million in childcare centers, and more than $335 million to improve military hospitals and clinics,” Kiggans continued. “It strengthens TRICARE, improves mental health access, boosts childcare assistance, and helps military kids succeed in school.”

“This NDAA also delivers on our commitment to ‘Peace Through Strength’ by investing $26 billion in shipbuilding; over $25 billion to rebuild our munitions stockpiles; and more than $145 billion in cutting-edge research and development—including hypersonics, AI, unmanned systems, and new space capabilities,” she added. “It removes China from our supply chains, supports Israel’s security, secures our southern border, and makes sure our allies pay more for their own defense.”

“I came to Congress on a mission to rebuild our Navy, revitalize our shipyards, and take care of our all-volunteer force,” Kiggans concluded. “This bill moves us decisively in that direction. It strengthens our industrial base, advances American shipbuilding, and improves day-to-day life for our servicemembers and their families—especially those stationed in Hampton Roads and across coastal Virginia. As a third-generation veteran, I will always be the loudest voice for our military men and women in Congress.”

Highlights of this legislation are included but not limited to:

Implementing President Trump’s Peace Through Strength Agenda

Authorizes $900.6 billion in total national defense discretionary spending while saving nearly $20 billion through targeted cuts to wasteful climate programs, duplicative bureaucracy, inefficient contracts, and obsolete platforms.

Codifies all or parts of 15 of President Trump’s national security executive orders—including those restoring America’s fighting force, ending wasteful DEI programs, securing the border, modernizing defense acquisitions, deploying advanced nuclear energy, and unleashing American drone dominance.

Fully supports President Trump’s priority programs, including the Golden Dome missile defense initiative, next-generation fighter aircraft, submarines, warships, advanced munitions, and autonomous systems.

Improving Quality of Life for Servicemembers and Civilian Mariners

Supports a 3.8% pay raise for all servicemembers, reauthorizes and expands bonuses and special pays, increases Family Separation Allowance, and expands convalescent leave.

Authorizes over $1.5 billion for new construction of barracks and family housing, requires a plan to meet health and safety obligations in military housing, and strengthens oversight of privatized housing providers.

Authorizes more than $335 million to renovate military hospitals and build new medical facilities, prevents reductions in uniformed medical billets, improves specialty-care travel reimbursement (lowering the mileage threshold from 100 to 75 miles), and expands cooperation with civilian healthcare systems.

Authorizes over $491 million to design and build new childcare centers, extends the Child Care in Your Home pilot, and starts a pilot to increase childcare assistance in high-cost areas.

Invests more than $206 million to build new schools for military children, protects DoD schools from sudden closure, expands Impact Aid (including an additional $20 million for schools serving children with severe disabilities), allows Guard and Reserve families to enroll in DoD schools when activated, and permits schools to limit or ban student cell phone use.

Strengthens the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) by allowing retiring servicemembers to immediately move into careers in the defense industrial base and medical professions, establishing a spouse-focused transition pilot, and improving metrics to ensure servicemembers get timely access to resources.

Enhances military recruiting by extending enlistment bonuses, requiring uniform medical accession standards, improving recruiter access to schools, expanding JROTC units, and authorizing bonuses for hard-to-fill JROTC instructor positions.

Strengthens the Military Sealift Command workforce by eliminating pay caps for civil-service mariners and expanding commissary and MWR access, improving retention and supporting the readiness of the Navy’s global logistics fleet.

Strengthening Shipbuilding, Readiness & the Defense Industrial Base

Authorizes $26 billion in shipbuilding funding, including: the third Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine and advanced procurement for future submarines; one Virginia-class submarine plus advance procurement; advance procurement for future DDG-51 destroyers; full funding for the Ford-class aircraft carrier program; one anti-submarine warfare auxiliary ship; and two Ship-to-Shore Connector landing craft.

Invests over $25 billion to rebuild U.S. munitions stockpiles, including procurement of precision strike missiles, JAGMs, Naval Strike Missiles, Javelins, Stingers, Tomahawks, GMLRS, AMRAAMs, LRASMs, advanced anti-radiation missiles, JDAMs, MK-48 torpedoes, and artillery rounds.

Authorizes more than $145.7 billion for research, development, testing, and evaluation—including hypersonics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, autonomous platforms, directed-energy systems, and space-based capabilities.

Expands the use of the Defense Industrial Base Fund to invest in critical mineral mining and refining, demands multi-year procurement for high-demand munitions, and directs DoD to streamline qualification of advanced manufacturing methods like 3D printing.

Requires DoD to identify and remove regulatory barriers that discourage maintaining surge capacity, creates new forums to tackle parts obsolescence and supply-chain fragility, and launches a program to mature robotic automation for munitions manufacturing.

Strengthens the maritime and shipyard industrial base through military construction reforms—allowing accelerated and progressive design-build, expanded use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for complex projects, and enhanced Navy contracting flexibility for major shipyard modernization efforts.

Reforming Acquisition to Deliver for the Warfighter

Implements major elements of the “SPEED Act” to streamline acquisitions, creating a new accelerated requirements process focused on rapid, innovative solutions instead of slow, bespoke systems.

Centralizes program management under a portfolio acquisition executive to speed decisions, and requires early life-cycle sustainment planning to avoid long-term readiness gaps.

Puts commercial solutions first by requiring DoD to look to commercial off-the-shelf capabilities before launching expensive new development programs, removing burdensome compliance requirements for small businesses, and easing use of subscription services like commercial satellites.

Establishes the BOOST program within the Defense Innovation Unit to bridge the “Valley of Death” and transition promising technologies into operational use.

Modernizes Cost Accounting Standards implementation, eases regulatory burdens on smaller programs, and strengthens the acquisition workforce through improved training, public-private exchanges, and new pathways from the Defense Civilian Training Corps into civil service.

Ready, Capable, and Lethal Fighting Force

Improves readiness by mandating at least 90 days’ worth of F-35 parts by FY2028, ensuring amphibious ships receive a fair share of maintenance funding, investing in depot and arsenal capacity, and launching AI pilots to improve ground-vehicle maintenance.

This appears to have happened in this case since Dr. McGraw was not suspended until this October.
After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report.
The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated.
Why did the Army fail to take disciplinary actions against Dr. McGraw until his October 2025 suspension?","WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and U.S. Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), Jill Tokuda (D-HI), Nanette Barragan (D-CA), Lori Trahan (D-MA), Veronica Escobar (D-TX), and Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) led 58 members of the Democratic Women’s Caucus, House Democrats, and Democratic Senators in a letter to the Department of Defense (DOD) Acting Inspector General demanding accountability for the Army’s failure to stop widespread sexual misconduct.

Recently, over 80 women joined a lawsuit alleging that Dr. Major Blaine McGraw made sexual advances, directed lewd comments towards them, and secretly recorded patients during exams while working at Ford Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center. This included at least 10 patients McGraw saw in Hawaii when he served as a resident at Tripler Army Medical Center from 2019-2023. Dr. McGraw was not suspended from his position until October 2025.

“No woman should feel unsafe receiving medical care, especially during sensitive and private health services. Yet, far too many survivors have come forward with their experiences of alleged exploitation and abuse by a doctor who reportedly violated not just the basic principles of medical care and human decency, but also the expected conduct of a U.S. Army officer and physician,” said Senator Hirono. “The Department of Defense and U.S. Army must take accountability for their failure to rapidly respond to servicemembers and patient complaints. While nothing can reverse the harm reported by patients, a comprehensive investigation into this alleged misconduct, resulting in stronger protections for patients, is necessary to ensure that no one experiences abuse by our military health system again.”

In their letter, the lawmakers expressed their outrage over Army leadership’s inaction despite numerous complaints from servicemembers and their families that Dr. McGraw had sexually exploited patients in his care for years. They also explained some of the unconscionable abuses women experienced, including details from the story of Jane Doe.

The lawmakers shared how the Army ignored Jane Doe’s attempts to report her abuse:

“After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report. Instead, she was told to ‘call or send an email.’ Jane Doe alleges she called the hospital seven different times but she was dismissed and hung up on each time. The purported lack of response and urgency to respond to these complaints would clearly violate reporting policy and the Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program protocols.”

They also expressed deep concern in their letter that this abuse is part of a recurring pattern of the Army failing to intervene in reports and cases of sexual misconduct:

“In the lawsuit, female servicemembers and patients noted that a recurring issue was the lack of adequate response from Army leadership. Reportedly, when victims and their loved ones tried to make complaints with Army leadership, they were ‘refused meetings at every level.’ If true, these women deserve better. The alleged dismissive response from the Army demonstrates an immense failure at every level to properly support survivors.”

The members and senators concluded the letter by demanding a full investigation from the DOD Inspector General, explanations on how complaints were handled, and stronger protections to ensure no patient faces this abuse again:

“The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated. That said, the separate concerns raised by survivors about members of the Army at many levels not timely acting on their complaints must be confronted immediately. Additionally, we request that DoD IG investigate to determine whether personnel within the Army properly followed procedures to timely report allegations of sexual misconduct to law enforcement and whether other SAPR procedures and existing protections were followed or not.”

Last week, Senator Hirono and the Hawaii Congressional delegation also sent a letter calling on the DOD to thoroughly investigate every complaint against McGraw and the Army’s own failures in allowing his alleged misconduct to persist.

In addition to Senator Hirono and Representatives Houlahan, Tokuda, Barragan, Trahan, Escobar, and Garcia, the letter was also signed by Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Representatives Joyce Beatty (D-OH), Julia Brownley (D-CA), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL), Andre Carson (D-IN), Judy Chu (D-CA), Maxine Dexter (D-OR), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Sarah Elfreth (D-MD), Lizzie Fletcher (D-TX), Valerie Foushee (D-NC), Lois Frankel (D-FL), Laura Friedman (D-CA), Robert Garcia (D-CA), Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ), Val Hoyle (D-OR), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL), Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Julie Johnson (D-TX), Timothy Kennedy (D-NY), Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM), Lucy McBath (D-GA), Sarah McBride (D-DE), Betty McCollum (D-MN), James McGovern (D-MA), LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Kelly Morrison (D-MN), Seth Moulton (D-MA), Eleanor Norton (D-DC), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Nellie Pou (D-NJ), Delia Ramirez (D-IL), Emily Randall (D-WA), Deborah Ross (D-NC), Andrea Salinas (D-OR), Janice Schakowsky (D-IL), Lateefah Simon (D-CA), Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Norma Torres (D-CA), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Nikema Williams (D-GA), and Frederica Wilson (D-FL).

The full text of the letter is available here and below.

Dear Mr. Stebbins:

We write to express our strong concerns about the Army’s purported failure to timely intervene in the alleged misconduct of Dr. Major Blaine McGraw at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center, allegations, which if true, would possibly constitute the largest sexual misconduct case in U.S. military history. According to reports, for years, Dr. McGraw allegedly sexually exploited women, including servicewomen and military wives, in his care. When these women attempted to report their concerns and experiences were purportedly repeatedly ignored and Dr. McGraw was kept on staff. The Army, like the other Services, has a history of failing to adequately address sexual misconduct in the ranks, which required Congress to step in and institute hundreds of reforms over the last fifteen years, culminating in the establishment of the Office of the Special Trial Counsel in the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). One of those issues involved military services being slow to intervene in cases at an early stage. This appears to have happened in this case since Dr. McGraw was not suspended until this October. This delayed response is unacceptable, and we need answers. Separate, and not to interfere with the ongoing Army criminal investigation into the alleged misconduct of Dr. McGraw, we request the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General review if appropriate Military Health System policies were followed, to include whether patient complaints were timely evaluated and considered, and provide recommendations to the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to prevent further instances like this from occurring in the future.

This month over 80 women joined a lawsuit together alleging that Dr. McGraw made lewd sexual advances and comments towards them, as well as secretly recorded patients during exams. One example of the women’s horrific experiences is captured through Jane Doe’s story. After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report. Instead, she was told to “call or send an email.” Jane Doe alleges she called the hospital seven different times but she was dismissed and hung up on each time. The purported lack of response and urgency to respond to these complaints would clearly violate reporting policy and the Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program protocols.

In the lawsuit, female servicemembers and patients noted that a recurring issue was the lack of adequate response from Army leadership. Reportedly, when victims and their loved ones tried to make complaints with Army leadership, they were “refused meetings at every level.” If true, these women deserve better. The alleged dismissive response from the Army demonstrates an immense failure at every level to properly support survivors.

The allegations against Dr. McGraw, and the Army’s purported failure to timely address survivor complaints, are not isolated. A separate investigation deemed Fort Hood as a notoriously “permissive environment” for sexual harassment and assault. The base has been plagued by this issue for years. For example, in 2020, Army Specialist Vanessa Guillén was murdered by a fellow soldier while stationed at Fort Hood. Throughout her time on base, Specialist Guillén was sexually harassed by a separate supervisor. Specialist Guillén’s tragic murder was the impetus for the aforementioned changes in the FY22 NDAA. However, even with these positive reforms, it is clear more needs to be done. The fact that this reported abuse occurred at the same base as Specialist Guillen’s murder is appalling. All women should be safe on a military base, and they surely should be able to safely seek treatment without fear of sexual assault or abuse.

The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated. That said, the separate concerns raised by survivors about members of the Army at many levels not timely acting on their complaints must be confronted immediately. Additionally, we request that DoD IG investigate to determine whether personnel within the Army properly followed procedures to timely report allegations of sexual misconduct to law enforcement and whether other SAPR procedures and existing protections were followed or not. We therefore request a response to the following questions from the Defense Health Agency and the Inspector General within 60 days of receipt:

Please provide the range of dates for the sexual harassment/assault complaints filed, including the number of complaints received at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center relating to Dr. McGraw.

What was the Military Treatment Facility management’s response to each complaint at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center?

How did the Military Treatment Facility management at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center follow appropriate policies to supervise staff, prevent patient harm, and address patient complaints?

What are the next steps the Military Treatment Facility management at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center will take to further protect patients from sexual assault?

How will the Defense Health Agency ensure that no Military Treatment Facility will ignore sexual abuse allegations again?

How will the Defense Health Agency prevent future concealment and employment of sexual abusers on their staff across Military Treatment Facilities?

Was a quality assurance investigation initiated? If so, please share the status with the House Armed Services Committee.

Why did the Army fail to take disciplinary actions against Dr. McGraw until his October 2025 suspension?

We are committed to demanding justice for victims of sexual assault and harassment, and we will not stay silent while the safety of women is at risk. Again, we request prompt and thorough answers to these questions to prevent further harm and hold those responsible for this accountable.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Sincerely,

However, whether the universal access has translated into improved patient outcome is unknown. This study compared survival of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the MHS with that in the U.S. general population.

Methods: The MHS data were obtained from The Department of Defense's (DoD) Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR), and the U.S. population data were drawn from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The study subjects were NSCLC patients diagnosed between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 2012, in ACTUR and a sample of SEER patients who were matched to the ACTUR patients on age group, sex, race, and year of diagnosis group with a matching ratio of 1:4.

Read the full article here.

This research addresses a critical gap in understanding treatment pathways for musculoskeletal shoulder conditions—one of the most frequent causes of pain and disability among active-duty service members and veterans. By analyzing longitudinal data from the Military Health System, the team identified patterns in healthcare utilization, including diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, surgical interventions, and medication use.

""Our findings provide a clearer picture of how care is delivered for shoulder disorders in a large, integrated health system. This knowledge is essential for identifying opportunities to improve efficiency and ensure patients receive the right care at the right time,"" said Steven Z. George, PT, PhD, professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

Key Findings:

Shoulder disorders represent a significant burden in military populations, often requiring multi-modal care.

Utilization patterns varied based on diagnosis type, patient demographics, and care setting.

The study highlights opportunities to optimize care delivery, reduce unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes.

Why It Matters:

Musculoskeletal injuries are among the leading causes of limited duty and medical discharge in the military. Understanding how patients navigate care systems can inform evidence-based guidelines, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient-centered care for both military and civilian populations.

""By examining real-world data from the Military Health System, we can better understand treatment patterns and identify gaps in care. These insights are critical for developing strategies that improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs,"" said Maggie E.

The House passed a defense authorization bill Dec. 10 without a provision to allow health care coverage of in vitro fertilization for active-duty military.

Pro-life groups cheered the provision’s removal from the bill. The original bill would have required Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “ensure that fertility-related care for a member of the uniformed services on active duty (or a dependent of such a member) shall be covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.” Tricare does not cover IVF.

The House passed the bill (S. 1071) by a vote of 312-112, and Senate consideration is next.

Like last year, the IVF provision was eliminated from the defense authorization bill shortly before its consideration. President Donald Trump had made a campaign promise to make IVF free.

A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNA in a statement that “President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF.”

“The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” the spokesperson said.

Live Action President Lila Rose praised Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

“Students for Life has opposed IVF as practiced, as it's a business model that by design, destroys far more lives than are allowed to live and thrive,” Students for Life Vice President Kristy Hamrick told CNA in a statement responding to Speaker Mike Johnson’s move to strip the bill of IVF provisions. “The move to pull the funding for IVF will free up resources to seek better answers,” she said.

“Unquestioning financial support props up an industry known to prey on people's hopes for a child while ending many lives. We need to seek better answers for the question of how to help people have families than to assume that IVF is the solution,” she said. “We can do better.”

The Advancing American Freedom Foundation, which is led by former Vice President Mike Pence, posted a memo on X stating “many pro-life Americans are opposed to IVF because the standard process destroys human embryos.”

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council reacted to news that IVF would be cut from the bill by praising Johnson, and said in a post on X: “The Speaker is right to put the pause on IVF funding in the Defense spending bill.”

“The IVF industry operates with little, if any, oversight, which has led to the creation and destruction of tens of thousands of so-called ‘excess’ embryos,” he said. “There are other pro-life options. Taxpayers' dollars should fund fertility methods that respect human dignity, treat the underlying causes of infertility, AND are successful—like Restorative Reproductive Medicine.”",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/invitrofertilization022025.jpg?jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 07:57:07.149522

Recent analysis found 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will no longer be able to afford ACA marketplace coverage if these credits are not extended.

Blumenthal pressed the urgency of addressing this issue ahead of a vote tomorrow on a Democratic proposal to extend ACA enhanced premium tax credits for three years before they expire at the end of the year: “…[W]e have to recognize the importance of votes that we will take tomorrow, one of them to extend the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that will affect literally 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits to afford health insurance. And whether you support the ACA, whether you have other views on what might be a perfect system in the long run if we had tons of time, the simple fact is we face a deadline at the end of the year when these tax credits will expire and 267,000 veterans will no longer be able to afford ACA coverage if these credits are not extended.”

The Senator continued, “These are primarily veterans not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, and often not eligible to get care through VA – leaving them with ACA marketplace plans as their only option for health care coverage. The ACA isn’t perfect… but the fact of the matter is the consequences of failing to extend these tax credits will be devastating for veterans and their families. Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm – an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance. They deserve better. So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits. I hope that we approve them to the benefit of those veterans and countless other Americans affected.”

Veterans who benefit from ACA tax credits are primarily those not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, or who are not eligible to get some or all of their health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In addition, 1.6 million veterans and four million family members of veterans utilize Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage because of the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One in ten veterans under the age of 65 rely on Medicaid, and forty percent of these veterans rely on Medicaid as their sole coverage.

Republicans have thus far refused to work with Democrats to extend the enhanced premium tax credits that have helped millions of Americans afford health insurance. Now, tens of millions of Americans across the country are staring down increased health insurance rates that are set to double and even triple their monthly premiums. Coupled with Republicans’ Medicare and Medicaid cuts that go into effect next year, Americans, including millions of veterans, are bracing for higher costs and a looming health care crisis.

Video of Blumenthal’s opening statement is available here and the full text is copied below.

Senator Blumenthal: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to hear testimony on some very important bipartisan legislation today. But, before we begin, I think we have to recognize the importance of votes that we will take tomorrow, one of them to extend the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that will affect literally 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits to afford health insurance. And whether you support the ACA, whether you have other views on what might be a perfect system in the long run if we had tons of time, the simple fact is we face a deadline at the end of the year when these tax credits will expire and 267,000 veterans will no longer be able to afford ACA coverage if these credits are not extended.

These are primarily veterans not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, and often not eligible to get care through VA – leaving them with ACA marketplace plans as their only option for health care coverage. The ACA isn’t perfect. We need to lower the costs of health care generally. We need to work on reforms, and we need to eliminate any fraud that exists in these programs, but the fact of the matter is the consequences of failing to extend these tax credits will be devastating for veterans and their families. Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm - an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance. They deserve better. So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits. I hope that we approve them to the benefit of those veterans and countless other Americans affected.

On the legislation today, I particularly want to thank Mr. Stichman for his work, alongside the Yale Veterans Legal Services Clinic, to improve how federal appellate courts process VA appeals.

I’ve worked with the Yale Veterans Legal Services Clinic over the years, and I know how important their work is generally. The Veterans Appeals Efficiency Act, which I co-lead with Senator Banks, is one of many bills that we’re here to discuss. And I will be supporting many, if not all of them. For example, the Molly Loomis Act which would build on the promise of the PACT Act by exploring health conditions prevalent among descendants of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during their service. And we have to confront, as well, the painful legacy of discrimination. The Commission on Equity and Reconciliation in the Uniformed Services Act would investigate the harm done to LGBTQ+ servicemembers and veterans, many of whom received punitive discharges, and were forced to hide their identities and ultimately denied benefits.

These measures are not partisan. This Committee generally is not partisan. And I welcome the support of my Republican colleagues for many of these important measures that we hopefully will advance after today’s hearing.

Mental health professionals are not immune to the pressures associated with deployments or their care of service members and their families. Many specialists put their own advice into practice, seeking support when faced with mental health challenges.

One of the most important first steps they can take is finding someone to help ease the load. That’s the advice of Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist who is the director for psychological health for the U.S. Navy.

Long said she found it challenging to reconnect with her family after a deployment to Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. She and her spouse discovered couples’ counseling through their local Fleet and Family Service Center that combined with resources for their toddler.

The couples’ counseling “made such a difference, because I knew what I wanted, and I knew that it was important for me to reconnect. I just didn't know exactly how to do that,” Long said. “Just a little bit ironic, given what I do, but we all need help sometimes.”

Therapy helps resolve bad experiences

Long praised her experience seeking support. “Therapy can be so helpful for folks, whether they're struggling with relationships, anxiety, depression, or trauma-related symptoms. In some ways, it forces us to confront our problems.”

“Most of us want to compartmentalize our issues. We don't want to think about our negative past experiences and problems. We want to distract ourselves or focus on career or something else,” Long said. “Therapy gives us that dedicated time and space to talk through something, to gain that awareness, that insight.”

Therapy can identify what is contributing to a mental health challenge. “Having someone guide that process helps,” said Long. “We do it together because it's not easy to figure it out on our own.”

“I think focusing efforts on strengthening true connections, and having service members supporting others can go a long way,” she said.

“I’ve seen mental health (counselors) … it’s not a secret and I’m wildly open about it,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., noting that he sought care through military family life counselors and Military OneSource.

Mental health professionals are “not perfect. We all feel overwhelmed?” Cote said. “Seeking these resources has been beneficial in that I can treat my patients better now.”

Long said her own success with counseling could parallel with anyone who needs support — wherever they are in their mental health journey.

“Connection with others — true, deep, meaningful connection with others — that’s one of the things that can draw people to the service,” she said.

Long said fears of losing security clearances, not promoting, or separation from the military may hinder a service member from seeking help. However, a study from 2021 to 2023 by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency found barely 1/100th of 1% of cases resulted in security denials or revocations were due to psychological health and additional conditions.

In fact, DCSA said seeking support leads to recovery and is more likely to enhance a military career than harm it, because of the openness demonstrated by the applicant in the process.

Get help early to boost recovery

Unfortunately, some people don't seek help until they're in crisis mode, which can make recovery harder. “Not impossible,” Long said. “But it requires so much more work to intervene later versus earlier.”

“Getting help early is critical and connecting with someone is such an important protective factor against suicide,” Long said. “There's so much more opportunity to get to work on something, to improve before it becomes a crisis.”

Available Military Health System mental health resources

The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a comprehensive listing of mental health services available throughout the MHS. This includes options to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on a variety of resources. You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click.

Targeted Care. This new process connects you to the specific type of care you need after an initial evaluation — and can be an individual appointment, in-person group therapy or virtual group therapy. Targeted care is now available at many military mental health clinics.

TRICARE covered mental health services are available through its worldwide network of civilian providers. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit the mental health doctors and appointments page.

Virtual care: The Defense Health Agency continues to expand mental health services available to service members at remote installations. One example is BRAVE, the DHA’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, provides tele-mental health services at 84 locations around the world by connecting service members with counselors through virtual sessions.

inTransition is a confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and retirees, who are receiving mental health or traumatic brain injury care and experiencing disruption in their lives, like a PCS (permanent change of station) move, separation, or retirement.

The Real Warriors Campaign, a Department of War public health initiative, strives to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and encourage early mental health help-seeking behaviors in the military community.

The Warrior Care Recovery Coordination Program, executed by the three branches of service, provides holistic care to wounded, ill, or injured service members and their families and caregivers. Recovery Care Coordinators serve as a guide through recovery, rehabilitation, and transition or reintegration by facilitating a comprehensive recovery plan. This plan covers needs associated with daily living, career, family, finances, health, legal, military issues, and spirituality.

The Brandon Act is a law that empowers service members to receive the help they need by seeking a referral for a mental health evaluation through their commander or supervisor. This guidance helps with the process. The purpose of the Brandon Act is to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.

Military OneSource. Service members and their families can also receive referrals to nonmedical support such as a chaplain, financial advisor, or a military family life counselor through Military OneSource, a one-stop 24/7 gateway to trusted resources, information, and confidential help. Call 800-342-9647. Military OneSource can also help with referrals such as the impact of a parent on deployment to a child’s health and happiness, or a substance abuse issue.

The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

“Michigan National Guard members selflessly serve our state and nation, making sacrifices on a daily basis to keep our communities and loved ones safe.
The new program will help eligible Michigan National Guard members pay for child care costs during weekend drills or annual training.
“National Guard members have the same day-to-day responsibilities and costs anyone else does, including child care,” said state Senator Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores).
“Our National Guard members put their lives on hold to serve and protect our state,” said state Senator Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe).","LANSING, Mich. — Today, Governor Whitmer signed Senate Bills 370, 540, and 542. These bills will lower the cost of health care and child care for members of the Michigan National Guard and their families. These bipartisan bills will strengthen the support systems service members rely on and ensure they can focus on their missions knowing that their families are safe and cared for. Including today’s legislation, Governor Whitmer has signed a record 1,539 bipartisan bills into law since taking office.

“These bills reaffirm our commitment to fight for those who fight for us,” said Governor Whitmer. “We are lowering the cost of health care and child care for members of the Michigan National Guard, ensuring they can carry out their missions to keep us all safe and provide for their families too. I’m proud that legislators worked across the aisle to pass these commonsense bills, building on years of bipartisan progress we have made to help our National Guard balance their service and their daily lives. Let’s keep working together to make health care and child care more affordable for everyone and stay focused on getting things done that make a real difference in people’s lives.”

Senate Bill 370, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), will require the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA) to create and operate a Tricare premium reimbursement program, lowering the cost of health care for Michiganders who serve in the National Guard.

“Michigan National Guard members selflessly serve our state and nation, making sacrifices on a daily basis to keep our communities and loved ones safe. It’s incumbent upon us as elected officials to do all we can to protect them in return,” said state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing). “I’m proud to see this legislation signed into law, ensuring our guardsmen and women can access the health and dental care they need, when they need it, while improving troop readiness, recruitment, and retention along the way.”Senate Bill 540, sponsored by state Senator Kevin Hertel (D-Saint Clair Shores), will create the Michigan National Guard Child Care Assistance Program within the DMVA. The new program will help eligible Michigan National Guard members pay for child care costs during weekend drills or annual training.

“National Guard members have the same day-to-day responsibilities and costs anyone else does, including child care,” said state Senator Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores). “When they take the selfless step to sign up for service, their actions deserve to be honored with our fullest support. This legislation helps us meet their needs by providing critical child care benefits to our guardsmen and women so they can serve our community with the peace of mind that their families are cared for.”

Senate Bill 542, sponsored by state Senator Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe), is tie-barred to SB 540 and will require the balance remaining in the Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Fund at the end of the fiscal year to be transferred to the Michigan National Guard Member Benefits Fund.

“Our National Guard members put their lives on hold to serve and protect our state,” said state Senator Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe). “Providing them with tuition assistance is one way our state can give back, helping them pursue their goals, build their careers, and continue serving our communities in and out of uniform.”",https://senatedems.com/hertel/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/12/IMG_1334-scaled.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-12-10 16:56:34.448570
