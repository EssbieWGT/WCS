Some of those assets are people such as Ashely Piper, the command’s first Employee of the Quarter for 2025, who dedicates herself to advancing emerging research.

As a research microbiologist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases’ Viral Pathogenesis Branch, Piper is part of a nearly 60-year history of the institute detecting and defending against current and emerging biological threats. The research that Piper conducts for the institute helps make DHA R&D-MRDC a leader in global health security and in regions where Warfighters are often deployed.

“Ms. Piper’s exceptional technical and leadership skills were keys to the successful planning and execution of pivotal animal model studies in support of the Institute of Infectious Diseases' mission of developing medical countermeasures against emerging biothreat agents,” said Maj. Gen. Paula Lodi, commanding general of DHA R&D-MRDC.

Piper has been fortunate to call the institute her home and career for nearly two decades. Early in her journey, tenured researchers helped her to develop a deep understanding of infectious disease research focused on the Warfighter. But as long as Piper has been at USAMRIID, she feels in a literal sense, she is training the next generation of scientists.

Some of the junior enlisted Soldiers she trains may have hospital or lab experience, but often lack experience operating in a biosafety level environment. Piper addresses this by beginning their training in lower-level labs, and once they are ready, she transitions them to BSL-3 or BSL-4 labs to provide them with more in-depth virology experience.

As she leads the virology division’s animal studies, she teaches junior enlisted one of the most established and reliable methods in virology: plaque assays, a measure of adding virus particles to permissive cells and applying a semisolid overlay that limits the spread of infection to neighboring cells, thus causing cell death leading to the formation of plaques. Plaque assays are a skillset that Sgt. Adam Crawford, a medical laboratory technician at the institute’s Viral Pathogenesis Branch, says is one of things that he and other Soldiers commonly agree what makes Piper, in his words, “simply awesome” in her mentorship.

“USAMRIID is my first research assignment, which operates differently from my other duty assignments, not just in security, but in practical science. I had never grown cells or produced plates of plaques to count. Ashley helped me learn what works best for me as she is a subject matter expert who I can rely on no matter what virus or procedure we are working on,” said Crawford.

Aspects of chemistry and biology have interested Piper since she was a teenager. Although her work currently focuses on virology, her educational background in chemistry occasionally proves helpful when her team conducts studies. Today, some of the medical countermeasures that Piper is studying includes pathogenic responses to different diseases like Chikungunya, a common mosquito-related virus in tropical and subtropical regions where U.S. military assets are present, and developing treatments for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.

After the initial 1976 Ebola outbreak, the DOD responded with a whole-of-government approach, developing vaccines and diagnostic tools for patient care. As the virus reemerged over the years, Piper became one of the institute’s subject matter experts studying an Ebola viral response, and so much so, in 2014 she traveled from Fort Detrick, Maryland to Fort Campbell, Kentucky to train Soldiers deploying to a region in Africa with a current outbreak, helping them defend themselves against the threat.

“Being a part of the response team those two weeks at Fort Campbell was one of the most memorable parts of my career,” said Piper. “It was a rewarding feeling to know that I had a direct impact in training our military personnel during the Ebola outbreak in 2014.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9024159/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-09 00:56:31.595750

“You knew what you were signing up for.” Ah, yes.
From the comment section on a military spouse support thread.
You can know military life comes with hard seasons and still feel wrecked by them.
So the next time someone says, “Well, you knew what you were signing up for,” feel free to smile sweetly and reply: “Sure did.","But just because you knew doesn’t make it any easier. Being prepared doesn’t cancel out the hard parts.

There’s a phrase that gets tossed at military spouses like a passive-aggressive grenade—smiling on the outside, condescending on the inside.

“You knew what you were signing up for.”

Ah, yes. The Greatest Hits of Things No One Asked You to Say, Vol. 1.

You’ll hear it everywhere. From a well-meaning aunt who’s never moved out of her hometown. From the comment section on a military spouse support thread. From the spouse of someone in another branch implying that their lifestyle is harder. (Congratulations on your suffering, Janet.)

And maybe, on your lowest days, you’ve even said it to yourself. Quietly, like a warning: “You knew what you signed up for. Get it together.”

Except. No.

Yes, you did “sign up” when you said yes to getting married. Sure, you probably knew that the job came with spontaneous goodbyes, weird hours, relocations, Tricare. And maybe there was the briefest awareness that once you said, “I do,” you’d never (ever) think about civilian life the same.

You knew.

But did you know what it would feel like to explain to your kid why Mom or Dad missed their birthday again? To forever use pencil on a calendar and not pen because you know all plans will eventually change, no matter what?

Did you know what it would do to your nervous system to live in a constant state of “maybe”? Did you know you’d become a one-woman or one-man logistics team, therapist, and spiritual advisor every time a deployment cycle started?

Let’s be clear: knowing doesn’t make it easier. Knowing just means you’re bracing for impact. You still have to survive it. Thrive through it, even. And here you are, one cup of coffee, one Command hook, one unhinged PCS binder at a time.

Myth #1: You knew, so you can’t complain

Look, we all read the fine print, or at least skimmed it. We knew what we were stepping into. But knowing the stove is hot doesn’t mean you enjoy burning your hand on it every two years.

You can know military life comes with hard seasons and still feel wrecked by them. You can anticipate a goodbye and still fall apart at the gate. You can mentally prepare for being the solo parent, the house fixer, the emotional anchor and still want to scream into a void when your partner’s deployment gets extended again with zero notice. When they get stuck at the office (again). When you can’t plan a date night because you have no idea if their chain is going to keep them (again).

This life demands a lot of you. And you’re allowed to be honest about that. Anyone who says otherwise should be gently escorted off your metaphorical porch.

Myth #2: Other people have had it worse

This one shows up in sneakier ways. You hear about someone whose spouse is deployed longer, whose housing situation is worse, whose kids are struggling harder. And suddenly you feel selfish for feeling anything at all.

But listen. Pain is not a competitive sport.

You don’t need to earn your right to struggle. You don’t need to hit a certain threshold of hardship before you’re allowed to say, “Hey, this really sucks.”

Your hard is hard. That’s enough. Comparison doesn’t heal anything. It just keeps us all pretending we’re fine when we’re absolutely not.

Myth #3: Grace is only for civilians

There’s this unspoken idea (sometimes whispered, sometimes shouted) that military spouses have to be tougher than the rest of the world. That grace, gentleness, softness… those are luxuries for people whose partners don’t wear a uniform. As if you forfeit softness the moment you marry into the military. As if breaking down means you’re not cut out for it.

Let’s call that what it is: a lie.

Here’s the truth. You’re allowed to unravel. To feel resentful. To be angry at the system that you love to support, worn thin by the emotional calculus you do every day just to keep things moving.

What you did sign up for

You signed up to love someone who serves. You signed up to walk beside them through the unknown. You signed up to build a life together that doesn’t always fit inside a neat timeline or fixed location.

The truth: grace, not grit

In case no one has told you: You’re not weak for finding all of this hard. You’re not dramatic for crying during commercials when you’re three months into deployment. You’re not a bad spouse for counting down the days until your partner comes home and also wanting five minutes of quiet once they do.

You’re human. You’re navigating a life built around sacrifice, uncertainty, and a very inconvenient knack for your spouse getting orders right before your kid finishes third grade.

You deserve support. You deserve softness. You deserve to say, “This is hard,” without someone handing you a lecture in response.

So the next time someone says, “Well, you knew what you were signing up for,” feel free to smile sweetly and reply:

“Sure did. And I still get to talk about it.”",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3345957-e1746745758399.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-08 19:56:16.272311

4. Jennifer Ellerhoff is the spouse of an E-5 ADSM stationed in Southeast Asia. She is enrolled in a family policy with TRICARE Select. On January 12, Jennifer has a medical encounter in a civilian outpatient clinic. The provider (a nonPAR) charged $240. This is the first medical encounter of the year for Jennifer and her two children. The TRICARE allowable charge (TMAC) for this procedure is $212. After the EOB is received, the clinic sends Jennifer a statement for $212. She calls and asks you why she has to pay this charge. How would you explain the reason why she owes this amount?

Explanation of Charges for Jennifer Ellerhoff

When Jennifer Ellerhoff received a statement for $212 after her medical encounter, it is important to understand how TRICARE Select processes claims and what the patient is responsible for. Here’s a breakdown of the situation:

Key Points

TRICARE Allowable Charge (TMAC): The TMAC for the procedure is $212. This is the maximum amount that TRICARE will reimburse for this service. TRICARE establishes this amount as the maximum allowable charge for covered services, and network providers agree to accept this approved amount as payment in full. However, non-participating providers, like the one Jennifer visited, can charge more than the TMAC.1

Provider Type: The provider is a non-participating provider (nonPAR). NonPAR providers do not have a contract with TRICARE and can charge more than the TMAC. They are allowed to bill the patient for the difference between their charge and the TMAC.2

Cost Sharing: Under TRICARE Select, Jennifer is responsible for a portion of the costs, which includes:

Deductible: If applicable, any deductible must be met before TRICARE starts to pay. TRICARE Select has an annual deductible, which is $300 for an individual and $600 for a family.3

Cost Share: After the deductible, Jennifer may have to pay a percentage of the TMAC as her cost share.

Breakdown of Charges

Provider Charge: $240 (the amount billed by the provider).

TRICARE Allowable Charge: $212 (the amount TRICARE recognizes for payment).

Patient Responsibility: Since the provider is a nonPAR, Jennifer is responsible for the difference between the TMAC and the provider's charge, plus any applicable cost share.

Conclusion

In summary, Jennifer owes the $212 because:

The provider charged $240, but TRICARE only covers up to $212.

As a nonPAR provider, the clinic can bill Jennifer for the full TMAC amount.

Depending on her deductible and cost share, she may be responsible for the entire TMAC amount.

If Jennifer has further questions about her specific deductible or cost share percentages, she should refer to her TRICARE Select plan details or contact TRICARE customer service for clarification.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit's allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“STIs are estimated to be experienced by about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. every year – this includes service members.
Current U.S. military STI surveillance reports show that rates of chlamydia declined between 2015 and 2023, but chlamydia remains the most commonly detected STI among service members.
“Because many service members who have chlamydia are unaware that they are infected, practicing safe sex and routine testing for chlamydia are essential to preventing further transmission and severe disease outcomes,” says Obuseh.
Most chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause noticeable symptoms but can still lead to serious health complications.","Sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, include both sexually transmitted diseases, known as STDs, and the many infections that don’t progress to disease. STIs are caused by more than 30 different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which are transmitted through skin-to-skin and bodily fluid contact during intimate sexual encounters.

The most commonly tracked STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. The Department of Defense has had an ongoing battle with them for decades.

“STIs are much more common than many realize,” says Francis Obuseh, a senior epidemiologist and Defense Health Agency–Public Health STI expert. “STIs are estimated to be experienced by about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. every year – this includes service members. Symptomatic infections and long-term complications can compromise service member readiness and well-being.”

Obuseh says the effects of STIs can show up days, weeks or even months after exposure in those who experience signs and/or symptoms. Before they develop symptoms, they may unknowingly pass the infection to other sexual partners.

But those who are symptomatic and seeking care don’t capture the full risk, he says.

“Especially concerning are asymptomatic STI cases, who are people who do not have symptoms but are ‘carriers’ who can still give the infection to others,” says Obuseh. “Unfortunately, many people, both men and women, fall in this asymptomatic category. Since they don’t have symptoms, these infected people typically don’t seek testing and treatment, continuing sexual activity and increasing STI spread.”

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to show chlamydia is a significant public health concern among civilians, and military STI surveillance has indicated chlamydia rates among service members are almost two times higher than among civilian U.S. adults.

Current U.S. military STI surveillance reports show that rates of chlamydia declined between 2015 and 2023, but chlamydia remains the most commonly detected STI among service members. The highest rates of chlamydia were observed in the Army and Marine Corps. Service members under 25 years of age were the most commonly infected.

According to recent DHA-PH data, the chlamydia infection rate of female service members is approximately three times higher than that of their male counterparts. However, the higher rates seen in females are thought to be mostly due to the routine testing required among young military women.

“Because many service members who have chlamydia are unaware that they are infected, practicing safe sex and routine testing for chlamydia are essential to preventing further transmission and severe disease outcomes,” says Obuseh.

Obuseh answers several common questions about chlamydia:

How can I prevent chlamydia?

The only way to completely avoid chlamydia is to abstain from vaginal, anal or oral sex. If you are sexually active, you can lower your chances of getting chlamydia by—

Engaging in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have chlamydia.

Using condoms the right way, consistently and correctly, every time you have sex.

How do I know if I have chlamydia, and what are the effects?

Most chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause noticeable symptoms but can still lead to serious health complications. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until several weeks after exposure.

Women:

Even without symptoms, chlamydia can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. This can include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic (outside the womb) chronic pelvic pain, and may make getting pregnant difficult or even impossible (known as infertility). Chlamydia can also cause a potentially fatal ectopic pregnancy.

Symptoms, if present, may include abnormal or smelly vaginal discharge, a burning sensation when urinating, and/or bleeding between periods.

If pregnant, a woman with chlamydia can give the infection to her baby during delivery, potentially causing serious health problems for the baby.

Men:

Men can be asymptomatic carriers.

Symptoms, if present, may include penile discharge, painful urination and – in some cases – swollen testicles.

Chlamydia can also infect the rectum of men or women. While these infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause rectal pain, discharge and/or bleeding.

Doesn’t the DOD require routine STI screenings for chlamydia?

The DOD does require annual chlamydia testing, which often includes a panel of tests for other STIs such as gonorrhea and syphilis, but the testing is only required for women under 25 years of age. This practice is based on U.S. Preventive Medicine Task Force recommendations, which don’t include routine screening for men since the most serious effects of STIs impact women. The higher rate of chlamydia among women may reflect higher rates of required testing.

Since most male service members do not voluntarily seek STI testing unless they or their partner is experiencing symptoms, they may unknowingly be spreading STI infections, such as chlamydia, to others.

What do I do if I think I might have chlamydia?

See your health care provider if you notice any of the symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one.

Cases may also be more likely to be detected among soldiers because they tend to have more health care access and required STI screening tests than the general population.

Can chlamydia be treated?

Chlamydia is easily detected and treated with antibiotics.

With proper treatment, the infection should resolve within one to two weeks; however, testing may still show positive results for up to four weeks.

Recovery doesn’t mean a person can’t be re-infected, however. A negative test doesn’t mean a future infection won’t develop if a person is exposed to an infected partner again. Since concerns about antibiotic resistance are increasing, especially after repeated treatments, it’s very important to practice safe sex to avoid infections in the first place.

But when in doubt – get tested for treatment before your health is permanently damaged.

The contract awards a total of $30.3 billion over the next 10 years, including a small business component of $1.3 billion.

The PPV program—now in its fifth iteration—includes over $2.6 billion in cost avoidance passed on to customers by leveraging capabilities of the nation’s largest prime vendors, said Catherine Gilbert, Medical contracting officer.

“The contract provides worldwide support to Defense Health Agency, Department of Defense customers, the United States Coast Guard, designated providers, other government agencies, and the US Naval Fleet,” Gilbert said. “[DLA] uses the prime vendor model, a standard commercial practice, to provide pharmaceuticals to military treatment facilities such as hospitals and pharmacies.”

The supply chain utilizing private sector business models can be a benefit to Medical’s customers.

“Mirroring commercial practices through a firm- fixed price requirements contract will result in increased supply efficiencies and return the lowest price to the customer.” Gilbert said.

“It starts with a contractual agreement between the government and the prime vendors who buy inventory from a variety of sources, stores them in commercial warehouses, and ships directly to the customer.”

The PPV Gen V expands DLA’s capabilities to meet new and emerging pharmaceutical customer needs.

“Pharmaceutical items identified as “specialty” have grown significantly over the last few years,” Gilbert said. “These types of drugs are generally higher in dollar value, require monitoring, and are largely for more targeted therapies such as chemotherapy. The industry has shown that specialty drugs need to be distributed differently, and the pricing model must be adjusted accordingly to align with commercial practices. This generation of the PPV program has evolved alongside the pharmaceutical marketplace.”

The contract includes planned and unplanned direct support to the military, said Andrea Del Collo, Medical lead commodity support liaison.

“In addition to normal day-to-day operations, the program supports readiness, which is the rapid acquisition of pharmaceutical requirements to respond to contingency operations for pre-planned and emergent disaster relief,” said Del Collo.

Republican lawmakers are considering billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid. But a new report finds those spending cuts might impact health-care coverage for thousands of Maryland military families.

The report by the Georgetown Center for Children and Families finds more than 850,000 people enrolled in Medicaid have military health insurance, known as TRICARE, as their primary coverage. One in 10 children of service members with TRICARE is also enrolled in Medicaid.

Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said Medicaid is important for service members with children who require more intensive health care.

""The TRICARE benefit package just isn't enough, so Medicaid is making TRICARE work for those families by covering the high cost of services and some benefits that those children otherwise would not have access to,"" Alker explained.

Republicans in Congress are trying to reel in what they view as out-of-control spending by $2 trillion in the next budget. But cuts to Medicaid are not universally agreed upon among Republican lawmakers.

Medicaid also serves 40 percent of children in the U.S. with a benefit that allows them to receive preventive and ameliorative care. That benefit began after a military report in the 1960s found young men were not qualified for military service in Vietnam because of preventive medical issues during their childhoods.

Retired Army Brigadier General George Schwartz said Medicaid cuts could have a negative impact on recruiting numbers as well. If troops lack proper coverage for their families, he thinks they may seek other career paths that can provide that coverage.

""As those young people reach the age where they're eligible for military service, the military is competing with private industry and all sorts of organizations for these young people. From a mission readiness point, this is a matter of national security,"" Schwartz contended.

As a leader, you play a critical role in maintaining the well-being and readiness of your service members. An often-overlooked aspect of a service member's mental and emotional health is their relationship with gambling. While many gamble casually, excessive gambling can have consequences, including financial difficulties, relationship problems and decreased job performance.

The changing face of gambling

Access to gambling has evolved. No longer confined to the gaming halls of the past, it’s now available 24/7 via personal computers and smartphones. A recent review of gambling and problematic gambling published in the August 2024 journal of public health, The Lancet, estimated the amount of money lost to gambling worldwide in 2025 will be nearly $531 billion.

Moreover, The Lancet study also found that 46% of adults and 18% of adolescents have gambled within the last 12 months. A January 2024 study conducted by the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services found that nearly 70% of its residents acknowledged gambling in the past year, with 10.7% gambling online and 10.2% betting on sports. In Department of Defense studies conducted over the past 30 years, 6.3-7.1% of service members reported having at least one gambling issue.

The Impact of Excessive Gambling on Military Service Members

Excessive gambling, also known as problem gambling, is a pattern of behavior that can lead to significant distress and impairment in daily life.

The military lifestyle can lead some service members to be inclined to excessive gambling. Some of those factors include:

• Using gambling to relieve periods of stress and anxiousness

• Turning to gambling to combat boredom, such as during extended periods of “hurry-up and wait”

• Easy access to online betting platforms and, in some duty locations, gaming facilities

• Social pressures from peers, especially while viewing sporting events

• Limited financial literacy and budgeting skills

Excessive gambling can have serious consequences for service members, including:

• Financial difficulties, such as debt and bankruptcy

• Relationship problems, including marital issues and estrangement from family and friends

• Decreased job performance and reduced readiness

• Increased risk of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety

• Risk of increased alcohol, tobacco and substance abuse

• Disruptions to unit cohesion and morale

Warning Signs of Excessive Gambling

Early identification is critical in addressing excessive gambling. Leaders play a key role in identifying those struggling with this issue. Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:

• Changes in behavior, such as increased irritability or mood swings

• Concerns or difficulties with paying bills or debts on time

• Frequent borrowing or requests for financial assistance

• Unexplained absences or tardiness

• Decreased participation in unit activities or social events

• Social media posts or conversations suggesting excessive gaming or betting

Strategies for Leader Support for Service Members who may be having gambling issues

Leaders need to take steps to identify and support service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

• Maintain an open-door policy: Encourage service members to come forward and discuss their concerns or struggles with excessive gambling

• Foster a supportive unit culture: Promote open communication to help reduce stigma around mental health concerns, including excessive gambling

• Promote peer support: Enable mentorship programs to help foster a culture of trust and provide a responsive support network

• Conduct regular unit assessments: Consistently assess unit cohesion and morale to identify potential issues, including those related to excessive gambling

• Identify and support the use of financial education and resources: Ensure service members know the base or installation services that offer budgeting and money management training

• Ensure access to counseling and support services: Make service members aware of, and facilitate access to, available services, including substance abuse treatment programs and financial counseling

• Develop a policy on excessive gambling: Mirror existing unit policies or develop a policy on excessive gambling and betting, including consequences for excessive behavior

• Maintain regular performance evaluations: Discuss any potential personal issues, such as excessive gaming or betting, as part of regular performance evaluations

• Stay informed: Keep up to date on the latest research and trends related to excessive gambling by military service members

Conclusion

Excessive gambling is a serious issue that can lead to significant consequences for service members. Leaders are critical in identifying and supporting service members struggling with this issue. By maintaining an open-door policy, conducting regular unit assessments, and providing financial education and resources, military leaders can help service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

Remember, early identification and support are key in addressing excessive gambling. Working together can help service members overcome this issue and maintain their overall well-being and readiness.

""The program is individualized to the nurses,” McNeal said.

I am proud to be a part of this team and to contribute to the development of the next generation of Army nurse leaders.","Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii — A group of six U.S. Army Nurses took the stage in Tripler Army Medical Center’s Kyser Auditorium on April 25, celebrating their completion of the hospital’s Clinical Nurse Transition Program.

Across the Military Health System, hospitals and clinics depend on highly skilled, well-trained nurses to provide high-quality patient care to active duty service members, veterans, and their families. Tripler’s CNTP is one of the programs that trains these nurses.

""These are new grads who have never worked as a registered nurse and are coming to us from the Basic Officer Leadership Course,” said Tina McNeal, director of TAMC’s CNTP program. “It's our job to show they are competent and confident nurses. With guidance from qualified preceptors, we provide a safe and supportive environment for nurses and patients, prioritizing patient safety and nurse development.""

The CNTP, which falls under Tripler’s Directorate of Health and Education Training, is an accelerated program designed to cultivate new Army nurses by transitioning them from academics to clinical practice while also developing the leadership skills and competencies necessary to excel as an Army officer.

New nurses begin the program with a 45-day orientation and onboarding phase. The next 12 weeks of CNTP are dedicated to one-to-one precepted time. Each new nurse is paired with an experienced and qualified preceptor, and the precepted time is tailored to each nurse's needs. Experienced preceptors provide individualized guidance and feedback.

""The program is individualized to the nurses,” McNeal said. “Some of the nurses come in with experience or enlistee experience. Some of the nurses might progress quicker than 12 weeks. There's an evaluation tool that preceptors use to track progress against benchmarks. Our program isn't prescriptive. If a nurse isn't meeting benchmarks, that's okay. We create a plan that supports nurses who need extra time.""

One of the successes of TAMC's CNTP program was revamping their evidence-based practice requirement, condensing it from six months to a two-day workshop at the end of precepted time. This change allowed nurses to collaborate, develop projects, and present to leaders, resulting in a more engaging and practical experience. The success of this approach led to its adoption as a recommended model for all CNTP sites, demonstrating the impact of TAMC’s innovative solution.

""They are standing up in their dress uniforms in front of the Chief Nursing Officer, Deputy Commander of Surgical Services, and other deputy lane section chiefs, and presenting a professional presentation.” McNeal said. “That's a huge success.”

One of the elements that sets TAMC's program apart is a sponsorship program, connecting participants with clinical learning, personalized support, and communication that begins before participants even arrive in Hawaii. This proactive approach helps new nurses navigate the unique challenges of military life, ensuring a smooth transition and reducing anxiety about the unknowns of Army culture, protocols, and expectations.

“We provide personalized support 30-plus days before arrival, including airport pickup, hotel accommodations, and resource coordination,” said Maj. Daniel J. Hines, assistant director of the program. ""Our goal is to immerse them in Tripler's culture and Army life, ensuring a smooth onboarding, which often includes relocation, deployment, benefits, and managing money.""

The program intentionally fosters community and teamwork among new Army nurses, recognizing that isolation can be challenging. By encouraging volunteer work, social events, and team-building activities, such as participating in marathons and celebrating the Army Nurse Corps Birthday, nurses develop essential networking skills and learn to rely on each other.

Program participants also devote a significant amount of time to volunteer work. The recent cohort volunteered more than 200 hours in the past eight months, with many members pursuing the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal. The cohort earned first place in this year’s TAMC Safety Video campaign, lead unit physical trainings, and were key participants in the Army Nurse Corps Birthday celebration. This group participated in Initial Combat Training and Leader Development, which help increase the overall numbers for the Combat Medical Specialist role within the Army.

The cohort also participates in volunteer work supporting the greater Oahu community. Teams provided medical support for the last three Honolulu Marathons. They also participated in a project to restore the ecosystem of Honolulu’s Ala Wai Canal, creating nearly 1,000 Genki Balls — mud balls filled with microorganisms that digest sludge and act as a “probiotic” for the environment.

“We are putting them in situations where they must lean on each other,” Hines said. “This approach helps to identify emerging leaders and creates a cohesive unit that can work together seamlessly, even in high-pressure situations like a code on the floor.”

The program’s success is a testament to the dedication and passion of its leaders.

“With her unwavering commitment to excellence, she has maintained an elevated standard, even in the face of changing military landscapes,” Hines said, “Her tireless efforts have created a program that not only produces exceptional nurses but also fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among its participants.”

Having personally experienced the struggles of transitioning into clinical practice as a new nurse, McNeal knows firsthand the challenges that can come with being thrown into a high-stakes environment without adequate support. Her own difficult transition, which nearly led her to leave the profession, has fueled her passion for creating a better experience for others.

McNeal has dedicated herself to developing a comprehensive and supportive program that sets them up for success, rather than leaving them to navigate the complexities of clinical practice alone.

“I do love it, so it makes it easy,” McNeal said. “I do love the job! I am proud to be a part of this team and to contribute to the development of the next generation of Army nurse leaders. That’s why I love it.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9021860/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-08 17:56:38.455827

The session, led Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and Acting Director of Defense Health Agency Dr. David Smith, highlighted how each service is tackling the evolving demands of warfighting while working together to transform military medicine.

The forum brought together “the leaders who are in the forefront of military medicine, and are visionaries who have dedicated their careers to safeguarding the health, readiness, and resilience of our service members,” said Smith.

In a time of new emerging global threats, emerging medical challenges and technological advancements, Smith said, “Their collaboration and shared expertise has never been more important and critical,” referring to the surgeons.

Service-Specific Readiness Challenges and Initiatives

U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, highlighted the U.S. Army's focus on continuous transformation and partnerships, emphasizing the integration of medics into formations and the importance of local, organizational, and international collaborations. She stressed learning from past successes and from current partners like Ukraine.

U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force surgeon general, discussed the changing role of medics, emphasizing the need for agile combat employment and redesigned training and equipment. He stressed the interconnectedness of healthcare delivery and readiness. DeGoes said the future hinges on combat-ready medics who can operate in “complex, contested environments,” and noted the service has restructured how medics are embedded into operational squadrons.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Darin Via, U.S. Navy surgeon general, focused on total sailor readiness and the conflict between generating readiness at high-volume medical centers and meeting the needs of geographically dispersed units. He highlighted innovative partnerships with civilian trauma centers and the development of an enterprise approach to integrate fleet needs into health service governance. Via emphasized building “total sailor readiness,” including mind, body and spirit. That includes leveraging partnerships with local trauma centers, where medics train in high-volume, high-acuity settings.

U.S. Marine Corps Rear Adm. Pamela Miller, medical officer of the Marine Corps, and deputy chief of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Reserve Policy and Integration, discussed the parallel transformation of health services alongside Force Design 2030, emphasizing prolonged casualty care, blood supply in dispersed environments, and joint force training. She stressed the importance of building trust with Marines through consistent, high-quality care. “Our corpsmen are going to be at the pointy end of the spear,” Miller said. “We’re asking them to do more with less, and to be ready for something even our most senior leaders haven’t seen in decades.”

U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Lisa Hou, director, Office of the Joint Surgeon General, U.S. National Guard Bureau, outlined the unique challenges of the U.S. National Guard's dual mission of warfighting and homeland defense, emphasizing the need for more time and resources for training, particularly in trauma care. She discussed partnerships with civilian hospitals and the state partnership program. For the U.S. National Guard, which forms 20% of the joint force on 4% of the Department of Defense’s budget, the challenge is time and access, Hou said, She also noted that funding and licensing barriers may hold the service back.

U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. John Andrus, U.S. Joint Staff surgeon, emphasized the need for joint qualification pathways for medics, integrated governance, normalization of processes, and enterprise management. He highlighted the importance of global integration and interoperability. He said the MHS and services need to be continually enhancing. “If we are not undergoing change, we are not growing. We are not learning, we are not adapting, we are not becoming better, and that change is really important,” said Andrus.

Despite challenges with staffing, funding and access, all leaders agreed: Readiness requires integration—across services, with civilian partners, and with allies around the world.

Via concluded by asking those who wear the uniform to “find problems, fix problems, or elevate problems, and fail fast and run with scissors.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9008057.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-08 17:56:43.726818

Serfass explained that after military service, he chose to become a therapist when he witnessed firsthand the shortage of mental health resources for soldiers.
""Most of our clients have trauma — many with military sexual trauma,"" Harris said.
The VA can't handle them all if they don't have support from the civilian mental health side.""
I give the service, and then we are paid for that service,"" Harris said.","KILLEEN, Texas — Mental health providers treating military personnel and their families across Central Texas are facing a financial crisis that threatens to leave thousands without critical care.

Since January 1, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as TRICARE's contractor for Texas and five other states, providers report going unpaid for services, some for as long as four months.

At Restorative Hope Sanctuary in Temple, therapists Kevin Serfass and Joanne Harris have been covering business expenses out of their own pockets while continuing to treat their 269 clients, approximately 80% of whom use TRICARE.

""Rather than turn away the clients, we've been sustaining our finances, but we're at the fourth month and we can't anymore,"" said Serfass, a retired military veteran who specializes in trauma treatment. ""They owe us over $70,000.""

Serfass explained that after military service, he chose to become a therapist when he witnessed firsthand the shortage of mental health resources for soldiers.

""I had a bunch of soldiers who had just returned from a rotation. Some of them were on their second or third rotation downrange,"" Serfass said. ""I could tell they were having problems. I was trying to get them in to see therapists, and it came to my awareness that we were lucky if we could get them in once or twice a month because there was such a shortage in the area.""

Harris, who has served the military community for over 20 years, emphasized the impact closure would have on patients dealing with trauma.

""Most of our clients have trauma — many with military sexual trauma,"" Harris said. ""If I were to stop seeing them, that whole group of women would have to start their trauma over with someone else. And they probably won't go back because many of them didn't even say anything about it until they came and sat with me.""

The payment issues appear to stem from technical failures in TriWest's new system. Providers across the region have reported similar problems — spending hours on hold with customer service, receiving inconsistent answers, and having no clear timeline for resolution.

""Our billing individual has gone to bat with us repeatedly,"" Serfass explained. ""They've told her 'Yes, all your claims are filed and we're good,' and she'll call back two days later and get another person to say there've been no claims filed, like they were gone.""

The crisis extends beyond mental health to physical therapy and other medical providers across Texas, Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin — all states where TriWest recently took over as TRICARE's contractor.

Serfass points out broader implications for military healthcare access.

""The reason that we exist and work in conjunction with TRICARE and the VA is because the VA cannot support the sheer numbers,"" Serfass said. ""We were at war in Iraq for 9 years, in Afghanistan for 19 years. The VA can't handle them all if they don't have support from the civilian mental health side.""

Words aren't enough for providers like Serfass and Harris, who have contacted congressional representatives seeking intervention.

""We have a contract. I give the service, and then we are paid for that service,"" Harris said. ""If I don't do what I'm supposed to, I'm penalized. But where's the penalty to them?""

Despite the financial strain, Serfass and Harris remain committed to their patients.

""We will not change our care until we receive the eviction notice and have to leave,"" Serfass said. ""That's the only way they'll get us out of here.""

Serfass says even if evicted, he'll continue finding ways to treat his clients.

""I'll probably rent an office for $300 to $400. I'll put a bucket at the door, and I'll still work with my clients and treat them and say 'Drop $20 or $40 in it on the way out.' That's the best I can do.""

In a statement to 6 News, a TriWest Healthcare Alliance spokesperson said: ""We recognize that any provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion, or any beneficiary who has an issue accessing behavioral health services, is one too many. We are deeply committed to Killeen and Fort Hood's providers and military families. We won't rest until our military community and network of providers experience the excellent standard of service TriWest is capable of and committed to delivering.""",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KCEN/images/afbab638-be46-4605-85c4-22ed7cce0bc6/20250507T220453/afbab638-be46-4605-85c4-22ed7cce0bc6_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-07 19:56:19.417941

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit's allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

The announcement was made by Brighton Marine CEO Rosye B. Cloud at an event honoring longtime employee Derrick Hassell, who has served Brighton’s Veterans and the broader community for over 47 years, by renaming its first Veterans Housing Building in his honor.

""Today, we honor an employee that embodies our values and demonstrates care and dignity to every resident and health plan beneficiary we serve,"" said Cloud.

The commitment is part of Brighton Marine’s Vision 2030 initiative, which was originally announced at the 2024 National Coalition for Homeless Veterans conference. The funds will be used to support:

Brighton Marine’s master leasing program in Massachusetts, which makes affordable housing more accessible to Veterans and their families who might not qualify for other housing programs.

Emergency assistance through Brighton Marine’s Empowerment Fund, which provides emergency funding to help prevent eviction or financial distress that could lead to homelessness.

The establishment of a prevention hub in Washington, D.C. to serve as an incubator for innovative programs and ideas that can help address Veteran homelessness and housing insecurity nationwide.

According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, as of December 2024 there were 550 Veterans experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts.

This week, we honor the strength and dedication of the extraordinary professionals who serve both our country and warfighters with unwavering courage. Whether they are on the frontlines, in field hospitals or at military medical centers around the world, their commitment to care under the most challenging conditions inspires us all.

The Power of Nurses

Nurses are a powerful force for many reasons. They advocate for their patients, they take on multiple roles to deliver care, and they break barriers to work across disciplines and teams—always keeping the patient front and center.

Roughly 30 million people around the world—including our active duty service members of all ranks, National Guard and Reserve members, civilians and contractors—dedicate their lives to nursing. Just over 17,000 nurses, military and civilian, serve every day across the globe in our military health system. Even after decades of serving as a nurse myself, I am still inspired by their resilience, depth of knowledge, and steadfast commitment to advancing the health of others.

Nurses Advocate for their Patients

One of the many ways nurses support our health is by constantly advocating for patients. Whether they are talking to a new Marine who has questions about her medications or is struggling to make an appointment, or a veteran who needs a compassionate ear to talk through his diagnosis that he may not fully understand, nurses keep our best interest at heart and calmly guide us through often difficult and uncharted territory.

One such nurse is Bianca Rodriguez, a breast nurse navigator at Brooke Army Medical Center. She arranges surgery, acts as a go-between for the patient and his or her provider, and helps to arrange transportation to and from appointments.

Nurses like Rodriguez support each and every one of us with compassionate care from the moment we arrive at a healthcare facility, to the moment we leave and during recovery. They heal not only physical wounds but can build trust to mend internal, personal challenges that often remain hidden from the outside world.

Nurses Care for Patients through Multiple Roles

Nurses all around the world serve many different roles, both in and outside of health care. In addition to patient care and clinical roles they also serve in research labs and classrooms as educators and mentors, evaluate data to improve patient care systems, and lead the optimization of the Defense Health Agency.

With their expertise and knowledge, nurses often respond to emergencies when they are least expected. In April, U.S. Army Maj. Joshua Goldberg, the Department of Education chief at Evans Army Community Hospital, with the help of his wife, Kaylanda Pinkerton, the chief nurse for the Mountain Post Birthing Center, was recognized with the Soldier’s Medal for heroism during a crisis. When gunshots rang out near their son’s football game, they immediately sprang into action. They rushed to the parking lot where they found a victim with multiple gunshot wounds. Without hesitation, Goldberg immediately began CPR until the paramedics arrived. This is just one example that shows the readiness of our nurses to act in the interest of others at a moment’s notice.

Nurses Wield an Inspirational Power to Collaborate

When I joined the United States Public Health Service, one of the first things I noticed was the unique power of nurses to collaborate across disciplines. It’s truly an art. Transcending traditional boundary, nurses will stop at nothing to ensure patients receive the utmost care when they need it.

I saw this firsthand last month when I visited military hospitals and clinics in Japan. There, supply chains face lengthy logistical hurdles, with the procurement of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment requiring more extensive lead time compared to stateside facilities. What struck me most during my visit was the team's collaboration to overcome these challenges. Not only have the medical staff within the military hospitals and clinics successfully built relationships within the Japanese healthcare system, but they also work with U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army medical personnel to provide seamless care. This collaboration led to partnerships between the joint neonatal intensive care unit operations and related evacuations between the United States Naval Hospital Okinawa-Japan and the Naval Hospital Yokosuka.

I am not the only one who noticed the team’s innovation and collaboration; the hospitals’ compassionate and innovative nurses received a DAISY Award—an internationally recognized professional award that celebrates nurses who have made profound differences in the lives of others.

Lean-in with Thought and Curiosity, and Do Not be Shy

We are in a dynamic moment in history. With lessons-learned from deployments domestically and internationally, new artificial intelligence tools to deliver optimized health care, and an ever-changing digital landscape streamlining our processes, we have an opportunity to lean-in with thought and curiosity. To my fellow nurses: Do not be shy. Even in times of uncertainty, situations that may seem uncomfortable are not designed to frustrate us; they are designed to help us grow.

Our shared responsibility to support the warfighter has never been more critical. From providing care in the Pacific Northwest to the most remote regions of the Indo-Pacific, our responsibility to support, strengthen, and sustain our warfighters’ health and readiness to fight knows no boundaries. We must remain ready to act and continue to provide the highest-quality care whenever and wherever we are needed.

One of our goals as nurses is to create a world where good health is in the reach of every person. By building on the core power of patient advocacy, unwavering care, and collaboration engrained in our craft by those who came before us, I am confident that we will reach our goal.

To all nurses and their families around the world, thank you.

More About Brighton Marine Brighton Marine was founded in 1983 in Brighton, MA.","BRIGHTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Brighton Marine, a nonprofit operating the US Family Health Plan of Southern New England, a Tricare Prime health plan, in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, announced its intention to expand its existing housing and programming services by investing $10 million over the next five years in programs to prevent and end Veteran homelessness.

The announcement was made by Brighton Marine CEO Rosye B. Cloud at an event honoring longtime employee Derrick Hassell, who has served Brighton’s Veterans and the broader community for over 47 years, by renaming its first Veterans Housing Building in his honor.

“Today, we honor an employee that embodies our values and demonstrates care and dignity to every resident and health plan beneficiary we serve,” said Cloud. “The resources we will invest over the next five years will help prevent housing insecurity and address the immediate needs of Veterans experiencing homelessness.”

The commitment is part of Brighton Marine’s Vision 2030 initiative, which was originally announced at the 2024 National Coalition for Homeless Veterans conference. The funds will be used to support:

Brighton Marine’s master leasing program in Massachusetts, which makes affordable housing more accessible to Veterans and their families who might not qualify for other housing programs.

Emergency assistance through Brighton Marine’s Empowerment Fund, which provides emergency funding to help prevent eviction or financial distress that could lead to homelessness.

The establishment of a prevention hub in Washington, D.C. to serve as an incubator for innovative programs and ideas that can help address Veteran homelessness and housing insecurity nationwide.

""No veteran should ever be without a safe, stable place to call home or the services that they need,” said Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, who also spoke at the event. “That's why in Massachusetts, we have prioritized ending Veteran homelessness for good and expanding resources and services for our heroes.

""Brighton Marine has long understood that housing is health care,” said Massachusetts Veterans Services Secretary Jon Santiago. “This bold investment, made possible through the US Family Health Plan, reflects a deep commitment to meeting veterans where they are—with flexible, innovative solutions that address both immediate needs and long-term stability. It’s exactly the kind of partnership that aligns with our End Veteran Homelessness campaign and our broader goal of making veteran homelessness rare, brief, and nonrecurring.""

Supported by its innovative social enterprise business model, Brighton Marine is investing in prevention programs and resources that stop homelessness before it starts and improves long-term health outcomes for Veterans. They partner with the federal government, state and local leaders, and other community organizations to further their mission to provide healthcare, housing and hope to Veterans and their families.

More About Brighton Marine

Brighton Marine was founded in 1983 in Brighton, MA. when the federal government decided to close many hospitals within the public hospital system, including the Brighton Marine hospital, which provided vital healthcare needs to local veterans. The organization, which eventually became Brighton Marine, was then called the Allston-Brighton Aid and Health Group.

Today, Brighton Marine continues through its core programs and services:

Healthcare: Brighton Marine operates the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan of Southern New England and its Brighton campus is home to 10 community health organizations which collectively serve over 15,000 Veterans, active-duty service members and their families.

Housing: Brighton Marine campus provides affordable housing on campus through The Residences, a six-story multi-family housing complex built in 2020 with more than 100 units of affordable housing with preference to Veterans and their families and the newly re-named Derrick Hassell Veterans Living community. In 2025 it will also launch a master leasing initiative in Massachusetts.

Financial Support: Brighton Marine’s Empowerment Fund was endowed in 2015 to help Veterans with costs associated with obtaining housing such as providing security deposits, clearing past utility debt, and covering application and broker fees that are often not covered by programs like the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) program.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250507811880/en/2322173/22/BMILogo.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-07 13:56:39.830838

Two symposium presentations spotlighted DHA R&D-MRDC’s unique capabilities for rapidly commercializing new military medical products to ensure they can be used effectively to help Warfighters maintain their operational effectiveness when operating in chemically and biologically compromised environments.

The first presentation featured Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics Branch at DHA R&D-MRDC’s Office of Regulated Activities, discussing how ORA’s regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals guide regulated medical products through the rigorous review process required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before they can be considered safe for use by humans. ORA specializes in identifying and mitigating risks early in the product development life cycle, which accelerates the delivery of lifesaving drugs, biologics, medical devices, and combination products to the Warfighter.

“The labs within DHA R&D-MRDC focus on a wide variety of portfolios, anywhere from simple bandages to high-risk medical devices, and our responsibility is to provide the risk mitigation to those product development efforts across the enterprise,” explained Thakur, DHA R&D-MRDC’s 2025 Employee of the Year. “We are a unique capability within the DOD, and we can work with anyone as long as they have some sort of DOD connection.”

The second presentation, by Amanda Corbel, the mid-Atlantic regional coordinator for the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer, focused on the important role that disseminating intellectual property plays in getting life-saving military medical products into the field quickly and cost-effectively. DHA R&D-MRDC’s Office of Medical Technology Transfer works with inventors throughout the DOD to identify sources of funding, address regulatory and licensing requirements, find facilities that can develop and test prototypes, and even assist with sales and marketing of their products, helping to ensure that the inventions will be mature, de-risked, and ready for manufacture – significantly improving their value to potential licensors.

Dr. Yun-Xing Wang, a structural biologist at the National Cancer Institute, gave the keynote address at this year’s event. His presentation, “Why RNA is Fun and More Interesting but Challenging to Study --- A Structural Biologist’s Point of View,” discussed the latest research being conducted at NCI in support of the development of RNA-based therapies that may someday be used to treat deadly cancers in Service Members, helping improve their fitness and readiness.

The Capt. Jennifer J. Shafer Odom Fitness Center hosted vendor booths for 39 military medical companies, organizations, and professional associations, as well as 95 poster exhibits showcasing advanced research recently completed or currently underway by researchers representing the spectrum of military medicine research and development. Fort Detrick’s Community Activities Center featured education sessions presented by event sponsors as well as the popular Young Investigator Symposium and “poster blitz” session, at which early career researchers practiced their oral presentation skills before a panel of judges.

The session, led Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and Acting Director of Defense Health Agency Dr. David Smith, highlighted how each service is tackling the evolving demands of warfighting while working together to transform military medicine.

The forum brought together “the leaders who are in the forefront of military medicine, and are visionaries who have dedicated their careers to safeguarding the health, readiness, and resilience of our service members,” said Smith.

In a time of new emerging global threats, emerging medical challenges and technological advancements, Smith said, “Their collaboration and shared expertise has never been more important and critical,” referring to the surgeons.

Service-Specific Readiness Challenges and Initiatives

• U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, highlighted the U.S. Army's focus on continuous transformation and partnerships, emphasizing the integration of medics into formations and the importance of local, organizational, and international collaborations. She stressed learning from past successes and from current partners like Ukraine.

• U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force surgeon general, discussed the changing role of medics, emphasizing the need for agile combat employment and redesigned training and equipment. He stressed the interconnectedness of healthcare delivery and readiness.

DeGoes said the future hinges on combat-ready medics who can operate in “complex, contested environments,” and noted the service has restructured how medics are embedded into operational squadrons.

• U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Darin Via, U.S. Navy surgeon general, focused on total sailor readiness and the conflict between generating readiness at high-volume medical centers and meeting the needs of geographically dispersed units. He highlighted innovative partnerships with civilian trauma centers and the development of an enterprise approach to integrate fleet needs into health service governance.

Via emphasized building “total sailor readiness,” including mind, body and spirit. That includes leveraging partnerships with local trauma centers, where medics train in high-volume, high-acuity settings.

• U.S. Marine Corps Rear Adm. Pamela Miller, medical officer of the Marine Corps, and deputy chief of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Reserve Policy and Integration, discussed the parallel transformation of health services alongside Force Design 2030, emphasizing prolonged casualty care, blood supply in dispersed environments, and joint force training. She stressed the importance of building trust with Marines through consistent, high-quality care.

“Our corpsmen are going to be at the pointy end of the spear,” Miller said. “We’re asking them to do more with less, and to be ready for something even our most senior leaders haven’t seen in decades.”

• U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Lisa Hou, director, Office of the Joint Surgeon General, U.S. National Guard Bureau, outlined the unique challenges of the U.S. National Guard's dual mission of warfighting and homeland defense, emphasizing the need for more time and resources for training, particularly in trauma care. She discussed partnerships with civilian hospitals and the state partnership program.

For the U.S. National Guard, which forms 20% of the joint force on 4% of the Department of Defense’s budget, the challenge is time and access, Hou said, She also noted that funding and licensing barriers may hold the service back.

• U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. John Andrus, U.S. Joint Staff surgeon, emphasized the need for joint qualification pathways for medics, integrated governance, normalization of processes, and enterprise management. He highlighted the importance of global integration and interoperability.

He said the MHS and services need to be continually enhancing. “If we are not undergoing change, we are not growing. We are not learning, we are not adapting, we are not becoming better, and that change is really important,” said Andrus.

Despite challenges with staffing, funding and access, all leaders agreed: Readiness requires integration—across services, with civilian partners, and with allies around the world.

Via concluded by asking those who wear the uniform to “find problems, fix problems, or elevate problems, and fail fast and run with scissors.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9008057/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-07 10:56:40.398919

“Answering the call to serve often means making a great number of sacrifices for your country,” Strickland said.
This bill removes current barriers in TRICARE and helps ensure that all service members can access the fertility care they deserve to start a family.” Barbara Collura, president and chief executive officer of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said the country’s servicemembers deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families, including in vitro fertilization.
""The ‘Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act’ is a critical piece of legislation,” said Karla Torres, senior human rights counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights.
“By removing legal barriers that currently exclude from insurance coverage servicemembers whose infertility is not directly service-related, and safeguarding against discrimination in coverage of this care, the Act gets us closer to ensuring that all servicemembers and their dependents can have equitable and non-discriminatory access to the fertility health care they need to build their families.""","On April 24, during National Infertility Awareness Week, Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland, D-Tacoma, led the reintroduction of the “Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act.”

The bill would expand TRICARE coverage to make assisted reproductive services, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), available to all active duty service members, including National Guard and reserve members, as well as their dependents — regardless of service-connection requirements, sex, gender, sexual orientation or marital status.

The act has been endorsed by RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Modern Military Association of America.

“Answering the call to serve often means making a great number of sacrifices for your country,” Strickland said. “Being able to start a family should not be one of them. This bill removes current barriers in TRICARE and helps ensure that all service members can access the fertility care they deserve to start a family.”

Barbara Collura, president and chief executive officer of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said the country’s servicemembers deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families, including in vitro fertilization. Collura said 85 percent of Americans support access to IVF, calling it “one of the most effective medical treatments for those struggling to build their family.”

“Expanding TRICARE coverage to include IVF and fertility care is not just the right thing to do — it’s a critical investment in the health and wellbeing of military families,” Collura said. “RESOLVE stands strongly in support of this long-overdue change, and we urge Congress to act swiftly to ensure that no one who serves our country is denied the chance to become a parent.”

Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for ASRM, thanked Strickland, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Rep. Mark Takano and Rep. Ayanna Pressley for “calling attention to the fact that current Department of Defense (DOD) policy — which limits TRICARE coverage for fertility treatments to only service members with a service-connected illness or injury — fails to provide our military families with adequate access to care.”

“It’s about time we address this shortcoming so that our brave men and women in uniform do not have to juggle the out-of-pocket costs for treatment with their service, end their military careers to access health care, or forego their dreams of having a family,” Tipton said.

""The ‘Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act’ is a critical piece of legislation,” said Karla Torres, senior human rights counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights. “By removing legal barriers that currently exclude from insurance coverage servicemembers whose infertility is not directly service-related, and safeguarding against discrimination in coverage of this care, the Act gets us closer to ensuring that all servicemembers and their dependents can have equitable and non-discriminatory access to the fertility health care they need to build their families.""",https://cdn3.creativecirclemedia.com/lafromboise/original/20250506-173323-208-strickland-home-mobile-hero.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-07 10:56:45.449596

(NASDAQ:ZYXI) is facing a double whammy linked to its dealings with TriCare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military community. The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company's troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., No. 25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.), alleges that Zynex and certain top executives violated federal securities laws between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit's allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“The high grade in safety reflects the entire organization’s commitment to providing the best care possible,” said Dr. Evan Renz, BAMC deputy commander for quality and safety. “Earning the ‘A’ means that the team maintained its clear focus on high-quality and safety over an extended period of time.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections.

Leapfrog assigns an “A,” “B,” “C,” “D” or “F” grade to general hospitals across the country based on over 30 performance measures reflecting errors, accidents, injuries and infections, as well as the systems hospitals have in place to prevent them.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 16 received an “A” grade.

“The Leapfrog standards align with our commitment to the principles of Ready Reliable Care,” Renz said. “The distinction reflects not only hard work, but a longstanding culture demonstrated by thousands of BAMC staff members.”

Ready Reliable Care is the Defense Health Agency-led effort to advance high reliability across the Military Health System. Ready Reliable Care describes BAMC’s efforts to become a high reliability organization. An HRO strives for zero harm and remains committed to continuous learning and improvement, despite operating in complex or high-risk environments.

BAMC serves more than 250,000 military beneficiaries within San Antonio and the surrounding communities. On average there are about 236 inpatients daily.

Throughout his career, Malanoski has been instrumental in shaping military health care delivery, particularly during the DHA's formative years.

Malanoski’s journey began in 1973, when he joined the Navy through a Reserve Officers' Training Corps scholarship program. After graduating from Georgetown University School of Medicine, he served in various leadership positions, including as the first commanding officer of Naval Support Activity Bethesda, before retiring from active duty in 2011.

His military background instilled in him a problem-solving mindset. ""The Navy teaches you there's no such thing as a problem that doesn't have a solution. Sometimes you just run out of time,"" Malanoski said in an exit interview.

During his tenure at the DHA, Malanoski helped lead a remarkable transformation of military health care. ""What the DHA accomplished in two years is nothing short of remarkable. They stood up a headquarters while at the same time moving out on some major initiatives and change efforts in what some would see as an unachievable timeline,"" he said.

Under Malanoski's leadership, the DHA successfully transitioned from markets to networks in just eight months – a process that typically takes years in most Defense Department organizations. He credits much of this success to the DHA's organizational agility and shared core values.

Looking toward the DHA's future, Malanoski believes the agency is asking the right questions: ""What system do you want? And then we can tell you how much that will cost."" This approach, he argues, will help align resources with mission requirements.

His advice to future leaders? ""If you're looking at something and there's not a chance you can fail, it probably isn't worth doing,"" he said.

After retirement, Malanoski plans to take time for himself, driving around the country and enjoying the opportunity to reflect on a fulfilling career and consider what comes next.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/Malanoski.png,N,1.0,2025-05-07 01:56:19.170657

“STIs are estimated to be experienced by about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. every year – this includes service members.
“Because many service members who have chlamydia are unaware that they are infected, practicing safe sex and routine testing for chlamydia are essential to preventing further transmission and severe disease outcomes,” says Obuseh.
Most chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause noticeable symptoms but can still lead to serious health complications.
Women: • Even without symptoms, chlamydia can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system.","By V. Hauschild, MPH, Defense Centers for Public Health–Aberdeen Public Affairs

Sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, include both sexually transmitted diseases, known as STDs, and the many infections that don’t progress to disease. STIs are caused by more than 30 different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which are transmitted through skin-to-skin and bodily fluid contact during intimate sexual encounters.

The most commonly tracked STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. The Department of Defense has had an ongoing battle with them for decades.

“STIs are much more common than many realize,” says Francis Obuseh, a senior epidemiologist and Defense Health Agency–Public Health STI expert. “STIs are estimated to be experienced by about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. every year – this includes service members. Symptomatic infections and long-term complications can compromise service member readiness and well-being.”

Obuseh says the effects of STIs can show up days, weeks or even months after exposure in those who experience signs and/or symptoms. Before they develop symptoms, they may unknowingly pass the infection to other sexual partners.

But those who are symptomatic and seeking care don’t capture the full risk, he says.

“Especially concerning are asymptomatic STI cases, who are people who do not have symptoms but are ‘carriers’ who can still give the infection to others,” says Obuseh. “Unfortunately, many people, both men and women, fall in this asymptomatic category. Since they don’t have symptoms, these infected people typically don’t seek testing and treatment, continuing sexual activity and increasing STI spread.”

The case of chlamydia

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html) continue to show chlamydia is a significant public health concern among civilians, and military STI surveillance has indicated chlamydia rates among service members are almost two times higher than among civilian U.S. adults (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34075000/).

Current U.S. military STI surveillance reports show that rates of chlamydia declined between 2015 and 2023, but chlamydia remains the most commonly detected STI among service members (https://www.health.mil/News/Articles/2024/06/01/MSMR-STIs-2023?type=Fact+Sheets). The highest rates of chlamydia were observed in the Army and Marine Corps. Service members under 25 years of age were the most commonly infected.

According to recent DHA-PH data, the chlamydia infection rate of female service members is approximately three times higher than that of their male counterparts. However, the higher rates seen in females are thought to be mostly due to the routine testing required among young military women.

“Because many service members who have chlamydia are unaware that they are infected, practicing safe sex and routine testing for chlamydia are essential to preventing further transmission and severe disease outcomes,” says Obuseh.

Obuseh answers several common questions about chlamydia:

How can I prevent chlamydia?

The only way to completely avoid chlamydia is to abstain from vaginal, anal or oral sex. If you are sexually active, you can lower your chances of getting chlamydia by—

• Engaging in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have chlamydia.

• Using condoms the right way (https://www.cdc.gov/chlamydia/about/index.html%09/condomeffectiveness/male-condom-use.html%09https:/www.cdc.gov/condom-use/#cdc_health_safety_special_topic_how-how-to-use-condoms-and-other-barriers), consistently and correctly, every time you have sex.

How do I know if I have chlamydia, and what are the effects?

Most chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause noticeable symptoms but can still lead to serious health complications. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until several weeks after exposure.

Women:

• Even without symptoms, chlamydia can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. This can include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic (outside the womb) chronic pelvic pain, and may make getting pregnant difficult or even impossible (known as infertility). Chlamydia can also cause a potentially fatal ectopic pregnancy.

• Symptoms, if present, may include abnormal or smelly vaginal discharge, a burning sensation when urinating, and/or bleeding between periods.

• If pregnant, a woman with chlamydia can give the infection to her baby during delivery, potentially causing serious health problems for the baby.

Men:

• Men can be asymptomatic carriers.

• Symptoms, if present, may include penile discharge, painful urination and – in some cases – swollen testicles.

Chlamydia can also infect the rectum of men or women. While these infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause rectal pain, discharge and/or bleeding.

Doesn’t the DOD require routine STI screenings for chlamydia?

The DOD does require annual chlamydia testing, which often includes a panel of tests for other STIs such as gonorrhea and syphilis, but the testing is only required for women under 25 years of age. This practice is based on U.S. Preventive Medicine Task Force recommendations, which don’t include routine screening for men since the most serious effects of STIs impact women. The higher rate of chlamydia among women may reflect higher rates of required testing.

Since most male service members do not voluntarily seek STI testing unless they or their partner is experiencing symptoms, they may unknowingly be spreading STI infections, such as chlamydia, to others.

What do I do if I think I might have chlamydia?

See your health care provider if you notice any of the symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one.

Cases may also be more likely to be detected among soldiers because they tend to have more health care access and required STI screening tests than the general population.

Can chlamydia be treated?

Chlamydia is easily detected and treated with antibiotics.

With proper treatment, the infection should resolve within one to two weeks; however, testing may still show positive results for up to four weeks.

Recovery doesn’t mean a person can’t be re-infected, however. A negative test doesn’t mean a future infection won’t develop if a person is exposed to an infected partner again. Since concerns about antibiotic resistance are increasing, especially after repeated treatments, it’s very important to practice safe sex to avoid infections in the first place.

But when in doubt – get tested for treatment before your health is permanently damaged.

The digital provider increased its payer business by 33% in the first quarter of 2025.

Talkspace is now boasting its fifth profitable quarter in a row, with revenue up by 15% to $52.2 million. Payer sessions were up 23% in the first quarter of the year to 350,000 sessions.

The company is also betting on its payer strategy, insulating it from an impending recession.

“I’d like to proactively address a common question we’ve received amid recent market volatility,” John Cohen, CEO of Talkspace, said this morning in the company’s Q1 earnings call. “Our business is not directly affected by tariffs. More importantly, our long-term strategy has shifted the core of our business to an insured patient base, reducing reliance on out-of-pocket spending. As an in-network provider for nearly 200,000,000 covered lives, we remain accessible and affordable. We are a national provider of Medicare, including Medicare Advantage, and continue to benefit from the federal investment in senior mental health.”

It is also now seeing some wins from its Medicare and TRICARE bets. Last year, the company announced it would partner with Medicare to make the service in-network for beneficiaries. Thus far, the company has witnessed strong patient outcomes, with 84% of Medicare members showing clinical improvement, bypassing the 70% expectation.

In January, the company announced it was in-network with TRICARE EAST and WEST region contractors.

“Our reach into various military communities through a series of specialized grassroots efforts has been very successful and very cost-effective,” Cohen said. “To date, with significant numbers of military personnel and their family members engaging in therapy. We are seeing that this audience relies extensively on word of mouth and loyalty from recommendations within their communities, and are very open to therapy. In January, we also began to deploy initiatives to address the Medicare population, and as a result, we are seeing growth in our Medicare registration.”

DTE, DTC woes

While the company’s payer strategy appears to be thriving, its direct-to-enterprise business is stagnant. The provider reported a 3% decrease in its DTE business year over year.

Once considered a bright spot in digital behavioral health services, DTE models now face uncertainty as companies increasingly scale back EAP services amid persistent economic headwinds, according to some industry experts.

“At the employer level, as they erode economically, will they have the dollars to put into a really nice EAP service versus the most very basic EAP service?” Carney said. “So we’ve already seen the effects of that. … Employers that gave the EAP 12 visits might go down to three, or do something to help them save money. The pressure on behavioral health will be high.”

Still, Talkspace has implemented a new program that could help address any changes to EAP sessions. The provider created an “easy button” system for its EAP members to convert to their employer’s behavioral health insurance coverage when they exhaust their EAP plan sessions.

“Users are now notified when EAP sessions are running low, thus reducing friction related to checking coverage benefits and making a switch while continuing with their existing provider,” Cohen said. “This is an incredibly important step to facilitate our members’ continuation on the platform, as well as to ensure the continuity and quality of care.”

Its direct-to-consumer business also saw a 32% decline as more members used their insurance benefits at checkout.

This news comes as some of its digital competitors struggle to maintain a direct-to-consumer model. For example, Teladoc’s direct-to-consumer behavioral health platform BetterHelp reported an 11% revenue decline in Q1 of 2025.

While BetterHelp was a holdout for D2C care, last week, it announced the acquisition of digital mental health startup UpLift to grow its in-network base.",https://bhbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/08/laptop-digital-health-digital-mental-health-telehealth-virtual-care-telemedicine.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-06 15:56:25.738039

Corporate media, which have spent the years since the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision aiding Democrats’ abortion for all agenda, largely ignored the landmark study.
We wanted this to be an airtight study, because we want the FDA to replicate it,” Anderson said.
In fact, President Donald Trump’s FDA commissioner, Martin Makary, has co-authored at least five studies that relied on de-identified patient data.
The Federalist recently pressed Makary on evaluating mifepristone’s approval and safeguards and asked if he has plans to incorporate this study’s findings into his abortion pill decision-making.","The most comprehensive U.S. study of the abortion pill excluded tens of thousands of insurance claims from its analysis of mifepristone-linked complications to ensure it did not exaggerate the harms the abortion drug could inflict on women.

The exclusion of those data points further legitimizes findings that 10.9 percent of women suffered sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or other serious complications within 45 days of a chemical abortion. It also puts to bed criticisms raised by bad-faith actors who questioned researchers’ conclusions that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should reinstate mifepristone safeguards or potentially rescind its approval altogether.

Corporate media, which have spent the years since the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision aiding Democrats’ abortion for all agenda, largely ignored the landmark study. Those outlets that did mention it claimed the “bogus” findings were “junk science” that stemmed from “bad data.”

Methodology documents obtained by The Federalist, however, show 72 percent (or 98,483) of the emergency room visits represented across the Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare, Department of Veterans Affairs, and private medical insurance claims purchased for the study were excluded because they were either unrelated to the abortion pill or failed to meet the medically serious threshold outlined by the National Institutes of Health.

Ethics and Public Policy Center researchers Ryan T. Anderson and Jamie Bryan Hall told The Federalist that they were careful to exclude certain ER diagnoses such as shortness of breath, nausea with vomiting, unspecified lower abdominal pain, Covid-19 exposure, nicotine dependence, asthma, and anxiety disorder to avoid overstating the risks of mifepristone.

Also kept out of the study’s ER visit data were the number of women who sought emergency treatment for miscarriage as opposed to women whose coded insurance claims indicated an elective chemical abortion and insurance claims from women who sought hospital help for what was determined to be “typical expected bleeding” after taking mifepristone.

“We intentionally did not include those because we weren’t trying to be sloppier to cook the books or to artificially inflate the number. We wanted this to be an airtight study, because we want the FDA to replicate it,” Anderson said.

The result was a 4.7 percent rate of abortion-related ER visits that involved serious adverse events, just one-tenth of a percentage point higher than the hospital visit frequency listed on Mifeprex’s label.

Even with tens of thousands of data exclusions and an ER visit benchmark that nearly matched the abortion drug’s label, Anderson and Hall found the rate of life-threatening complications due to mifepristone is at least 22 times higher than what the FDA and the abortion pill’s manufacturer suggest.

Replicability Is Key

At least one outlet complained that the lack of peer review on EPPC’s findings rendered it unscientific. Anderson and Hall said, however, that they opted to conduct a report that could be copied by the governing U.S. drug agency, skeptics, or even pro-abortion organizations like Planned Parenthood and Guttmacher Institute over the time-consuming peer review process because “the thing that matters most is replicability and peer review doesn’t even guarantee that.”

“The reality here is the peer review process is broken,” Anderson said. “This study would have taken years to get through a peer review process, because the editors would have slow-walked it.”

Even if Anderson and Hall submitted their findings to a journal to be evaluated and approved, the long-term publication of information exposing the dangers of the nation’s most popular abortion drug regimen is not guaranteed — as seen by the contested retractions of three peer-reviewed published studies on the harms of mifepristone shortly before the U.S. Supreme Court was slated to hear arguments in a landmark mifepristone case.

To further shore up their findings against criticism, Anderson and Hall ensured the seven years’ worth of insurance claims they used to evaluate mifepristone’s effects on women were a widely accepted, legitimate source used to inform academic research. In fact, President Donald Trump’s FDA commissioner, Martin Makary, has co-authored at least five studies that relied on de-identified patient data.

What Now?

In the conclusion of their study, Anderson and Hall warned that the FDA “should immediately reinstate its earlier, stronger patient safety protocols” and “reconsider its approval altogether.”

“We fully expect that if the FDA looks into this data, they’re going to come to the same conclusions,” Anderson confirmed to The Federalist.

Makary had hinted that new data could change the agency’s trajectory. The Federalist recently pressed Makary on evaluating mifepristone’s approval and safeguards and asked if he has plans to incorporate this study’s findings into his abortion pill decision-making. An FDA spokeswoman responded, claiming that “the agency rigorously evaluates the latest scientific data, leveraging gold standard science to make informed decisions.”

“I think it would be very hard to justify them simply putting their head in the sand and ignoring this. They promised to Make America Healthy Again, and you can’t Make America Healthy Again when 11 percent of women who have a chemical abortion suffer a serious adverse event,” Anderson concluded.

Military health professionals need a broad skillset, acknowledged Woodson, which includes cross-cultural communication to address global and operational challenges.
“Developing a health care workforce relevant for the future is a complex, but essential enterprise undertaken,” Woodson stated.
“The theme was the future of military medicine: integrated, innovative, and ready.
Concluding the conference, military medical leaders expressed their ongoing commitment to providing high-quality health care to warfighters and their families.","The evolving transformation of health care and military medicine were the main focal points of plenary speeches given by Dr. Scott Steele, president of main campus at the Cleveland Clinic, Uniformed Services University President Dr. Jonathan Woodson, and Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara on the closing day of the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 1.

Steele, a physician with experience in military and civilian health care, emphasized how the MHS can improve patient outcomes through regionalization, specialization, and collaboration.

During his talk, he reflected on his leadership journey, stressing the importance of embracing challenges, effective time management, and aligning professional and personal goals through work-life integration. He encouraged the audience to write down their leadership philosophies, use coaches, and take initiative by completing tasks early and with excellence.

Steele told the audience to “embrace the problems, feel those problems, learn from those problems—because you're going to need to rely on that kind of thought process of how you work through it in order to embrace the challenges that are going to happen in the future.”

Steele concluded by urging that military and civilian healthcare leaders to rethink traditional models, prioritize quality over volume, and remain committed to delivering the highest standards of care, regardless of setting.

Developing the Military Healthcare Workforce for the Future

Woodson emphasized that as the healthcare landscape goes through a rapid transformation, the MHS needs to develop a workforce capable of meeting emerging needs in his session titled, “Developing the Healthcare Workforce for the Future: A Focus on the Military Medical Workforce.”

He noted factors shaping the future of health care include demographic shifts, evolving public interest in healthcare careers, advancements in technology, and the transition toward value-based and community oriented care.

Military health professionals need a broad skillset, acknowledged Woodson, which includes cross-cultural communication to address global and operational challenges.

“We're in charge of our destiny, and it really is a promising future as long as we think differently and act differently going forward,” he said.

Woodson recommended investing in robust and adaptable training programs, leveraging technology, fostering a culture of collaboration, prioritizing recruitment and retention, adapting regulatory practices, and promoting research and innovation.

He said technological tools such as artificial intelligence show promise in optimizing workforce deployment, and AI applications, including virtual reality training and telehealth services—particularly for veterans—offer innovative solutions to enhance efficiency, education, and access to care.

“Developing a health care workforce relevant for the future is a complex, but essential enterprise undertaken,” Woodson stated. “The evolving healthcare landscape demands a proactive, adaptive, and collaborative approach that embraces technological advancement, fosters professionalism, and prioritizes the well-being of the workforce.”

“We need to recognize the essential nature of our mission,” he stressed. “It is a no-fail mission. The important message is that looking backward is not going to make us win in the future. We must redesign, develop a new mindset in how we are going to proceed forward … the health and readiness of our nation, both at home and abroad, is in your hands.”

MHS Conference Vital to ‘Grow as an Organization’

“I think based on the success of this week's MHS conference, it helps us to know this is an absolute must-have,” said Ferrara. “We’ve got to keep this going.”

“There was just an incredible opportunity to exchange ideas, to network, to meet other people, and really to grow as an organization, as a team,” he added.

Ferrara said the conference was “moving and inspiring, and helped bring us back to the center of what the nature of our mission is all about.”

He also noted the quality of breakout sessions at the conference, adding, “We had everything from workforce well-being, interoperability, operational medicine, modernization, and others.”

Ferrara closed by sharing his confidence in the MHS.

“The theme was the future of military medicine: integrated, innovative, and ready. I hope everybody is leaving here as excited and inspired as I am,” he said. “Every time I get to interact with the people that we have, the MHS, I know that we are in great shape.”

The Office of Personnel Management said more than 33,500 federal employees retired in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 29,700 during the first three months of 2024. OPM's retirement backlog dropped to 16,700, almost 4,000 less than March. On average, OPM is processing retirement claims in 54 days, but those applications that took less than 60 days for the agency to get OPM the paperwork were processed in 33 days on average.

Lawmakers are pressing the National Labor Relations Board after a whistleblower reported a potential DOGE-related data breach. House Democrats are demanding answers from the NLRB over whether the Department of Government Efficiency affiliates exfiltrated multiple gigabytes of sensitive data from the agency. An NLRB IT specialist blew the whistle on the data incident last month. The whistleblower submitted evidence showing DOGE users may have created backdoors to remove the data. The disclosure also shows individuals in Russia attempted to use newly created DOGE accounts to access NLRB systems.

The Department of Health and Human Services faces a lawsuit from 19 states and the District of Columbia over major workforce cuts. Attorneys general say the recent firing of 10,000 HHS employees doesn’t leave the agency with the resources it needs to carry out essential programs. The lawsuit says that forces states to step in and foot the bill for work previously done by HHS. Another 10,000 employees left HHS through early retirements, separation incentives, and an offer to resign and go on paid administrative leave through the end of the fiscal year.

This year’s tax filing season is over but the IRS is setting mandatory weekend overtime hours for some employees. Some IRS employees will have to work eight hours of mandatory overtime for the next two weekends to process a backlog of tax returns flagged as having possible errors. A memo to staff says there may be more mandatory overtime if employees don’t do enough to drive down the backlog. The mandatory overtime applies to Input Correction Operation employees working in Kansas City. Weekday overtime is also available, but doesn’t count toward the required 16 hours of weekend overtime.

The Defense Health Agency has struggled to ensure reasonable and consistent TRICARE payments for certain medical procedures, especially those lacking established reimbursement rates. The Defense Department inspector general found that TRICARE East and West region contractors used state prevailing rates that varied drastically between states. For example, the TRICARE East region contractor paid a state prevailing rate of $11,500 for a sleep apnea mouthguard in Illinois versus $3,000 in Iowa. In fiscal 2023, TRICARE contractors also paid inflated rates for certain procedures and equipment that lacked established reimbursement rates. The watchdog recommended that the Defense Health Agency revise its methodology for setting state prevailing rates to ensure pricing is reasonable and consistent.

The Defense Department’s new intellectual property guidebook provides acquisition professionals with guidance on implementing IP laws and regulations. It also outlines the legal and operational challenges when acquiring IP rights. The effort was led by the DoD’s IP Cadre — a division within Acquisition Policy and Innovation that coordinates department-wide efforts to modernize IP policies. In addition to the guidebook, the IP Cadre also developed an “IP for Product Support Toolkit” to help acquisition personnel identify, evaluate and implement IP strategies that support cost efficiency across the program lifecycle.

The Defense Department’s latest effort to obtain secure software kicked off a 90-day sprint to develop a framework and implementation plan under the Software Fast Track (SWFT) initiative. Katie Arrington, who is performing the duties of the DoD chief information officer, issued a memo to launch this new effort to help expedite the cybersecurity authorizations for rapid software adoption. At the same time, the DoD CIO’s office released three requests for information under SWFT. They are asking vendors for insights around tools, external assessments and how to best use automation and artificial intelligence to assist DoD-led risk assessment for expedited cybersecurity authorizations. Responses to the RFIs are due by May 20.

Throughout his career, Malanoski has been instrumental in shaping military health care delivery, particularly during the DHA's formative years.

Malanoski’s journey began in 1973, when he joined the Navy through a Reserve Officers' Training Corps scholarship program. After graduating from Georgetown University School of Medicine, he served in various leadership positions, including as the first commanding officer of Naval Support Activity Bethesda, before retiring from active duty in 2011.

His military background instilled in him a problem-solving mindset.

""The Navy teaches you there's no such thing as a problem that doesn't have a solution. Sometimes you just run out of time,"" Malanoski said in an exit interview.

During his tenure at the DHA, Malanoski helped lead a remarkable transformation of military health care.

""What the DHA accomplished in two years is nothing short of remarkable. They stood up a headquarters while at the same time moving out on some major initiatives and change efforts in what some would see as an unachievable timeline,"" he said.

Under Malanoski's leadership, the DHA successfully transitioned from markets to networks in just eight months – a process that typically takes years in most Defense Department organizations. He credits much of this success to the DHA's organizational agility and shared core values.

Looking toward the DHA's future, Malanoski believes the agency is asking the right questions: ""What system do you want? And then we can tell you how much that will cost."" This approach, he argues, will help align resources with mission requirements.

His advice to future leaders?

""If you're looking at something and there's not a chance you can fail, it probably isn't worth doing,"" he said.

After retirement, Malanoski plans to take time for himself, driving around the country and enjoying the opportunity to reflect on a fulfilling career and consider what comes next.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-05-06 15:56:42.309147
