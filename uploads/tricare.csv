Air Force Master Sgt. Jason and Latoya Singleton arrived at Yokota four years ago with their son, Jasir, who is on the autism spectrum.

They quickly learned how difficult navigating the Exceptional Family Member Program can be overseas, Latoya Singleton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 17 at Yokota’s Yujo Community Center. Therapies were limited and providers often didn’t accept Tricare, the Defense Department health insurance plan for military families.

The Singletons pieced together therapies in Tokyo, often paying out of pocket. Over time, they became the “go-to” family for others seeking guidance, she said.

“We were literally paying everything out of pocket for all his therapies,” she said. “Eventually, therapists started referring new families to us and saying, ‘This is the family you want to talk to.’”

This spring, Singleton created Yokota Thrives, a network of nearly 50 families that share resources and push for inclusive base events.

“I wanted to open up a community where people could feel safe,” she said. “There’s still a stigma in the military, especially overseas, that if your child has autism you’ll automatically get sent back. That’s not true. There are a lot of kids here, and they still need resources.”

Kristi Forbes, a registered nurse at Yokota Middle School, said her son has non-verbal learning disability, a new diagnosis not officially on the autism spectrum. She often seeks advice on Yokota Thrives’ Facebook page.

“The group has been very helpful because even though it’s not the same diagnosis that most of the parents are dealing with, there’s a lot of similarities,” she said by phone on Sept. 19.

In the first Defense Department survey across the EFMP between November 2022 and March 2023, only 43% of enrolled members said their families’ needs were “largely met,” while 17% reported they weren’t met at all.

For parents overseas, the hurdles multiply.

“When we first got here, [Applied Behavior Analysis] therapy wasn’t available at all,” Singleton said. “We were driving an hour and a half into Tokyo and paying out of pocket. Now there’s a provider that takes Tricare, so that’s a big improvement.”

Yokota Thrives is pushing for sensory-friendly hours at the library and swimming pool, adjusted lighting at events and better advertisement of EFMP programs, she said. During a July 24 spouses’ luncheon with 374th Airlift Wing commander Col. Richard McElhaney, Singleton discussed her ideas with him and other leaders.

“I talked to them about it, and they were like, ‘You know, that’s a good idea. You know, this is something that we should look into.’”

Later, she met with the Force Support Squadron and EFMP representatives to discuss her overall vision.

“They told me, ‘Our spaces are already EFMP-friendly,’” she said. “But just because the physical space is there doesn’t mean the social aspect works for our kids.”

The USO, for example, gave Yokota Thrives the first hour of its Aug. 20 Summer Splash as a sensory-friendly option. Neurodivergent children played outside with bubble makers and water guns or painted and customized shirts.

“USO cares about all military families,” USO event coordinator Amber Laughton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 19. “We try our best to do whatever we can do to create that inclusive space and environment.

The Singletons expect Yokota Thrives to continue thriving after they depart Yokota in March.

“Even if there are no events, I want it to continue to be a safe space. A place where you can go for resources,” Latoya Singleton said. “The biggest thing is inclusion, not just existing.”",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/57qnx1-071125yokota-thrivesphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/071125YOKOTA-THRIVESphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-06 09:00:38.933279

For military couples, a legal marriage isn’t just about love — it’s about security, stability, and access to benefits that protect both spouses. Health care through TRICARE, housing through BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing), and family recognition through DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) are all tied directly to your marital status.

But not all marriages are recognized equally by the U.S. military.

While Utah’s online marriage system has made headlines for being fast and fully virtual, many service members are finding out too late that a virtual ceremony doesn’t automatically qualify for military benefits.

This guide explains why, under Department of Defense policy, Utah’s online marriages can cause delays or denials in DEERS, TRICARE, and BAH — and why Get Married Today in California offers the only guaranteed path to full and immediate recognition.

⚖️ What Is a Utah Online Marriage?

Utah County allows couples to get married entirely online — no travel required. You can apply for a license and have an officiant marry you via video conference. It’s quick, affordable, and legally valid under U.S. state law.

For civilian couples, this is often a convenient option. The certificate is valid for name changes, taxes, and even immigration.

However, the military follows a separate recognition standard, and that’s where problems begin.

🪖 The Military’s Legal Standard for Recognizing Marriages

According to DoD Instruction 1000.25 and 1341.2, the military will only recognize a marriage if it is legally valid in the jurisdiction where it took place and both parties were physically present at the ceremony.

Proxy or virtual marriages — even if legal under state law — require proof of consummation before they’re recognized for:

DEERS enrollment

TRICARE health coverage

BAH payments

Military ID card issuance

Overseas dependent sponsorship

This means that a marriage performed online, where neither spouse was physically together, isn’t valid for benefits until consummation occurs and can be proven.

⚠️ Real-World Consequences for Service Members

Many service members discover these rules only after applying for benefits:

TRICARE Denials: The spouse isn’t added to the system until physical presence is proven.

Delayed BAH: Payments are withheld because the marriage is under review.

Command Issues: Units may require additional affidavits or proof.

Stress and Financial Strain: Couples lose months of housing pay and coverage.

For couples preparing for deployment, these delays can create serious hardship.

💒 The California Advantage — In-Person Marriage with Get Married Today

In California, Get Married Today performs fully legal, in-person marriages that meet every DoD requirement for immediate recognition.

When both spouses are physically present, the marriage certificate is automatically valid for:

DEERS Enrollment

TRICARE Activation

BAH and Dependent Pay

SGLI Beneficiary Updates

Command Recognition and Housing Access

You walk away the same day with proof of marriage — ready to update your records on base without delay.

⚡ How Get Married Today Simplifies the Entire Process

Instant Marriage License: Issued on-site by a California Deputy Commissioner of Civil Marriages.

Same-Day Legal Ceremony: In-person and compliant with DoD rules.

Immediate Proof: You leave with documentation to enroll your spouse in DEERS.

Certified Copies: Ready for TRICARE and finance offices within days.

Apostille Option: For overseas commands or foreign spouses.

This process ensures zero risk of rejection or benefit delays.

✈️ Why This Matters for Deployed or Stationed Military Members

If you’re preparing for deployment, you don’t have time for administrative delays. A Utah online marriage may require weeks of review and additional proof, while a California in-person marriage is recognized instantly.

That means your spouse’s healthcare, housing, and dependent status are secured before you leave.

📜 Department of Defense Policies Explained

Key DoD References:

DoDI 1000.25 – Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)

DoDI 1341.2 – BAH and Dependent Pay Policies

These instructions state that a marriage must be legally valid under state law and involve physical presence. The requirement exists to prevent fraud and ensure documentation integrity across all branches.

🧭 Comparison Chart

🌍 Common Scenarios

Scenario 1: Overseas Military Member

A deployed service member marries online through Utah but can’t add their spouse to DEERS until returning home — months later.

Scenario 2: Active-Duty Couple in California

They complete their marriage through Get Married Today in person. They submit proof to DEERS the next morning — benefits start within 72 hours.

Scenario 3: Mixed Nationality Couple

A U.S. service member and foreign partner marry with Get Married Today and apostille the certificate the same day for use abroad.

📘 Legal References Supporting California Recognition

California Family Code §359: Authorizes marriage license issuance by Deputy Commissioners.

DoDI 1000.25 & 1341.2: Establish federal recognition rules.

The good news? The TRICARE Dental Program covers emergency dental care, as noted in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook. You’ll pay no cost-share for emergency dental services, no matter your pay grade or location.

“In any emergency, it’s important to act quickly,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency. “With a bit of preparation and knowledge, you can do your best to keep any damage to a minimum.”

Keep reading to learn how to prepare for dental emergencies and what to do when they happen.

What is a dental emergency?

A dental emergency requires immediate attention. You need emergency care if you have:

Bleeding that won’t stop

Pain that doesn’t get better with medication

Broken facial bones

Painful swelling in or around your mouth

Gum infection with pain or swelling

Knocked out or broken tooth

How to prepare

Keep your dentist’s contact information with you at all times. Many dentists have emergency numbers you can call after business hours.

Build a dental emergency kit with these items:

Cotton balls and swabs

Dental floss

Dental mirror

Latex or vinyl gloves

Salt

Cold compress

What to do

Call your dentist first. This is the most important step in any dental emergency. If you don’t have a dentist, use the Find a Dentist tool or go to an urgent care center or emergency room.

For severe tooth pain

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Use dental floss to remove any stuck food.

Apply a cold compress to the outside of your mouth if you have swelling.

Take over-the-counter pain relievers.

For a cracked or broken tooth

Save any broken pieces and rinse them.

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Apply gauze to bleeding areas for 10 minutes.

Use a cold compress on the outside of your mouth to reduce pain and swelling.

For a knocked-out tooth

Find the tooth and hold it by the crown.

Rinse the root gently with water.

Try to put the tooth back in its socket if possible.

If you can’t put it back, place it in a small container of milk or salt water.

See your dentist within one hour for the best chance of saving the tooth.

For mouth bleeding

Rinse with mild salt water.

Press a damp gauze on the bleeding spot for 15-20 minutes.

Hold a cold compress on the outside of your mouth for 5-10 minutes.

If bleeding persists, go to the emergency room immediately.

When it’s not an emergency

Some dental problems can wait for a regular appointment:

Mild toothache

Small chip or crack

Broken braces (unless bleeding)

Something stuck between teeth

Minor cuts or sores

If you seek emergency dental care, but your dentist determines it’s not an emergency, you’ll pay the cost-shares for the care you receive.

For these issues, call your dentist to schedule an appointment during normal hours.

Emergency room or dentist?

For most dental emergencies like broken or knocked-out teeth, your dentist will treat you in his or her office. Go to the emergency room for serious injuries like broken facial bones.

Emergency rooms can give you pain medication and antibiotics, but they don’t do dental work like fillings or crowns. You’ll still need to see your dentist as soon as possible.

Dental emergencies need quick action. The faster you get help, the better your chances of saving your teeth and avoiding additional problems later. Remember:

Call your dentist.

Follow first aid steps until you can get professional care.

Don’t wait, prompt treatment prevents infection and tooth loss.

Koper spent 32 years in uniform, all of it in the Ohio Air National Guard. Before retiring in 1996, he led the first Ohio Air Guard visit to the Republic of Hungary, the state’s State Partnership Program partner.

During his time at NGAUS, the association secured congressional approval of low-cost TRICARE Reserve Select medical coverage for most drill-status Guardsmen.

Koper also launched the effort to correct an oversight in the original language of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Initially, it did not include benefits for those serving on active duty during the Global War on Terrorism in a Title 32 status service.

And he was at association’s controls when Congress approved a fourth star for National Guard Bureau chief.

Retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the current NGAUS president, began his 15 years on the association board near the end of Koper’s time in the position.

“He was a tireless, passionate advocate for the National Guard in the 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia,” McGinn said. “He was a great role model for all of us who have had the privilege of following him.”

Koper was also a member of the National Guard Educational Foundation’s Legion de Lafayette, which is reserved for large benefactors of the foundation, McGinn noted.

Before coming to NGAUS, he served as executive director of the Ohio National Guard Association from 1995 to 2004 and as president of the National Guard Executive Directors Association in 2000.

In 2006, he received the Colonel James F. Gamble Award, NGEDA’s highest honor for support

of the member states and activities.

Also successful in business, he was the president of S. K. Graphics Inc., a print consulting and brokerage firm. He also did a stint as a director and subsequently chairman of the Printing Industries Association of Southern Ohio.

BiomX (PHGE, Financial) receives FDA endorsement for its BX011 phage therapy targeting diabetic foot infections (DFI).

Significant non-dilutive funding of $40 million from U.S. Defense Health Agency and Department of Navy supports development.

BiomX operates in the biotechnology sector, focusing on phage therapies for chronic diseases.

BiomX (PHGE) has received affirmative feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding its clinical development strategy for BX011. This novel multi-phage cocktail aims to combat Staphylococcus aureus in diabetic foot infections (DFI). The FDA's input endorses BiomX’s progression of its phage therapy for DFIs as the next clinical application, building on the prior Phase 2 study of BX211, which targeted diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) linked to S. aureus.

The focus on DFI is driven by three main factors: a larger patient base with unfulfilled medical needs, substantial commercial potential, and a distinct regulatory route informed by established FDA guidelines. As both DFI and DFO involve the S. aureus pathogen, DFI is positioned as the initial indication for regulatory approval before exploring further DFO development. BX011 is composed of multiple proprietary phages, including those assessed in the BX211 study.

Approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from U.S. Defense Health Agency and the Department of Navy supports BiomX's efforts. Moving forward, further development of BX011 will align with dialogues with the U.S. Defense Health Agency and depend on financial resources to commence a Phase 2a trial in DFIs. The FDA has provided a clear path for a potential Biologics License Application, with no additional non-clinical studies required, affirming BiomX’s manufacturing and quality strategies.

Company Overview and Market Position

BiomX Inc is engaged in developing both natural and engineered phage cocktails and personalized treatments designed to target and destroy harmful bacteria in chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and diabetic foot osteomyelitis. It discovers and validates proprietary bacterial targets and customizes phage compositions against these targets, applying its BOLT (BacteriOphage Lead to Treatment) platform. The company operates within the Healthcare sector, specifically in the Biotechnology industry, with a market capitalization of approximately $11.25 million.

Financial Health Analysis

BiomX's financial health presents several challenges:

Revenue growth remains stagnant with zero revenue reported, indicating a focus on development rather than commercialization.

Profitability metrics are concerning, with a negative EPS of -1.01 and a ROE of -69.73%.

Income has also been cut off for some dual-income military families.
That means doctors, therapists, and medical offices treating military families are now forced to wait for reimbursement.
Military families sacrifice stability, predictability, and support systems so their loved ones can serve the nation.
Through her social media and nonprofit work, she supports caregivers, disabled individuals, and military families.","As the federal government shutdown continues, much of the national conversation has centered on one question: will service members miss a paycheck? But for military families, it’s so much more than just a possible missed paycheck. For many families, especially junior enlisted households and those caring for medically complex children, the shutdown is proving to be a destabilizing event touching every part of life at once.

Active duty service members are still required to report to duty without any guarantee that the next paycheck will arrive in full or on time. Already, families have reported partial and incorrect pay during the shutdown, in some cases short by hundreds or thousands of dollars. This would be stressful for any American household, and for military families, it comes on top of unique pressures tied to service. Many military families operate on a single income due to frequent moves, deployments, child care challenges, and gaps in support, making consistent employment nearly impossible for spouses. Essential expenses often consume most of their income and make it nearly impossible to build savings, even when budgeting responsibly. Nearly 25% of military households have less than $500 in savings, which leaves little to handle unexpected expenses or financial strain during a shutdown. Income has also been cut off for some dual-income military families. More than 16,000 military spouses are employed by the federal government. When their paychecks pause along with uncertainty around military pay, families are finding themselves with two income streams at risk. It’s especially difficult for families who are already stretched thin, with almost no financial cushion.

Even in typical circumstances one in four military families experience food insecurity and the shutdown is making it worse. A late, reduced, or missed paycheck can lead to parents having to choose between bills and feeding their kids. About 23,000 active duty military households depend on programs like SNAP to help feed their children. While two judges have ordered SNAP contingency funds to be released, families will still face significant delays due to states needing time to receive and process the money and with only a portion of the necessary funding currently available, many households may receive reduced or partial benefits. These are households juggling service, sacrifice, deployments, unpredictable schedules, and the daily demands of raising children while one parent serves the nation. No military family should ever have to worry about whether they can afford groceries.

Healthcare access has also become more uncertain during the shutdown. Coverage through TRICARE continues, but TRICARE has stated that payments to medical providers may be delayed until funding is restored. That means doctors, therapists, and medical offices treating military families are now forced to wait for reimbursement. Some offices have already begun warning families that they may pause services, stop accepting TRICARE, or limit new appointments if the shutdown continues. For military families with medically complex children or loved ones who depend on regular therapies, specialty care, or consistent medical support, even the threat of service interruptions is deeply unsettling. Military pharmacies have begun to experience medication shortages or limited stock, forcing families to fill prescriptions at civilian pharmacies where co-pays apply. Families who normally pay nothing for essential medication have suddenly faced hundreds of dollars in unexpected costs. For children with rare diseases, seizure disorders, respiratory conditions, or other complex needs, medication consistency is a matter of safety, stability, and in some cases, survival. Junior enlisted families, already living on tight budgets, are being forced into impossible choices between medical necessity and what they can realistically afford.

Child care is being hit too. Some base child development centers have already reduced hours or closed certain services during the shutdown, and programs like Head Start are facing funding deadlines that could shut classrooms if this continues. For military families, child care is what allows spouses to work and what holds routines together during deployments and long duty days, it’s what gives medically complex kids and their sibling’s stability and support. And now, with financial uncertainty growing by the day, many families can’t even afford backup or civilian child care options if base care is limited or unavailable. Without child care, parents are left scrambling, jobs are put at risk, and families lose one more layer of stability they rely on.

Housing and relocation are under strain as well. Military families in the middle of permanent change-of-station (PCS) moves are reporting delays in travel approvals, shipment schedules, and on base housing processing due to the shutdown. This is forcing families into extended temporary lodging, prolonged housing overlap, and uncertainty about when their children can enroll in school at their next duty station. On top of the emotional and logistical stress, many families are fronting thousands of dollars in PCS costs and now face delayed reimbursements because of the shutdown, leaving them vulnerable to debt during an already difficult transition.

All of this uncertainty takes a toll on mental health. Military spouses report rising anxiety, stress, and emotional exhaustion. Spouses who are already carrying the load alone during deployments or long duty hours are stretched even further. Service members feel the strain too, especially those serving away from home who have to watch their families struggle without being able to step in and help. The emotional weight ultimately travels with them into their work, affecting focus, readiness, and overall well-being. This is a force readiness issue.

Government shutdowns are often framed as a political impasse or administrative pause. But inside military homes, it looks very different. It looks like a parent desperately calling multiple pharmacies to find seizure medication and hope they can afford it. It looks like a young family calculating whether they can afford groceries and gas in the same week. It looks like a child missing essential therapy sessions because TRICARE may not pay on time. It looks like a spouse refreshing the bank account at midnight hoping the pay processed correctly. It looks like a service member thousands of miles away worrying about whether their family back home can meet their basic needs.

Military families sacrifice stability, predictability, and support systems so their loved ones can serve the nation. They move frequently, endure separations, and stretch budgets that are often already strained. They shouldn’t be pushed into crisis because political leaders fail to work together to fund the basic functions of government.

This shutdown is a cascading threat to financial security, food access, medication continuity, mental health, educational stability, and family readiness. The longer it continues, the higher the cost, not only to military households but also to the force and to national security itself.

Ok I’ll help. 45 minutes would be 3 units. And yes, bill like Medicare timed codes. If the patient only has Tricare, it may be different, but Tricare is a federal government plan, so I think it would be the same billing rules. I see a lot of Medicare with Tricare as secondary, so I follow Medicare billing rules. I’m assuming this company wants you to bill 4 codes and not 3, but that would require you to spend more time to meet the time parameters set by Medicare. Look up the insurance providers in your state to see the type of billing required, but I’m pretty sure you bill as if it was Medicare. Remember it’s your license at stake. Don’t let the company push you into fraudulent billing practice. Best of luck to you.

Physical therapy is a dynamic field that is constantly evolving with new techniques and technologies. Here are some of the innovative techniques and approaches that are making a significant impact in physical therapy:

Exoskeletons for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)

Exoskeletons are advanced robotic devices that help individuals with SCI regain mobility and perform daily activities. These devices provide support and assistance, allowing patients to stand, walk, and even climb stairs. ""Exoskeletons for SCI are making crazy advances which is promising.""

Ultrasound-Guided Dry Needling

Dry needling is a technique that involves inserting thin needles into trigger points in the muscle to relieve pain and improve muscle function. Ultrasound guidance ensures precise placement of the needles, enhancing the effectiveness and safety of the procedure. ""Ultrasound guided dry needling""

Shockwave Therapy

Shockwave therapy uses acoustic waves to stimulate healing in tissues. It is being used to treat various conditions, including tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, and even arthritis, with promising results. ""Europe is doing shockwave for some injuries and arthritis and its showing some good results.""

3D Printing for Adaptive Equipment

3D printing is revolutionizing the creation of custom adaptive equipment, reducing costs and improving accessibility. This includes printing custom-fit braces, prosthetics, and other assistive devices. ""3D printing DME and other costly materials, that would in hope lower the cost by cutting out the middleman.""

Remote Patient Monitoring

Remote patient monitoring allows physical therapists to track their patients' progress and provide guidance from a distance. This is particularly useful for patients in rural areas or those with limited access to clinics. ""So much remote patient monitoring.""

AI in EMR and Treatment Planning

AI is being integrated into electronic medical records (EMR) and treatment planning tools to improve efficiency and accuracy. It can help in diagnosing conditions, recommending exercises, and even providing real-time feedback on performance. ""AI will become more prominent in EMR and other platforms.""

Aquatic Therapy

Aquatic therapy utilizes the buoyancy of water to reduce the load on joints, making it easier for patients to perform exercises. It is particularly beneficial for individuals with conditions like dysautonomia and POTS. ""I had a really positive experience with aquatic therapy.""

Vestibular Exercises

Vestibular exercises are designed to improve balance and reduce dizziness by retraining the brain to process signals from the inner ear correctly. ""My daily dizziness has improved. We talked about moving onto a POTs program which I guess entails equipment such as a recumbent bike.""

Schroth Method for Scoliosis

The Schroth Method is a specialized physical therapy approach for scoliosis that focuses on correcting spinal alignment through specific exercises and breathing techniques. ""I went to pt for over a year with no tangible improvements. Finally started paying for schroth and my pain has definitely decreased""

Motivational Interviewing

Motivational interviewing is a communication technique used by physical therapists to help patients take ownership of their rehabilitation and improve compliance with home exercise programs. ""Motivational interviewing has been a fantastic tool to improve compliance for my patients.""

If you’ve ever wondered how to get TRICARE, the very first thing to nail down is eligibility. It’s kind of the gateway to everything else. Simply put, TRICARE is a health care program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families, including some survivors. But it’s not one-size-fits-all—your eligibility depends on your military status and circumstances.

For starters, active duty service members and their families qualify, but so do National Guard and Reserve members when they’re activated. Retired military personnel and their dependents are also in, along with certain survivors and Medal of Honor recipients. Even some former spouses may be eligible under specific conditions.

Knowing your qualification status upfront is more than just a box to tick. It affects which TRICARE plans you can access, and those plans have different coverage levels and costs.

According to the official TRICARE Eligibility page, ensuring your DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) record is up to date is essential. Without that, even if you qualify, your access might get delayed or denied. So, keep that information current to prevent headaches.

Alright, you’ve checked eligibility—now how do you actually sign up? The hub for TRICARE enrollment is milConnect, an online portal where you manage your military benefits and health records.

Here’s a laid-back walk-through to get you enrolled without pulling your hair out:

Create or log into your milConnect account. Using your DoD ID or DS Logon credentials is your gateway here.

Verify your information. Double-check your personal and family data matches exactly what’s in DEERS.

Pick your TRICARE plan. There’s a bunch of options—TRICARE Prime, Select, Young Adult, etc. More on that later.

Submit your enrollment. After choosing your plan and reviewing costs, finalize the process online.

Keep a copy of your confirmation. Important if you need proof later or want to check your status.

Keep in mind, milConnect doesn’t play well with Internet Explorer anymore—you’ll need to use browsers like Edge, Firefox, or Chrome for smooth sailing. If tech issues hit, there’s a 24/7 support line just waiting for your call at (800) 477-8227.

This video clears up a lot of confusion about how TRICARE fits with Medicare and VA care, which is super handy if you’re juggling multiple benefits. Definitely worth a watch if you’re sorting through the maze of military health options.

Common Enrollment Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

There’s nothing worse than thinking you did all the right stuff only to find your TRICARE coverage isn’t kicking in. So, let’s talk about some of the usual slip-ups and how to dodge them:

Outdated DEERS info. This is the big one. Your eligibility can be flagged if your address, family status, or other details aren’t current.

Missing deadlines. TRICARE has specific windows for enrollment. If you miss those, you might face delays or have to pay penalties.

Choosing the wrong plan. Not every plan fits every lifestyle—picking the cheapest might leave you with hefty out-of-pocket costs later.

Not understanding your coverage. Some services require referrals or prior authorization. Skipping these steps can mean denied claims.

Assuming automatic enrollment. Spoiler: TRICARE usually requires you to actively sign up. Don’t just presume you’re covered.

To save yourself from these headaches, take a little extra time reviewing your info before submitting, mark key dates in your calendar, and ask questions if you’re unsure. Trust me, a quick call to the DEERS Support Office at (800) 538-9552 can clarify a lot.

Real-Life User Scenarios: Choosing the Right Plan for Your Needs

Picking your TRICARE plan feels like navigating a mini labyrinth unless you get clear on your personal circumstances.

Scenario 1: Active Duty Family Looking for Hassle-Free Coverage

If you’re an active duty member or your spouse, TRICARE Prime tends to be the easiest. It offers a managed care approach with a primary care manager and referrals for specialists. It’s low-cost, with less paperwork, perfect if you want predictable care without much legwork.

Scenario 2: Retiree on a Budget but Wants Flexibility

TRICARE Select might be your go-to. It lets you choose your providers without a referral, but costs are a little higher. Great if you want freedom but still want to keep expenses manageable.

Scenario 3: Young Adult Aging Out of Dependent Coverage

Your options here include TRICARE Young Adult or even continuing some benefits up to 26 years old. Each has different premiums and coverage options, so it pays to check the details.

Quick Plan Comparison Plan Cost Primary Care Manager Referrals Needed TRICARE Prime Lowest Yes Yes TRICARE Select Moderate No No TRICARE Young Adult Varies No No

As highlighted by the official TRICARE enrollment page, enrolling in the right plan for your lifestyle can streamline getting the care you need without surprises. So, don’t rush—consider your care needs, budget, and convenience before committing.

Expert Tips for Maintaining Your Coverage Without Stress

So you got your TRICARE up and running—awesome! But wait, ongoing upkeep is key. You don’t want your coverage to drop out on you just because you forgot to update your address or re-enroll when required.

Keep DEERS updated. It bears repeating because it’s that crucial. Every time your life changes—marriage, move, baby—tell DEERS within 30 days.

Mark enrollment periods. Some coverage plans need annual renewal or updates. You’ll get notifications, but setting your own reminders helps dodge lapses.

Check your healthcare providers. If you prefer certain doctors, verify they still accept your TRICARE plan to avoid unexpected refusals.

Keep track of your health benefits card. It’s your ticket to painless claims.

Reach out if confused. The DMDC/DEERS Support Office is not just a phone number; it’s your lifeline for help.

A little effort every few months keeps the whole system humming smoothly and saves you from last-minute panics before big appointments.

Why Military Spouses Should Claim Every Benefit They Earned Military spouses sacrifice careers, stability, and time with loved ones in service to the country.","Military spouses hold families together through deployments, relocations, and constant change—but many don’t realize just how many benefits they’re entitled to. From education grants to home loan programs, hidden perks are designed to ease the financial and emotional load of military life. Yet thousands of eligible spouses never claim them, leaving valuable resources unused. Whether you’re active duty, retired, or part of the Reserve or National Guard community, these programs can make a real difference. Here are 10 powerful benefits military spouses should be taking advantage of right now.

1. MyCAA Education and Career Grants

The My Career Advancement Account (MyCAA) program offers up to $4,000 in tuition assistance for spouses pursuing certifications, licenses, or associate degrees in portable career fields. It’s available to spouses of active-duty service members in pay grades E1–E5, W1–W2, and O1–O2. Whether you’re training for nursing, IT, or education, MyCAA covers approved institutions and career programs. Many participants complete training entirely online, making it easy to learn from anywhere.

2. Free Career Coaching and Resume Support

The Military Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP) connects spouses with employers who actively seek military talent. You can access one-on-one career coaching, federal resume help, and job boards featuring companies that understand the demands of military life. It’s an excellent resource for remote and portable positions. The partnership’s goal: make sure your career moves with you every PCS.

3. Military Home Loans and Fee Waivers

Military families can access special VA loan benefits, even if the service member isn’t the one applying. Surviving spouses of veterans may also qualify for zero-down VA home loans with no mortgage insurance. Many states offer additional property tax exemptions or closing-cost waivers. For families constantly relocating, these programs remove massive financial hurdles to homeownership.

4. Scholarships for Spouses and Children

Nonprofits like Fisher House Foundation, National Military Family Association (NMFA), and ThanksUSA offer annual scholarships to military spouses pursuing higher education. Awards typically range from $1,000–$5,000 and are available across all branches. Even dependents can qualify for additional funds through state programs or base-specific scholarships. Education doesn’t have to stop when your spouse deploys.

5. Free or Discounted Childcare Programs

Through Child Care Aware of America, military families can receive fee assistance for civilian childcare centers when on-base care isn’t available. Fees adjust to your rank and income, often cutting childcare costs by 50% or more. For dual-working spouses, this benefit can save thousands annually. It’s one of the most underused yet essential resources for families balancing military and career life.

6. Health Coverage Continuation Through TRICARE

Spouses and dependents qualify for TRICARE, which provides comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage. Even after separation, some families can extend benefits through the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP). It bridges the gap while transitioning to civilian insurance. TRICARE also covers mental health services—something many families overlook but deeply need after deployments or relocations.

7. Military Store and Travel Discounts

Don’t overlook commissary privileges, base exchanges, and Space-A travel benefits. Spouses can save up to 30% on groceries and essentials, plus access deeply discounted flights through the military’s space-available program. ID cards are key—make sure yours is current to unlock access. These everyday discounts can stretch budgets significantly, especially overseas or in high-cost-of-living areas.

8. Free Financial Counseling and Tax Prep

Military spouses have access to free financial counseling, budget coaching, and tax preparation services through Military OneSource and on-base family centers. Certified counselors can help with debt reduction, investment planning, and benefits optimization. During tax season, Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) centers provide free, expert-level filing for both state and federal returns. One session could save hundreds in accountant fees.

9. Support for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Grants

Programs like Patriot Boot Camp, Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE), and SBA’s Office of Veterans Business Development offer training and funding to military spouses starting small businesses. These initiatives help turn mobile-friendly ideas into real income. From Etsy shops to consulting firms, the military spouse community has become one of the fastest-growing groups of entrepreneurs in the U.S.

10. Survivor Benefits and Retirement Continuation

If the service member passes away, the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides ongoing monthly payments to the spouse. Combined with Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), this financial safety net ensures stability after loss. Spouses also remain eligible for commissary, TRICARE, and base privileges under specific conditions. It’s a benefit no one wants to need—but one every spouse should understand.

Why Military Spouses Should Claim Every Benefit They Earned

Military spouses sacrifice careers, stability, and time with loved ones in service to the country. These benefits aren’t handouts—they’re earned rights meant to ease that burden. Knowing and using them can strengthen your finances, education, and overall well-being. Don’t let red tape or lack of awareness keep you from resources designed to support your family’s future.

Are you or someone you know a military spouse? Which benefits have made the biggest difference—or which ones were hardest to discover?

As the military chapter of the ACS, the ESS provides a voice and serves as a dedicated community for military surgeons within the nation’s largest surgical organization. The ESS acts as both a gateway for trainees beginning their ACS journey and a bridge for military surgeons moving into civilian practice. This military–civilian partnership aims to preserve the lessons of the past, improve care in the present, and anticipate the challenges of the future.

Baird is a captain in the United States Army and joined UAB in 2021 as the General Surgery Residency Program’s first ever military resident. Before completing medical school, Baird was a civilian counterterrorism analyst for the Department of Defense. Her deployment in this role gave her exposure to combat casualty care, which inspired her to attend the Uniformed Services University and become a military trauma surgeon.

As a medical student, she was named an abstract winner in the American College of Physicians National Abstract Competition for her work on enteral resuscitation in burn shock, highlighting innovative approaches to fluid management when IV therapy is limited. During residency, she has presented research at the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Annual Meeting alongside UAB faculty, contributing to studies that strengthen military-civilian surgical partnerships and trauma readiness. Her research interests focus on combat casualty care, surgical innovation, and optimizing medical technology for austere environments.

“It’s an incredible honor to represent residents and fellows in the Excelsior Surgical Society,” Baird said. “Military medicine is built on collaboration, resilience, and shared service, and I’m excited to help strengthen mentorship and engagement opportunities across all training levels.”",https://www.uab.edu/joomla4/media/templates/site/sleepyDragon/favicon/favicon-196x196.png,N,0.0,2025-11-03 13:02:14.938565

And though she and her husband are stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Ashcraft is grateful for Open Season in its entirety.
“It’s great when everything is free, but if your current TRICARE plan isn’t adequate, it’s not worth it,” she said.
Open Season applies for those who already have, or qualify for, TRICARE Prime, U.S. Family Health Plan or TRICARE Select.
This year’s TRICARE Open Season runs from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9.","When Army spouse Ashley Ashcraft first approached her husband about TRICARE’s Open Season — where beneficiaries have roughly one month from mid-November to mid-December to switch health plans for the upcoming year — he was hesitant.

“It’s free if we stay with TRICARE Prime,” he pointed out. “Why should we switch plans to TRICARE Select and have co-pays and deductibles?”

But a health scare with one of the Ashcrafts’ children demonstrated the need for more flexibility in their TRICARE plan.

After hearing about Open Season from other military families, they researched and found that switching from TRICARE Prime to TRICARE Select would allow them to book appointments for most primary and specialty care with any TRICARE-authorized providers without referrals. Pre-authorization from a member’s regional provider might be necessary in certain services.

And though some out-of-pocket costs vary depending on the sponsor’s military status, the couple realized Select’s pros outweighed its costs for them.

“We saw that if we switched over to Select, we wouldn’t have the wait times and could see the best doctors in the area without getting told who to see,” Ashcraft said. “That became worth it.”

Their decision became even firmer when they had a daughter diagnosed with Down syndrome and heart issues in 2023.

Open Season, which began in 2018, gives beneficiaries “maximum flexibility” so they can reevaluate every year and make health plan changes based on their family needs, according to Zelly Zim, a health system specialist with Policy and Programs at TRICARE.

“That’s the most important part,” Zim said.

Since its onset, the annual Open Season window usually sees “anywhere from 10[,000] to 20,000” beneficiaries switch plans, according to Zim. There could be any number of reasons why a beneficiary might consider switching, she said, including someone’s location and access to military hospitals and clinics, changes in military status or a desire for flexibility in picking providers.

“What type of access does your family need for care? Do you want to be going through a Primary Care Provider? Are you wanting to see a specialist?” she said. “There are a lot of families throughout their career who found that one plan or the other makes more sense.”

Zim said that looking at out-of-pockets costs, how healthy someone is in a given year or during that phase helps determine if a beneficiary should consider making changes during Open Season.

There’s something unique about this year’s Open Season, too: some TRICARE beneficiaries in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, areas can enroll in the TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans for expanded care opportunities.

“The goal is to give our beneficiaries an additional option,” Zim said.

And though she and her husband are stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Ashcraft is grateful for Open Season in its entirety.

“It’s great when everything is free, but if your current TRICARE plan isn’t adequate, it’s not worth it,” she said. “We have seen some of the best doctors in the whole country for what our daughter needs without the red tape because of being able to switch from Prime to Select — what a gift!”

Zim recommended that all military-connected families first check which plans they are eligible for. Also, beneficiaries should ensure all information is up-to-date with the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), especially with any recent births, adoptions or marriages.

Open Season applies for those who already have, or qualify for, TRICARE Prime, U.S. Family Health Plan or TRICARE Select. Those interested can find the best plan for them at TRICARE’s online plan finder at https://tricare.mil/Plans.
