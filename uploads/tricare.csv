In a 19-page finding, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said that the services are inconsistent in their gambling prevention methods, and that the Department of Defense should clearly define roles and responsibilities for staff to help curb the issue.

Multiple academic studies have reported that gambling addiction is on the rise as a whole since the legalization of state-sponsored sports betting in 2018. A 2021 Rutgers University study found that troops were at an increased risk of gambling abuse, given a young military population, the prevalence of risk-taking, stress and other factors that make it more likely for service members to develop the disorder.

Based on available data from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the report found that 185 troops self-reported a gambling-related diagnosis last year. That’s up about 30 percent from 2019.

In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that states could authorize sports betting and since then, online and app-based sports betting has exploded in America. Experts have said that troops can easily fall into a troublesome gambling pit.

“You are a risk taker. You’re competitive. It lines up perfectly. Now you’ve created apps that are addictive,” Mark Lucia, a program manager at Kindbridge Research Institute, which studies gambling disorders in the military, previously told Task & Purpose. But he added that “we don’t have anything that even offers something remotely that looks like a smoking gun, that this is a huge issue.”

Notably, the GAO report said that recreational establishments owned by the military operate slot machines around the world, with some services raking in tens of millions of dollars a year that then go back to funding recreational programs.

However, military officials told the GAO that retirees, contractors and family members primarily use these machines, and that anecdotal evidence suggested that active duty troops were attracted to commercial gambling options, especially online.

The military issued a policy in January addressing “problematic substance use and gambling disorder,” but the GAO report said that it did not adequately assign oversight for its implementation or specific staff responsible for preventing, assessing, diagnosing and treating the issue.

Top Stories This Week

The DHA is expected to issue the first of what will become an annual report next year, the GAO report said, which aims to track prevalence and trends among service members when it comes to gambling.

Meanwhile, Task & Purpose previously reported that owners of sports betting apps such as FanDuel, BetMGM and DraftKings were calling for more research into gambling abuse, the latter of which announced in 2023 it would be funding research into the disorder among veterans.

Experts in behavioral science acknowledged that limited treatment and reporting for this specific disorder has made it difficult to study. The GAO report said that DHA survey response rates for gambling disorders were less than five percent. On top of that, service members must receive a diagnosis of a gambling disorder to receive care, which is likely a tall order in an organization that has long struggled to overcome its stigma in seeking care for mental health issues overall.

The recommendations from the GAO were directed at all of the services and generally called for them to update policy to be more in line with the recently-released DoD directive from January.",https://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1430548801-e1751556352205.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-09-29 18:56:19.442188

Kennedy Reeves, a public health nurse and chief of Munson’s Department of Public Health. “Flu can lead to serious illness, hospitalization, or even death, especially among young children, older adults, and those with certain medical conditions.”

Reeves added that influenza viruses change from year to year, making annual vaccination important. The flu vaccine reduces the risk of infection, and for those who do become ill, it can lessen the severity and duration of symptoms.

Common symptoms of influenza include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and fatigue. Complications may include pneumonia, worsening of chronic medical conditions, and in some cases, life-threatening outcomes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual flu vaccination for everyone six months and older, unless otherwise advised by a healthcare provider.

(2023).","Having a strong social network helps support your psychological health and keeps you mission ready. Feeling connected is especially important during tough times. However, frequent moves and deployments can make it hard to maintain close relationships. Fortunately, positive social media use can help you keep up with friends and family and get or give support when the going gets tough.

POSITIVE SOCIAL MEDIA USE

The following are positive ways you can use social media to support psychological health:

Stay in touch with loved ones: this is especially important on deployment. Use social media to exchange updates. This can give you and your family a sense of comfort. It can also remind you to stay strong for those you care about.

Find support during tough times: if you are struggling, you can use social media and apps to locate important psychological health resources.

Settle in a new location: moves can be challenging for you and your family. Fortunately, using social media can help you learn about a new area. You can find entertainment and services, learn about community events, and join social groups. This can help your family quickly find a sense of belonging

Stay up to date on base and unit information: many installations and units have their own social media pages. These pages can help you learn about events, emergencies, deployments and more.

Support fellow warriors: You may be the first line of support for fellow service members who are struggling. Share helpful resources on your social media profiles. Keep an eye out for posts that could mean a member of the military community, friend, family member is struggling. Reach out to support them. Even sharing something sympathetic can let them know you have their back.

GETTING CARE

Social media can help you locate resources and connect with care. The social connections you forge can even help you cope during difficult times and support your recovery after traumatic events. However, social media is never a replacement for formal care. If you have psychological health concerns because of your military service or home life, talk to a psychological health care provider. Connect with a provider by visiting your nearest military hospital or clinic. To locate care in your area, use TRICARE's hospital and clinic finder (https://www.tricare.mil/GettingCare/FindDoctor/mtf) or call the MHS Nurse Advice Line at 1-800-TRICARE (874-2273) and press 1.

STAYING SAFE ON SOCIAL MEDIA

Even though social media has many benefits, you should be mindful of personal and operational security while using it:

-Stay informed of Defense Department, branch and unit policies.

-Update your operating system and web browser.

-Avoid sharing details like specific dates or locations.

-Be wary of mobile apps that mark or record your location.

-Stay current on privacy policies for each of the social networks you use.

-Keep electronics locked when not in use.

-Guard your passwords and change them frequently.

If you are feeling distress as the result of military service or other life stress, reach out for help. You can contact the Psychological Health Resource Center 24/7 at 866-966-1020 or use the live chat (https://home-c72.niceincontact.com/incontact/chatclient/index.html) to confidentially speak with trained health resource consultants.

,,2025-09-29 11:03:05+00:00,Snopes,Contextualizing claims Trump deployed National Guard on 29-day orders to avoid paying benefits,Rae Deng,,,,,https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/09/29/trump-national-guard-29-days/,"As of this writing, there have been two major National Guard deployments set into motion by Trump in 2025.
Daniel Szarek, a spokesperson for the Mississippi National Guard, said via email that the ""claims you are referencing are factually inaccurate.""
On Reddit, various users of the National Guard subreddit joked about being put on 29-day orders in the district.
In sum … There is no concrete evidence the Trump administration has been repeatedly activating National Guard members on 29-day orders to avoid paying benefits to them.
In the District of Columbia, where Trump both deployed the district's guard and requested governors send their own states' guard members, the situation is more complicated.","In 2025, a claim circulated online that U.S. President Donald Trump had repeatedly deployed the National Guard on 29-day cycles to avoid paying out housing and health benefits that activate after 30 days.

The rumor spread on X, Facebook and Instagram. Snopes readers also wrote in to ask whether it was true.

This claim needs context. While it is true that sending the National Guard on a 29-day order can skirt requirements to pay out full benefits, this is a common practice in the guard, according to legitimate news reports.

As of this writing, there have been two major National Guard deployments set into motion by Trump in 2025. In the first instance, when Trump sent the California National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles in June, soldiers received full benefits starting from their first day on active duty due to U.S. law about federal activation, according to the California Military Department.

In the second instance, when Trump deployed the guard to Washington, D.C., ""for the purpose of restoring law and order,"" he actually did so in two ways: He requested governors of other states to send their own National Guard to the district, and he sent the D.C. National Guard, which reports directly to the president, unlike the National Guard in states.

A spokesperson for Joint Task Force — District of Columbia, the mission in charge of the deployment, said that for the purposes of that specific mobilization, ""no service member was intentionally placed on an order of 29 days or less for the purpose of avoiding the allowance or entitlements for which they are entitled.""

""While exceptions may exist, the majority of service members are mobilized on orders extending beyond 30 days, ensuring they qualify for full benefits,"" the spokesperson said via email, adding that states that sent their guard members to D.C. would be responsible for their benefits.

Given the complex nature of this claim, we have not rated it. Here's what we know:

The 29-day limit did not apply to LA

Under federal law, members of the ""reserve components"" of U.S. military — which includes the National Guard — are obligated to the same rate of ""basic allowance for housing"" that regular military members receive under certain circumstances, detailed here:

(4) The rate of basic allowance for housing to be paid to the following members of a reserve component shall be equal to the rate in effect for similarly situated members of a regular component of the uniformed services:

(A) A member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days.

(B) A member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of 30 days or less in support of a contingency operation.

Similar rules apply for health care coverage.

In other words, members of the guard receive full benefits only when called to active duty for more than 30 days or for a ""contingency operation,"" legally defined either as a deployment by the secretary of defense against ""an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military force"" or an activation after the president declares a national emergency or war.

When Trump deployed the California National Guard, he did so under a ""Title 10"" contingency operation, which is when the president calls in the National Guard due to invasion, rebellion, ""danger of a rebellion"" or because the president is ""unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."" That means that regardless of the number of days the guard was deployed, soldiers received full benefits from their first day on active duty, as confirmed by an emailed statement from the California Military Department.

""About 4,300 Soldiers served on this activation and received the same benefits,"" the department said. ""In this case, Soldiers were entitled to full benefits—including housing allowance—from their first day on active duty, regardless of whether their orders were for one day or several months.""

Did the 29-day limit apply to the National Guard in DC?

Unlike in California, Trump's activation of the D.C. National Guard did not fall under Title 10 federal activation because the district's guard answers directly to the president rather than to a governor because the district does not have one. As previously stated, a spokesperson for the joint task force said the Trump administration activated the ""majority"" of the guard under orders lasting more than 30 days.

In a Sept. 4, 2025, X post, Brig. Gen. Leland D. Blanchard II, interim commanding general for the D.C. task force, said he extended the encampment in part to ensure ""Guard members and families retain their activation benefits.""

Guard members from outside states deployed to D.C. by their governors on request of the president ""remain under the administrative control of their home states,"" according to the joint task force spokesperson.

""D.C. Guard works hand-in-hand with those states to ensure every Guard member is paid, supported, and cared for,"" the spokesperson said.

At least six states, all Republican-controlled, have also sent their own National Guard to the district by request of the president: Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Dakota and West Virginia.

Only Mississippi, Georgia and South Dakota responded to inquiries from Snopes. In response to our question about 29-day orders, Georgia National Guard provided a generic statement detailing its support for the D.C. mission and said other questions should go to the task force. South Dakota directed all questions to the task force. Daniel Szarek, a spokesperson for the Mississippi National Guard, said via email that the ""claims you are referencing are factually inaccurate.""

""Our Mississippi Guardsmen are not deployed on 29-day orders and are receiving the benefits they are entitled to,"" Szarek said.

On Reddit, various users of the National Guard subreddit joked about being put on 29-day orders in the district. We filed a records request in an attempt to determine how common these orders were in comparison with the longer orders and await a response.

Many Redditors in the National Guard subreddit also alleged that being put on 29-day orders to avoid paying out benefits has been a common tactic used in the guard long before the Trump administration — although no user felt comfortable providing their name to Snopes for verification due to fear of retaliation. We reached out to a litany of experts and universities with defense studies programs to confirm the frequency of 29-day orders and will update this story if we receive additional information from them.

In sum …

There is no concrete evidence the Trump administration has been repeatedly activating National Guard members on 29-day orders to avoid paying benefits to them. In fact, when the president deployed the California National Guard in June, guard members received full benefits from the first day of work as required by federal law.

In the District of Columbia, where Trump both deployed the district's guard and requested governors send their own states' guard members, the situation is more complicated. According to the joint task force overseeing the deployment in D.C., the Trump administration did not purposefully send anyone out on 29-day orders, and the majority of guard members have received orders lasting more than 30 days, ensuring full benefits. However, it was unclear whether any states' governors have sent their guard members on 29-day orders to the district; only Mississippi's National Guard responded to an inquiry about it and stated that its members are receiving full benefits.",https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2025/09/national_guard.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-29 07:56:31.962360

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently released a report highlighting the increasing cases of gambling disorders among U.S. military service members. Despite this growing issue, the Pentagon has yet to establish effective solutions or support systems for affected personnel.

Young Service Members and Risky Gambling Behavior

The GAO report points out that younger members of the military are particularly susceptible to gambling, often driven by a tendency to take greater risks. This demographic trend raises concerns about their vulnerability to developing gambling-related problems.

Although procedures to identify and manage gambling disorders among military staff have been updated, the GAO found that no specific individual or office has been designated to lead these efforts. This lack of coordination hinders effective intervention and support for those affected.

Current Diagnosis Rates and Possible Underreporting

In 2024, there were 185 military personnel formally diagnosed with gambling disorders. However, Kristy Williams, the GAO’s Director of Defense Capabilities and Management, emphasized that this number might not fully capture the extent of the problem. Many individuals may not seek medical help, or their symptoms might not meet the official diagnostic criteria, resulting in potential underreporting.

Recommendations for Improved Support Systems

The GAO proposed nine recommendations aimed at enhancing the Pentagon’s approach to preventing, identifying, and treating gambling disorders among service members. The Defense Health Agency and various military branches are encouraged to revise their policies to better address this issue.

Funding Challenges and Lack of Preventive Measures

Financial support for programs related to service member welfare often comes from revenues generated by slot machines located at military bases outside the United States. These funds assist with morale, childcare, and infrastructure programs. However, the GAO report notes that there are no current initiatives in place at these locations to deter gambling problems or support those struggling with gambling disorders.

Key Findings on Gambling Behaviors and Mental Health

The 2024 study revealed that approximately 4.7% of surveyed personnel admitted to lying about gambling or feeling compelled to increase their bets. Among 15,039 personnel who gambled in the past year, 2.7% reported experiencing agitation related to gambling. Additionally, about half of those affected also suffered from depression, anxiety, or, in some cases, substance abuse.

Diagnosis Criteria for Gambling Disorders

To receive a diagnosis of a gambling disorder, individuals must exhibit four or five behavioral and psychological symptoms within a 12-month period. This strict criterion ensures accurate identification but may exclude those with less severe problems who still require support.",https://www.newsnet5.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gao-report-pentagon-gambling-disorders-military-preparedness.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-29 03:56:44.602224

Established in 1997 under the Balanced Budget Act, CHIP bridges a critical gap in pediatric healthcare access. Each state operates its own CHIP program with flexibility in eligibility, benefits, and cost-sharing, though all must meet federal guidelines. Coverage typically includes routine check-ups, immunizations, doctor visits, prescriptions, dental and vision care, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, and emergency care. CHIP plays a vital role in reducing the uninsured rate among children, improving health outcomes, and supporting early detection and treatment of illnesses. States may choose to expand CHIP to cover pregnant women and, in some cases, parents. Funding is provided through federal block grants, and states must contribute matching funds. Enrollment and renewal processes are streamlined to encourage participation, and outreach efforts target underserved communities. (MACPAC, 2018) The Affordable Care Act (ACA) reinforced CHIP’s importance by extending funding and aligning it with broader health reform goals. Despite periodic debates over reauthorization and funding levels, CHIP remains a cornerstone of child health policy in the U. Its success is measured not only by coverage rates but also by improved access to preventive care and reduced disparities. For families caught in the coverage gap, CHIP offers a lifeline—ensuring children receive the care they need to grow, learn, and thrive. (MACPAC, 2018) TRICARE is the U. Department of Defense’s healthcare program for active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, and their families.

(TRICARE, 2025) Coverage includes preventive care, hospitalization, mental health services, prescriptions, maternity care, and specialty services. Beneficiaries may access care through military treatment facilities or civilian networks, depending on their plan and location. TRICARE emphasizes readiness, ensuring service members are medically fit for duty while supporting dependents with quality care. It also includes dental and vision benefits, pharmacy programs, and telehealth services. Administered by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), TRICARE operates under federal regulations and contracts with private insurers to manage networks and claims. Cost-sharing varies by plan, rank, and service status, but TRICARE generally offers lower out-of-pocket costs compared to civilian insurance. The program also coordinates with Medicare for eligible retirees and provides overseas coverage for deployed personnel and families living abroad. TRICARE’s mission extends beyond treatment—it supports wellness, prevention, and continuity of care across transitions in service and retirement. As military demographics evolve, TRICARE adapts to meet emerging needs, including behavioral health and women’s health services.

Congresswoman Nancy Mace has reintroduced the Childhood Genital Mutilation Prevention Bill on Sept. 26, 2025 - a bill that would make certain gender-related medical treatments for minors a federal crime, bar federal funding and Medicare payments for them, and exclude providers who perform those treatments from Medicare participation. The measure also follows Rep. Mace’s separate push to strip TRICARE, the military’s health plan, of coverage for gender-transition care through an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2026 NDAA. Supporters say the bill makes permanent protections first ordered by President Trump; opponents warn it could criminalize medical care and prompt immediate legal fights.

What the bill would do

At its core, the bill does three things in federal law: It creates a new federal criminal offense for knowingly performing gender-related medical treatment on a minor (punishable by fines or up to 10 years in prison) It amends Medicare law to bar payment and to remove participating providers who perform such treatments It bans use of any federal funds for gender-related medical treatment of minors or for health plans that cover those services.

Source: X/Nancy Mace

Understanding nuances

The bill lists specific medical actions it treats as “gender-related medical treatment” for minors: examples include puberty blockers, exogenous cross-sex hormones, and an array of surgical procedures such as mastectomy/subcutaneous mastectomy, vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, orchiectomy, hysterectomy and others. Further, it defines what constitutes as a “minor”. It says that any individual under 18 years of age is a minor, and defines “sex” and “gender” in biological and social terms for the statute’s purposes. Those definitions determine the scope of the criminal and funding bans.

Exceptions the bill allows — narrow medical necessity carve-outs

The bill includes limited exceptions. A provider is not guilty under the criminal provision if the treatment is for a diagnosed disorder of sex development (DSD) demonstrated by genetic or biochemical testing, for irresolvably ambiguous biological sex characteristics, or to treat an infection, injury, disease or disorder caused or worsened by prior gender-related medical treatment. The bill also clarifies that a minor who seeks or receives such treatment is not criminally liable. Those exceptions are narrow and tied to defined medical conditions. Separately, the bill amends the Social Security Act to add gender-related medical treatment for minors to Medicare’s list of non-covered services and directs the Secretary to terminate enrollment of any provider who furnishes such treatments after a 90-day transition period.

Source: X/Nancy Mace

It also includes a broader prohibition: no federal funds (including trust funds) may be obligated or expended for gender-related medical treatment for minors or for health benefits that include such coverage. In short: the statute targets payment streams and program participation as well as the conduct itself.

How this links to other federal steps

Congresswoman Mace frames the bill as a legislative follow-up to President Trump’s January 2025 executive order, Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, which directed agencies to limit federal funding for certain gender-affirming services to people under 19. Mace has also filed NDAA amendments that would prohibit TRICARE from covering gender-transition care for service members and dependents - an attempt to extend the funding ban into DoD health benefits through defense legislation. Those actions are explicitly presented as complementary: executive action for immediate policy and a statute for permanence. A reintroduced bill must be referred to committee, debated, and passed by both chambers before reaching the President’s desk. While, even if the bill advances in committee, the combination of political controversy and likely litigation means any enforcement or funding changes could be tied up in courts for months or years.

However, this time the message has brought calm and good news for many families. The recent communication about Medicare and the Tricare program has brought a smile to more than one person.

The interest is significant because it affects a very specific group of citizens. These are active-duty military members, retirees, and also their immediate family members. SSA's announcement aims to clarify how they should act to access the health coverage they are entitled to.

An advance that clarifies questions for Americans: advantages of accessing Tricare

Social Security has reminded people that those who meet Medicare requirements can coordinate their coverage with Tricare. This special program offers easy access to doctors, hospitals, and treatments. The combination of both services ensures solid support in medical care.

Tricare covers several categories of people. Active-duty military members, retirees, family members, and also members of the National Guard and Reservists are included. All of them have benefits that expand if Medicare Parts A and B are activated correctly.

SSA's message insists that enrollment is key. In order to enjoy Tricare For Life, beneficiaries must have both of those Medicare parts active. Otherwise, they would lose a highly valued health support in the United States.

How to enroll and what to know before doing so

Enrollment is not complicated, but it does require attention. SSA explains that people must be officially enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. Once this is done, the Tricare program is activated automatically for those who meet the requirements.

The process aims to ensure that beneficiaries do not have gaps in their coverage. Coordination between Medicare and Tricare prevents unnecessary expenses and makes medical care easier. Program clients greatly value that peace of mind, especially during delicate health moments.

The opinions of those enrolled are very positive. Many highlight that the combination of Medicare and Tricare gives them financial and medical security. Others emphasize that it is a real relief to know that their families will be protected without complicated procedures.

SSA sums up its message in a simple idea: take advantage of what is already available. Enrolling on time in the correct Medicare parts opens the door to a huge benefit like Tricare For Life. That's why thousands of people in the United States have received the news with euphoria and gratitude.",https://catalunyadiari.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/montaje-bandera-estados-unidos-jubilados_1200_800.webp,N,1.0,2025-09-28 06:56:23.695428

“TRICARE covers National Guard and Reserve members injured while in qualified duty status (under 30 days) through line of duty care,” said James Whitton, Chief, Military Medical Support Office at the Defense Health Agency. “LOD care covers treatment of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty if a LOD determination is approved.”

This article explores how, where, and under what circumstances National Guard and Reserve members can get LOD care.

How Does LOD care work?

If a National Guard or Reserve member is injured or becomes ill while on qualified duty status for 30 days or less, treatment may qualify under LOD care. This includes injury, illness, or disease that’s incurred or aggravated while on qualified duty status.

To qualify for LOD care, the injury or illness must be military-service related. LOD may also include injury or illness while traveling to or from a duty station.

What should you keep in mind?

TRICARE limits LOD treatment for a specific condition to one year from the date of your diagnosis. If you still need care after one year, you may be referred to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System.

If you have any non-service related or preexisting health conditions, they won’t be covered under LOD care unless documentation indicates that the condition was aggravated as result of military-related duty.

LOD care isn’t a government lifetime health plan.

LOD care isn’t available to family members.

Where can I get LOD care?

LOD care is available both in the U.S. and overseas. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you live.

In the U.S.:

A military hospital or clinic or the Military Medical Support Office at Defense Health Agency—Great Lakes can authorize your LOD care.

Overseas:

A military hospital or clinic or International SOS, the TRICARE Overseas contractor, can authorize your LOD care.

What happens once you get an authorization for LOD care? You can get care one of two ways:

If you live within 50 miles or one hour’s drive time of a military hospital or clinic, you must get your treatment there.

If you live remotely—more than 50 miles or one hour’s drive time from a military hospital or clinic—the MMSO will provide an authorization to the regional contractor so you can get care from a civilian provider. This includes care for both physical and mental health conditions.

These options apply in both the U.S. and overseas. However, if you’re a Reserve Component member stationed overseas:

MMSO doesn’t validate LOD status for you, except in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The TRICARE Overseas contractor can authorize your remote care from a host nation provider. They can also help you book your appointment.

Do you need emergency care or urgent care?

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. If you need urgent care, go to an appropriate urgent care facility. It’s important to know that emergency or urgent care isn’t a “one-off.” You need to meet LOD criteria, so you can get LOD urgent or emergency care without paying out of pocket.

Other tips for getting LOD care

Are you wondering what you need to get care? You’ll need to show proof of drill status, such as a muster form or Inactive Duty Training orders. This helps ensure a smooth LOD determination.

You’ll also need to ask your unit to submit DHA–GL Worksheet-01: Medical Eligibility Verification along with a unit sign-in sheet, muster form, or a copy of certified orders. Your submission must also include the urgent or emergency care medical notes. Your service unit must send this information to the MMSO as soon as possible after you get care.

Important: If you’re getting care under a LOD determination, do NOT use personal health insurance.

How do I submit LOD claims and view authorizations?

As detailed in the TRICARE Choices for National Guard and Reserve Handbook, your service Military Medical Authority determines your LOD status. However, you’ll submit claims to your regional contractor. Be sure to sign up to access your regional contractor’s secure beneficiary portal:

East Region (Humana Military)

West Region (TriWest Healthcare Alliance)

For other issues, such as primary eligibility in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System or incorrect claims processing, contact the MMSO or your military hospital or clinic:

What about LOD dental care and pharmacy coverage?

What happens if you have a dental injury or illness while you’re activated for 30 days or less? You may qualify for LOD dental care. Be sure to have your service complete an LOD determination. Your commander or designated representative must sign the determination. Send it by email or mail to the dental contractor, United Concordia.

If your provider prescribes LOD-related drug for your LOD-related injury or illness, you can fill your prescription at a:

Military pharmacy

TRICARE retail network pharmacy

You won’t have any out-of-pocket expenses if you get your prescription at a military pharmacy. But you will pay upfront at a TRICARE retail network pharmacy and file a claim for reimbursement. Do you have questions about or need help filing for reimbursement? You can find detailed instructions, or call the MMSO at 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676), option 2.

What’s Happening:

Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

Details:

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

Next Steps:

If you are a long-term stockholder of Zynex, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

By Kevin Larson

The daily joy of a family meal turned into an emergency room visit, surgery, and an overnight hospital stay for retired Sergeant First Class Damien Dunn, a Soldier for Life and Winn Army Community Hospital beneficiary.

“I’m eating dinner, and I was feeling pain in my kidneys,” Dunn said. “I didn’t know what it was and I tried to let that passover, but my wife said just go to the ER.”

Dunn did the next morning, arriving at Winn’s emergency department. The healthcare team sprang into action, triaging him and charting the way ahead.

“They admitted me, ran some blood tests, ran a CT scan, then they figured out that my appendix was possibly ruptured, so I was going to have emergency surgery,” Dunn said.

Dr. Christina McCain, a general surgeon at Winn, was the doctor who performed Dunn’s appendectomy. She told him “we’re going to take care of you,” and Dunn said those words were comforting.

“I’d never had any surgeries before, but from ER into pre-op…I had full faith and confidence,” he said.

Assessing a patient’s condition quickly and determining the best treatment plan is critical, McCain said, especially in a situation like Dunn’s. Equally important, though, is establishing the rapport and trust Dunn found comforting, something McCain does with everyone she sees.

“I have always treated my patients like I would treat my own family,” she said.

After the ED prepared Dunn for the handoff, he noticed how smoothly the transition went. The teamwork between the units was remarkable.

“They moved as one cohesive unit,” he said. “They passed information from one person to another and then following up, making sure that post surgery that I was being take care of, whether taking vitals, making sure my meds are being taken care of, and checking blood pressure. They definitely have a real good team here.”

Dunn met certified registered nurse anesthesiologist Capt. Joseph Mazzarella at the pre-op area after being moved from the ED. Mazzarella and his team had been preparing to go home after reaching the end of scheduled surgeries for the day. That changed when they got word Dunn was in need of emergency surgery.

“We immediately did what we always did, go into action and get ready to go,” Mazzarella said. “We have a multidisciplinary team here at Winn to ensure the transitions from emergency room to the pre op area, to the operating room and to the inpatient care ward, are all smooth. We're a small hospital here, or community hospital, so it's very important that we all know each other. We're one team here.”

Before leaving the ED, an anesthesia teammate went to Dunn for a pre-check. Once he arrived at pre-op, Mazzarella did more checks, determining what levels of anesthesia were appropriate for Dunn factoring in specific things that came up as they talked.

“Mr. Dunn he looks like a big, tough guy, but when you talk to him, just soft, spoken, very friendly,” Mazzarella said.”He's had a 20 year experience in the army. I heard all about some of his experiences in the military, how that's affected him, and just taking that into consideration, I gave him the best care.”

The care Dunn received continued after he was discharged. McCain reached out to him, and he also took an opportunity to visit with Mazzarella. All those interactions gave him “a nice warm and fuzzy,” and built a camaraderie.

“Once a Soldier, always a Soldier,” Dunn said. “I felt like a tight knit family has been built. Moving forward, I’ll always keep that mindset, that I’ll always be taken care of, and know that my sisters and brothers will always be taken care of, whether in uniform or out of uniform.”

Knowing Winn is ready to take care of retirees like him while also ensuring the health of warfighters is reassuring to Dunn. His experience showed him the hospital goes above and beyond, not only in his case, but all beneficiaries, he said.

“I’m definitely grateful,” Dunn said. “I wouldn’t second guess coming back here for any treatments.”

With more than 30,000 Soldiers and other beneficiaries in the immediate are served by Winn, providing care for all of them ensures the Army’s lethality, Mazzarella said.

“Readiness starts with the warfighter,” he said. “Whether it’s here at Winn or downrange in an austere environment—we’re always ready to provide the best care.”

As the daughter of an Air Force veteran, McCain understands the need to provide healthcare for warfighters, retirees and families. It’s an honor to provide care at Winn, she said, both for retirees who made sacrifices for our freedoms and to keep warfighters reassured about their families’ health so they stay focused one the mission.

“They deserve exceptional care and I am humbled to be a part of this superb care team,” McCain said.

Col. Margaret Berryman, Winn director and Fort Stewart U.S. Army Medical Department Activity commander, echoed the importance of ensuring readiness by providing healthcare for the warfighters while also carrying for families and retirees like Dunn.

""Taking care of our retirees and families is a vital part of what we do,” Berryman said “It's a key part of our mission of warfighter readiness. Our Soldiers need to know their families are receiving safe, quality care so they can focus on their training and deployment. We owe our retirees this same level of commitment, honoring their service by providing them with the best healthcare.""",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Sep/26/2003809146/1920/1080/0/250916-O-TY372-3095.JPG,N,0.0,2025-09-26 23:56:42.836017
