My Dad thank goodness had part A for cancer treatment. He did cancel part B to save some money. The part A paid for a rehab place.

We live on base right now and use the base pharmacy for most of my meds.
The base pharmacy here is small and can’t always get my meds quickly so it’s just easier to go off base.
On a side note…needing medical care is not being a “leech”.
You, like everyone else, deserves proper medical care.","There are 2 main levels of tricare: prime and select.

Prime: free if overseas, minimal cost if stateside (someone correct me if I'm wrong). You don't everything through your pcp and need a referral for everything. That can get super annoying/frustrating. The tradeoff is no co-pays ever.

Select: you never need a referral, but there are co-pays. If living stateside, but remote, this is the better option.

As far as diabetic supplies, when I had gestational diabetes, they didn't cover the cost of my glucometer since it's an iver the counter thing, but reading their website, they should cover a cgm if necessary. I also had a copay on insulin and supplies to check my levels. I have select, so that may have been part of the reason.

Tricare is really cheap for insurance (we pay less than $300/months for a family of 5) and the coverage is great for the price. I have never had anything denied that was medically necessary, but i have had it take forever to get approved. I have had to fight to get the doctors I wanted, but they've always been approved in the end. Sometimes you have to do the work for tricare because they dont always update their database of doctors. I was assigned a doctor once that had retired 2 years earlier.

Vision and dental are separate, but still super cheap.

I’m a very high utilizer and can tell you that tricare prime, as long as you have the right referrals and documentation, covers absolutely almost everything and costs us $0 as long as my husband is active duty. Prescriptions filled off base but still within network costs $16. I was medically retired before I married my husband (who is still active duty) and had tricare select. I had a $3000 catastrophic cap and I hit that every year due to my chronic illness.

I am also a type 1 diabetic and 100% of my supplies are available on base, through the pharmacy, with zero cost to me. If you use Express Scripts, the mail order, then there is usually a copay. The only limits when it comes to covered meds is that anything identified as a maintenance medication(diabetic supplies are) is required to be filled on base or through mail order or you have to pay a higher copay. We live on base right now and use the base pharmacy for most of my meds. Our last base I used express scrips.

As I mentioned, I’m a very high utilizer due to my chronic illness and I am in palliative care. I have a large amount of medical supplies and specialty medications that are all fully covered. I do pay a copay for my palliative meds because they’re filled through a local specialty pharmacy. The base pharmacy here is small and can’t always get my meds quickly so it’s just easier to go off base. My medical supplies for my port, tube feeding, IV, etc is all covered 100%. I have a home nurse and aides that are all paid by tricare. My specialists are all covered as long as they’re in network and I’ve never had a hard time finding amazing doctors who take tricare.

Honestly, it sometimes takes some effort but ultimately everything we need has been covered. It’s just about making sure you have the right paperwork and getting it pushed through.

As someone else said, you will also need to enroll in EFMP. It’s a program to insure your spouse isn’t sent to a base that won’t have proper services for you. In your case, needing an endocrinologist will be the requirement so it shouldn’t be a huge issue getting assignments. EFMP is not optional and you do have to enroll but it’s for your benefit.

On a side note…needing medical care is not being a “leech”. Having a chronic illness isn’t a moral failing. You, like everyone else, deserves proper medical care.

If you or anyone else have any questions then I’m absolutely happy to answer from my experience. I’ve been using tricare for my medical care almost my entire life and got sick while I was active duty myself so I’m well versed in what care is available. I’m very lucky to have this and always want to make sure others get the proper care they need too.",,N,0.0,2025-07-05 18:56:19.989413

Yes, Tricare covers HRT which includes TRT with some exclusions. See your Primary Care Manager for a referral if you have Prime. If you have Select you can go to a Specialist without a referral. It depends on how the Specialist decides you need care. If your problem falls under the issues included in the things that are covered then yes, Tricare pays.If its not, they won't. This is determined when the doctor bills Tricare. Now, when they ask for preauthorization, they will send in a request, permission to perform this thing. They will get approved or denied based on their codes which tell Tricare what they will be doing. Ensure they use the correct codes because they often send the wrong ones and you get denied because your doctor input the wrong code, or even the wrong information somewhere else on the referral or preauth.",,N,0.0,2025-07-05 15:56:22.249731

Ona Treatment Center implements a clinical program that adheres to guidelines established by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), which emphasizes treatment plans tailored to the individual's needs and regularly adjusted.

ASAM-based treatment plans include both detoxification services and a 28-day dual-diagnosis residential treatment program, which addresses both substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions simultaneously. This integrated approach equips clients with necessary skills for long-term recovery from alcohol and substance use disorders.

The dual-diagnosis treatment model recognizes that many individuals struggling with alcohol use also experience mental health challenges that require concurrent treatment.

Ona Treatment Center's location also aids in the recovery of military personnel. The facility is on a 250-sqm secluded property close to nature, which makes it conducive for counseling, meditation, group therapy, and other activities that assist in recovery.

-- Addiction Resource Center (ARC) is proud to announce the launch of its TRICARE-approved Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) in Yuba City, specifically designed to support active duty military personnel struggling with alcohol use disorders. This program offers evidence-based care tailored to meet the unique demands of military life—allowing service members to maintain responsibilities while actively engaging in treatment and recovery.

Further details can be found at https://sayarc.com/services/tricare-approved-iop/

Alcohol misuse remains a serious concern within the military community. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Defense, nearly one in three active-duty service members were classified as engaging in hazardous drinking or possible alcohol use disorder in recent years. The pressures of deployment, reintegration, trauma, and military culture can all contribute to increased alcohol consumption—and effective, accessible care is essential to long-term recovery.

ARC’s TRICARE-approved IOP addresses this need with a flexible and clinically robust treatment structure. Clients typically attend 3 to 5 sessions per week, including individual counseling, group therapy, and educational workshops. Sessions are scheduled around work shifts, family commitments, and duty rosters, ensuring that service members can participate in treatment without compromising their roles in their units or homes.

“Our goal is to make high-quality, culturally competent care available to those who serve,” said a spokesperson for Addiction Resource Center. “We understand the challenges faced by military personnel—whether it’s the stigma of asking for help, the unpredictability of schedules, or the weight of unseen trauma. That’s why we’ve created a program that is flexible, supportive, and directly aligned with their lived experience.”

ARC’s IOP is rooted in evidence-based treatment methods proven to support long-term sobriety and relapse prevention. The program includes trauma-informed care, PTSD support, and military-focused therapy facilitated by clinicians who have experience working with service members.

In addition to clinical services, ARC offers family support, recognizing that successful recovery often involves strengthening the home environment and support systems around the client.

One of the key benefits of this program is TRICARE coverage, which means that active duty members, veterans, and their families may access care with no out-of-pocket costs. ARC staff assist with benefit verification and provide a smooth admissions process to minimize barriers to entry.

The following charts outline basic TRICARE costs by option and beneficiary category: Story by Douglas J. Gillert, American Forces Press Service","With TRICARE now up and running worldwide, every eligible DoD health care beneficiary has to answer one question: Which care option is right for me?

The DoD health plan offers three primary choices: Prime, Extra and Standard. Under these exist various other options, but your first choice has to be one of these three. If you're an active duty service member, you are automatically enrolled at no cost in TRICARE Prime. If you're an active duty family member, military retiree or retiree family member, you must enroll to get into Prime. If you don't select the Prime option, you still can use any combination of benefits under Extra and Standard. Neither requires enrollment.

Health care officials said you should consider carefully each option before deciding what's best for you. Factors to consider include costs, services available in your area and other health insurance programs you may already be enrolled in.

Here's an overview of each option:

TRICARE Prime

In this plan, most of your health care, including prescription medicine, comes from a military treatment facility, augmented by a local network of preferred providers. You'll be assigned to a primary care manager -- a physician or group of health care providers who supervise your care.

Your primary care manager will provide all nonemergency medical care and refer you to medical specialists as needed. Active duty family members also can enroll in Prime at no cost, and your copayments are lower than under the other two options. Eligible retirees and their families may enroll in Prime at a cost of $230 a year for one person or $460 for more than one.

Enrollment in Prime limits your choice of who will provide your health care. However, where Prime is available, it provides members distinct advantages of guaranteed appointments, away-from-home coverage and smaller fees per visit (no fee for active duty members) to authorized civilian providers than under Extra or Standard.

TRICARE Extra

You don't enroll in Extra. You have to pay CHAMPUS deductibles, and other CHAMPUS rules apply as well. You must select an authorized civilian network provider and make copayments for care received that equal 15 percent of the negotiated fee.

Advantages to Extra include no enrollment fee, no deductibles when you use the retail pharmacy network and no forms to file. On the downside, you have only a limited choice of providers and you pay deductibles and copayments. You may need a nonavailability statement from the military hospital nearest you before receiving inpatient care in a civilian hospital.

TRICARE Standard

Remember CHAMPUS? This is it, under a new name. CHAMPUS rules and costs apply. You don't enroll for Standard either. Treat the Extra and Standard options as interchangeable and use the one best for you in a given instance.

Standard's advantages are it gives you the broadest choice of providers and it's widely available. However, in addition to the CHAMPUS deductible and copayments, you will be charged for the balance of your medical bill if it exceeds allowable charges and the provider doesn't participate in Standard but agrees to bill Standard for the care provided. As with Extra, you may need a nonavailability statement from the military hospital nearest you before receiving inpatient care in a civilian hospital.

For more in-depth information about TRICARE, visit the TRICARE Service Center in your area, visit the TRICARE home page on the World Wide Web at http://www.ha.osd.mil, or contact the health benefits adviser at any military medical treatment facility.

""The Department of Defense immediately initiated vaccination of selected service members,"" he noted.
While military service members are healthier than the general public, our experience should serve as a guide to the civilian community, and you should take this message back home.""
You also enrolled more than 100,000 seniors into TRICARE Plus, providing a health system far superior to the previous 'space-available runaround.'""
In a final note on TRICARE, Winkenwerder said new contracts were released during summer 2002 that will change the way the program is administered -- for the better.","Noting that the nation is experiencing ""very serious times,"" Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, told more than 3,000 attendees at the National TRICARE Conference that ""there's much to be done in the coming year across the military health system.""

Winkenwerder pointed out that, ""Tens of thousands of Americans have deployed to the Gulf region; families have bid farewell to their loved ones from almost every naval harbor in the country; 37,000 American soldiers are sitting on point at Camp Bonifas at the Demilitarized Zone and throughout the Korean Peninsula; our reserve component service members continue to join their active duty counterparts in significant numbers as one fighting force.""

He noted that military medical professionals at last year's conference set four major goals for the military health system: to improve force health protection and readiness; improve TRICARE; further outreach, coordination and collaboration; and to improve provider recruitment and retention.

Reflecting on performances in achieving these goals and outlining what needs to be done this year, the secretary said, ""The most important step we took in 2002 was to restart a strategic planning and governance process for the entire military health system.""

Crediting the surgeons general and senior DoD leaders with spending a lot of time putting together a shared vision and strategy for the coming years, Winkenwerder said, ""We took a fresh look at what it is we do, those we service, and the values that our service represents and then redefined what is expected of us.

""Much has been accomplished,"" he added. This, he said, includes the resumption of the anthrax vaccination and initiation of smallpox immunizations.

DoD's top doctor emphasized that only a few critics remain since anthrax vaccinations were resumed in June 2002. ""Bad information has been beaten by a military force, including a DoD leadership, better informed about the threats posed by biological agents and a communications effort that has been second to none,"" he said.

Winkenwerder stood with President Bush on Dec. 13, 2002, when the president announced smallpox vaccinations for military members and first responders in the civilian medical community.

""The Department of Defense immediately initiated vaccination of selected service members,"" he noted. ""As a physician, I know that the smallpox vaccine has a risk profile that merits heightened awareness. But as your assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, I know that our experience with this vaccine sets a standard for safety for the rest of the country and the world. There's no other medical system in the country or on the planet with the documented experience and successful outcomes that we have.""

From 1945 to 1990, DoD immunized millions of service members against smallpox and didn't experience any deaths, the doctor emphasized.

""How?"" he asked, then answered, ""With great professional attention and the finest basic medical care -- careful screening before vaccination and close monitoring after the sticks. While military service members are healthier than the general public, our experience should serve as a guide to the civilian community, and you should take this message back home.""

To critics who argue that the threat isn't clear, therefore, the vaccination program isn't necessary, Winkenwerder said, ""I can' tell you whether the likelihood of a smallpox attack is 1/10th of 1 percent or 75 percent, but we know that the former Soviet Union weaponized smallpox and produced it in significant quantities.

""We don't know if it's all accounted for,"" he said. ""Others may also have produced and stored it.""

Consequently, Winkenwerder said, DoD made the right choice in taking pre-emptive action to protect American troops. ""We've attacked and neutralized the top two biological threats against the forces of freedom,"" he said. ""But the work doesn't end with vaccination against anthrax and smallpox. We have much more to do in the coming year to improve protection against a number of biological, chemical and other threats from weapons of mass destruction.""

The secretary said the successes were significant in the improvement of TRICARE. Last year's successes include kicking off the TRICARE for Life benefit, fixing computer glitches, and data sharing with Medicare. As a result, he said, ""the TRICARE for Life program truly represents and industry benchmark for how to reach out to consumers, including sitting down with people, ""one-by-one and telling them how their benefits work.

""This is about trust,"" he continued, ""and you restored that trust. You also enrolled more than 100,000 seniors into TRICARE Plus, providing a health system far superior to the previous 'space-available runaround.'""

Winkenwerder told the audience that quality improvement in TRICARE and patient safety are paramount. More than 50,000 potentially life-threatening adverse drug interactions were prevented in the Pharmacy Data Transaction Service.

""It's fast, accurate and saves lives,"" he said.

""Another program we're closely monitoring is the TRICARE On-Line initiative,"" the secretary said. ""We're out in front of much of the industry on providing our enrollees and other beneficiaries with quality Web-based support. In the year ahead, we'll deploy TRICARE On-Line to almost all of our military treatment facilities.""

The secretary also said TRICARE is launching an obstetrics initiative. ""Congress has amended nonavailability statement requirements for women not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, providing expanded patient choice,"" the doctor said. ""We have a story to tell about the high-quality of our obstetric care and about the customer-oriented services we pledge to deliver.""

He said DoD is studying the possibility for patients to e-mail and consult electronically with their healthcare providers.

In a final note on TRICARE, Winkenwerder said new contracts were released during summer 2002 that will change the way the program is administered -- for the better. This includes simplifying administration, increasing accountability and improving customer service. TRICARE is also moving from seven contracts to three contracts and from 11 regions in the U.S. to three regions.

""Every one of the issues I raised here is about our leadership responsibility -- greater accountability for performance in quality and optimized facilities; greater simplicity in management and patient administration; and in patients that are pleased with getting their care from their military health system,"" Winkenwerder said.

""Our beneficiaries also have expectations that their private medical information is secure,"" he said. Winkenwerder said DoD is tightening security and accountability for all sensitive information, particularly health information.

""We must remember that here in the Department of Defense, electronic and physical security is required to protect our patients, and to promote national security,"" he said. ""We all have responsibilities.""

If you do not decide to sign up for it, after a certain amount of time, there’s no going back.
My wife who never served is currently on Medicare and tfl the only thing I’ve paid for is her rx every threee months.
In order for my wife to get access to tfl I had to sign up and pay a monthly premium for Tricare prime.
If you are satisfied with the VA and use it for your health care there's probably no point.","If you ever wanna use Medicare, I highly recommend that you have the $180 deducted from your Social Security check to pay for Medicare part B. If you do not decide to sign up for it, after a certain amount of time, there’s no going back. I’d highly recommend that you check with a professional on this.

I am pretty sure you have tri care for life since you are a retired military...my friend who is retired air force was telling me that while we were both in the doctors office , he had his three choices still VA, Tri-care and Medicare and he and his wife whom he was waiting on while we were having this conversation were in their 70's...I would however recommend that you do opt in for Medicare when the time comes. Through him and through others, having told me it has been a major blessing at various times...I would talk to knowledge base here for any and all specifics of each...but yes if you want all three the options are there for you...I wish I was wise and stayed in so I could have my military retirement and your options, it's blessing to many I know...you deserve it

To get/keep TFL you will have to sign up for Medicare at 65 (you will also get a new forever retired ID)- if you don't sign up for Medicare and do so later, hefty penalty. You will keep eligibility for free at VA. I use Medicare for most things and VA for eyes/ears -- I assume you either have Prime or standard/Select Tricare currently

At your rating, your VA medical/health care is free for life...I am still employed and have employer provided health insurance, which in no way affects my VA health benefits/care...so essentially for the time being I have my low cost employer health coverage AND my VA health care (which is not to be confused with 'insurance'). In your case, your option would be having Medicare at a cost AND your free VA Healthcare

Like others have said yes you will have to pay for Medicare out of your social security. That said you can also enroll in Tricare for life which wraps around Medicare. Additionally you can sign up for a Medicare advantage plan that you don’t pay for but in turn it gets paid for by Medicare and gives you money back at no additional cost!

This is exactly what I’m planning on doing next year when I turn 65. My wife who never served is currently on Medicare and tfl the only thing I’ve paid for is her rx every threee months. Also tfl has an option for overseas applications free of charge! In order for my wife to get access to tfl I had to sign up and pay a monthly premium for Tricare prime. Im currently at 60 percent and retired.

Dm me if you need further details.

Bottom line it’s worth it !

There is no requirement to sign up for medicare.

You should sign up for medicare part A which covers hospitalization and does not cost anything because it was paid for by deductions from your pay during the time you worked.

You can sign up for Part B which is totally voluntary and requires a monthly payment, but as you are totally covered by the VA that is a financial decision for you to make. If you are satisfied with the VA and use it for your health care there's probably no point. If you do not sign up for Part B when eligible, and later decide you want coverage there's a 2% penalty for every year you didn't get the coverage.",,N,0.0,2025-07-04 14:56:26.832143

Osukoya, a Nigerian citizen and the owner of Ayo Biometrics, LLC, operating under the name Cambridge Diagnostics, is accused of conspiring to commit health care fraud by recruiting individuals with private and public health insurance plans to undergo electroencephalogram (EEG) testing.
Prosecutors allege that he paid illegal kickbacks and bribes to physicians and others to secure patient referrals for the testing.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Renee Hunter is prosecuting the case in the Northern District of Texas.
An indictment is an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.","A Nigerian national, Olatunbosun Osukoya, 67, of Plano, Texas, has been charged by indictment in the United States for allegedly participating in a scheme to defraud federal health care programmes through the submission of more than $25 million in fraudulent claims.

The indictment against Osukoya was announced on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a nationwide healthcare fraud takedown that resulted in criminal charges against 324 individuals across 50 federal districts. The operation targeted schemes involving a total of over $14.6 billion in alleged intended losses.

Osukoya, a Nigerian citizen and the owner of Ayo Biometrics, LLC, operating under the name Cambridge Diagnostics, is accused of conspiring to commit health care fraud by recruiting individuals with private and public health insurance plans to undergo electroencephalogram (EEG) testing.

Prosecutors allege that he paid illegal kickbacks and bribes to physicians and others to secure patient referrals for the testing.

To support the claims, Osukoya and unnamed co-conspirators allegedly falsified diagnoses and misrepresented the kickback payments as legitimate business expenses, such as loans, medical directorships, and consultation fees.

According to the indictment, Cambridge Diagnostics received over $5 million in payments from Medicare, TRICARE, and other insurance providers as a result of the alleged fraudulent submissions.

Osukoya is also accused of paying over $450,000 in illegal kickbacks to facilitate the scheme.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Dallas Field Office and the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Renee Hunter is prosecuting the case in the Northern District of Texas.

In a statement, Acting U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson for the Northern District of Texas said, “These individuals lined their own pockets, egregiously stealing beneficiaries’ identities and pillaging the coffers of federal programs. We will never tolerate this behaviour and will relentlessly pursue prosecution of these offenders to the fullest extent possible.”The broader operation, referred to as the 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, saw the seizure of over $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency, and other assets across the United States. According to the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), over $4 billion in fraudulent payments were prevented, and 205 providers had their billing privileges suspended or revoked in advance of the operation.

Commenting on the national effort, Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated, “This record-setting Health Care Fraud Takedown delivers justice to criminal actors who prey upon our most vulnerable citizens and steal from hardworking American taxpayers.”

The charges against Osukoya form part of the Department of Justice’s ongoing initiative to dismantle complex healthcare fraud schemes and recover funds stolen from government programmes.

“Earning the distinction of the most awarded plant in the world is no small feat — it reflects the relentless quality mindset our team brings to every vehicle, every day,” said Frank Voss, outgoing President of TMMC, in a statement.

J.D. Power’s study includes 2025 model year vehicles bought or leased between March 2024 and February 2025. Buyers own the vehicles for 90 days following their purchase before completing the survey. TMMC said plant awards are based on the lowest number of customer-reported defect/malfunction problems per vehicle.

TMMC said this top award is shared with Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, and is the twelfth award for its South Plant.

EEG testing is a diagnostic test that involves measuring the electricity activity in the brain using sensitive equipment.
According to the charge sheet, Osukoya, the manager of Cambridge Diagnostics, allegedly committed the healthcare fraud between 2020 and 2023 using the company.
“Additionally, Osukoya encouraged the physicians to refer their own patients to Cambridge Diagnostics for EEG testing.
“Once Osukoya confirmed the insurer would pay, Osukoya performed a routine EEG on the patient and would then instruct the coconspirator physician to order ambulatory EEG testing.","The US government has preferred charges against Olatunbosun Osukoya, a Nigerian man, over alleged involvement in a $25 million healthcare fund scam.

Osukoya was indicted in “connection with the submission of over $25 million in false and fraudulent medical claims to Medicare, TRICARE, and other insurers for electroencephalogram (EEG) testing”.

EEG testing is a diagnostic test that involves measuring the electricity activity in the brain using sensitive equipment.

A statement published on Tuesday by the US justice department said Osukoya was part of the 324 defendants it had preferred charges against in the 2025 national health care fraud takedown.

The US justice department said the defendants allegedly participated in “various health care fraud schemes involving over $14.6 billion in intended loss”.

The defendants include 96 doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and other medical professions across the US.

The US justice department filed a one-count charge bordering on conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud against Osukoya.

According to the charge sheet, Osukoya, the manager of Cambridge Diagnostics, allegedly committed the healthcare fraud between 2020 and 2023 using the company.

“As part of the scheme and artifice to defraud, Osukoya sought out individuals with insurance plans to undergo expensive ambulatory EEG testing through Cambridge Diagnostics,” part of the charge sheet reads.

“To incentivize individuals to undergo the testing, Osukoya offered to pay, and did pay, kickbacks and bribes in varying amounts, typically between $500 and $2000.

“Osukoya also sought out a network of physicians, including Coconspirator One and Coconspirator Two, and others, to order EEG testing through Cambridge Diagnostics.

“Osukoya sent individuals he directly recruited to these physicians to order the testing.

“Additionally, Osukoya encouraged the physicians to refer their own patients to Cambridge Diagnostics for EEG testing.

“In return for referring patients, Osukoya promised to pay, and did pay, kickbacks and bribes to physicians and their representatives in the form of a percentage of the reimbursement Cambridge Diagnostics received from the claims.

“Before any testing was performed, Osukoya sent the individual’s insurance information to his ‘biller’, to ensure Cambridge Diagnostics would receive reimbursement for the claim.

“Osukoya targeted individuals with out-of-network benefits that would reimburse higher for the tests and avoided benefit plans that were known to pay little or nothing for the tests.

“If the patient had no insurance or did not have insurance that covered the testing, the testing was not performed.

“Once Osukoya confirmed the insurer would pay, Osukoya performed a routine EEG on the patient and would then instruct the coconspirator physician to order ambulatory EEG testing.

“To conceal the fraudulent billing scheme and to justify payment for the testing. Osukoya and his co-conspirators frequently listed false or exaggerated diagnoses to make it appear that the service was medically necessary, when in fact, it was not.

“For instance, Osukoya and his co-conspirators would falsely represent that the patient had epilepsy or seizures when the patient had no such condition.”",https://www.thecable.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/judge-gavel-court-e1634298698292.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-04 12:56:26.702876

The DOJ said the defendants include 96 doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and other licensed medical professionals.
Osukoya, owner of Ayo Biometrics, LLC, which operates as Cambridge Diagnostics, was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud.
Authorities said Cambridge Diagnostics received over $5 million in payments for the claims, with Osukoya allegedly disbursing more than $450,000 in illegal kickbacks.
Osukoya’s indictment is part of a broader federal crackdown on healthcare fraud, which U.S. officials say continues to strain public resources and endanger patients.","The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicted a Nigerian, Olatunbosun Osukoya, in connection with a sweeping healthcare fraud operation valued at over $14.6 billion in intended losses described as one of the largest in US history.

Osukoya, 67, who resides in Plano, Texas, was among 324 individuals charged in the 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown spanning 50 federal districts and 12 State Attorneys General’s Offices across the United States. The DOJ said the defendants include 96 doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and other licensed medical professionals.

In a statement released on Thursday, the DOJ disclosed that the alleged perpetrators “exploited patients and taxpayers” through various schemes involving fraudulent claims and medically unnecessary procedures.

“The Justice Department today announced the results of its 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, which resulted in criminal charges against 324 defendants… involving over $14.6 billion in intended loss,” the statement read.

Osukoya, owner of Ayo Biometrics, LLC, which operates as Cambridge Diagnostics, was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud. According to court documents, he is accused of submitting more than $25 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare, TRICARE, and other insurers, primarily for electroencephalogram (EEG) testing.

The DOJ said Osukoya actively sought out individuals with insurance plans for costly lab testing and paid kickbacks to medical professionals to funnel patients to his diagnostic center.

“As alleged in the indictment, Osukoya… sought out individuals with insurance plans to undergo expensive EEG testing and recruited and paid kickbacks and bribes to physicians and others to refer patients to Cambridge Diagnostics,” the DOJ stated.

To disguise the illicit nature of the transactions, the indictment alleges that Osukoya and his co-conspirators falsified diagnoses and misrepresented illegal payments as legitimate business expenses — labelling them as loans, medical directorships, and consultation fees.

“To conceal the scheme and to make it appear that the services were necessary… kickback payments were falsely labelled,” the DOJ added.

Authorities said Cambridge Diagnostics received over $5 million in payments for the claims, with Osukoya allegedly disbursing more than $450,000 in illegal kickbacks.

Osukoya’s indictment is part of a broader federal crackdown on healthcare fraud, which U.S. officials say continues to strain public resources and endanger patients.

Meanwhile, in a related development, another Nigerian, Newton Ofioritse Jemide, was sentenced to three years and five months in prison by Judge Deborah K. Chasanow of a U.S. District Court.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Arkansas Act 624 into law, she put access to medications at risk for the thousands of active-duty and retired military service members living in Arkansas.
This law will have life-threatening consequences for thousands of Arkansas military beneficiaries and many other Arkansans who get their medications through a home-delivery specialty pharmacy.
If this goes forward or other states follow Arkansas' lead, expect catastrophic consequences for millions of military beneficiaries.
U.S. Army Col. Douglas House (retired) is an attorney and a former Arkansas state representative.","I have dedicated my life to service of my country, Arkansas, and our veterans. I always strive to ensure that our eligible active, reserve, National Guard warriors, veterans, military retirees, and their families receive the medical care promised by Congress for their service. However, Arkansas is about to implement a law that will deny them--and thousands of other patients--access to their prescription medicines.

Health coverage for military members is managed by the Department of Defense's TRICARE program. It is important to have TRICARE's pharmacy benefits supported by a national company to ensure that active-duty military members can get their medications reliably and affordably, no matter where they are.

Like many large employers and other health plans, TRICARE contracts with the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts and its affiliate specialty pharmacy Accredo. Express Scripts sends prescribed medications to beneficiaries for common medical conditions like high blood pressure. Accredo ships specialty medications such as chemotherapy or biologics for medical conditions such as cancers, blood diseases, and inflammatory organ diseases, which are generally more complex and expensive. Most of these medicines are not stocked by neighborhood pharmacies because they require specific temperature controls and other special handling that they can't afford to provide.

But when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Arkansas Act 624 into law, she put access to medications at risk for the thousands of active-duty and retired military service members living in Arkansas. The law requires the state Pharmacy Board to revoke existing pharmacy licenses and refuse to issue licenses to PBMs that also maintain pharmacies, including congressionally mandated and TRICARE-contracted PBMs and pharmacies. Governor Sanders may claim ignorance of the effect of this law, but I personally delivered a letter to her office warning her about them before she signed the bill.

This law will have life-threatening consequences for thousands of Arkansas military beneficiaries and many other Arkansans who get their medications through a home-delivery specialty pharmacy. Not only in Arkansas, but if other states pass similar legislation as Governor Sanders is urging, military beneficiaries scattered or retired across our country where there is no military base or a full-service pharmacy would be at risk.

I am no friend of PBMs. As a state representative, I supported laws to bring transparency and fairness to how PBMs hired by insurance companies reimburse pharmacies, ensuring that patients were not overcharged for their medications. We carefully considered the potential consequences of these laws to ensure they would not affect access to medications for TRICARE beneficiaries or other patients.

Even after the PBMs filed lawsuits, the state laws were upheld by the United States Supreme Court. These laws were the foundation of our efforts to ensure pharmacies get paid fairly, insurance companies are not overcharged, and consumers can access the medications they need.

Now, the state Legislature has rushed to pass Act 624 with little time for public comment or discussion of the potential harm it could cause.

It's true some veterans may be eligible to use the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system for service-connected illnesses and injuries. But the VA is overwhelmed with patients, and military pharmacies also operate under budget constraints. I was told by the VA to wait three months for a primary-care doctor appointment and to wait three months for a referral to a specialist, in hopes that the specialist will prescribe the medicine that works rather than try other alternatives.

This is not just a matter of policy for me; it is a matter of life and death. I have Crohn's disease, a chronic and debilitating condition that requires an expensive specialty injection called Stelara. Accredo ships refrigerated Stelara directly to my home every four weeks, and I pay a set $38 co-pay established by Congress. Without it, I can expect abdominal resection surgeries and the resulting infection and sepsis. When I was an employee of the state, their employee benefits managers refused to pay for it. When I asked our local active-duty base pharmacy if they could supply this medication, they referred me to Express Scripts and Accredo.

In 2024, Express Scripts Pharmacy sent over 700,000 common prescriptions, while Accredo shipped over 72,000 specialty prescriptions to patients in Arkansas. If this law goes into effect in January 2026, Arkansans military beneficiaries and many other patients would lose access to mail-delivered prescriptions that are a lifeline for many, including me.

The government of Arkansas has made it clear: They do not care about military people. The consequences for military families and thousands of Arkansans who may lose access to their medications will be devastating. If this goes forward or other states follow Arkansas' lead, expect catastrophic consequences for millions of military beneficiaries.

Our country made a promise to our men, women and families in uniform. I believe in fairness, transparency and oversight, but all this law does is seek to preserve an antiquated business model.

According to a DoD press release, health care costs for these three contracts are estimated to range between $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion over the next five years.
With the new contracts, Tricare is moving from the current 11 regions involving four companies that operate under seven contracts to three regions with three healthcare companies under three contracts.
Winkenwerder also announced that Navy Rear Adm. James A. Johnson has been appointed as the new Tricare West regional director.
Johnson, a 37-year veteran, will be responsible for the administration of health care contracts in the west region; providing support to military medical facility commanders there; sustaining quality care, and improving customer satisfaction.","The Defense Department got the ""best value"" for its money when new Tricare contracts were awarded in late August to three healthcare companies to manage care for more than 8 million military personnel and their family members, the Pentagon's leading health official said here Sept. 10.

During a meeting with reporters in his office, Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said, ""We've made a good program (Tricare) even better. The changes that we've implemented in this new set of contracts put customer satisfaction first.""

DoD health officials announced Aug. 21 that Humana Military Healthcare Services, Louisville, Ky.; Health Net Federal Services, Rancho Cordova, Calif.; and TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corp, Phoenix, Ariz., were awarded the contracts for its managed care system.

According to a DoD press release, health care costs for these three contracts are estimated to range between $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion over the next five years. The new contracts will be phased in over the next year, and will replace seven contracts currently in place, according to the release.

Winkenwerder told reporters that Tricare is restructuring its managed care system. With the new contracts, Tricare is moving from the current 11 regions involving four companies that operate under seven contracts to three regions with three healthcare companies under three contracts.

Humana received a $2 billion contract for the Tricare South region. That region covers healthcare for beneficiaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and the eastern portion of Texas.

TriWest received a $2.1 billion contract for the Tricare West region, which covers Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, west Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

Health Net was awarded a $2.2 billion contract for the Tricare North region that includes Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Sierra Military Health Services, Las Vegas, which had covered the Northeast, filed a formal protest Aug. 29 with the Government Accounting Office on its unsuccessful bid. A press release by the company stated that company representatives met with DoD health officials to discuss the evaluation process used to award the contract and the evaluation findings. ""Subsequently, the company determined there were serious and material errors in the evaluation process and findings, warranting a formal protest,"" the release said.

Winkenwerder told reporters, ""We were not surprised that there was a protest based on the size of these contracts and the importance to the bidders."" And he added that healthcare services for beneficiaries will not be interrupted and, ""will move forward.""

Winkenwerder said the contracts were carefully evaluated based on several factors, such as clinical quality, customer satisfaction, past performance and price. These factors, he said, helped determine which contracts offered the ""best value"" to the government and its beneficiaries. He said cost is ""least important in the 'best value' package.""

Winkenwerder also announced that Navy Rear Adm. James A. Johnson has been appointed as the new Tricare West regional director. Johnson, a 37-year veteran, will be responsible for the administration of health care contracts in the west region; providing support to military medical facility commanders there; sustaining quality care, and improving customer satisfaction.

TRICARE has accomplished a lot in the past year, such as establishing TRICARE For Life coverage for beneficiaries over age 65, Carrato noted.
Winkenwerder, who came on board Oct. 16, 2001, also praised the quality of healthcare TRICARE provides to its 8.3 million beneficiaries.
The quality and the energy of the military medical team are superb, he said, and could be even better.
Harnessing digitized, Web-based data collection and information services will help improve customer service and provide increased efficiencies for TRICARE, Winkenwerder said.","Senior DoD leaders Feb. 4 praised improvements made to TRICARE, the military's healthcare system, and also noted the need for new methods and efficiencies to meet anticipated challenges ahead.

Hundreds of military and civilian health care professionals heard remarks by David S.C. Chu, undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness; Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs; and Thomas F. Carrato, TRICARE Management Activity executive director, at the first day of the Feb. 4-7 TRICARE conference here.

The consensus of Chu, Winkenwerder and Carrato was that TRICARE was living up to its 2002 conference theme: ""Getting the Job Done for America.""

""Nobody does it better than you,"" Carrato said to the audience. He became TMA executive director on June 7, 2001.

TRICARE has accomplished a lot in the past year, such as establishing TRICARE For Life coverage for beneficiaries over age 65, Carrato noted. At the same time, TRICARE professionals have fixed long-time customer irritants by improving claims processing, establishing a toll-free information line, simplifying pharmacy program co-payments, and more, he said.

Carrato then read a letter from a 75-year-old widow who praised the TRICARE coverage for her breast cancer treatment:

""Thank you so much, thank you to the American taxpayers and to the people who worked so hard to get this assistance measure through Congress. … I cannot express how much I truly appreciate this help, but I hope this letter gives you some idea,"" the woman wrote.

The woman's letter, Carrato noted, ""represents the promise that we've kept, the trust that we've restored, and the vision we've achieved to deliver this kind of high-quality healthcare benefit (to) all of these deserving men and women, these truly great Americans.""

Winkenwerder, who came on board Oct. 16, 2001, also praised the quality of healthcare TRICARE provides to its 8.3 million beneficiaries. He noted some challenges for the coming year.

The attacks of Sept. 11 and the anthrax attacks that followed the hijackings ""have mobilized our country and the Department of Defense,"" he said. Military medics and healthcare workers, he noted, ""continue to be on the front lines"" in today's wartime environment. The quality and the energy of the military medical team are superb, he said, and could be even better. He then outlined his priorities:

o Improve force health protection and medical readiness.

o Improve performance of the TRICARE program.

o Strengthen relationships outside of DoD, such as with the Department of Veterans Affairs.

o Ensure the services recruit the best medical professionals in the world.

""Biological warfare is no longer a theoretical possibility,"" Winkenwerder said. Consequently, the nation's vaccine policies and programs need to be ""greatly bolstered and refocused,"" he noted.

The Food and Drug Administration recently certified the anthrax vaccine made by Bioport of Lansing, Mich., Winkenwerder remarked. Vaccine production will resume soon, he said.

""We will soon announce our policy within DoD on how we will prioritize the resumption of vaccine efforts,"" he said, adding, ""One thing is certain … the vaccine is safe and it is effective.""

DoD's medical readiness training programs for biological, chemical and radiological warfare ""demand significant attention,"" Winkenwerder said. ""My goal is that all military health personnel will be trained to recognize and manage chemical and biological agents, depending upon their level and their position.""

Winkenwerder added that military medical personnel will also be trained to deal with the consequences of biological or chemical attack on both individuals and entire populations.

Though TRICARE has come a long way, ""We've got an opportunity to get (the job done) even better,"" he noted. He pledged faster identification and solution of problems within the system; better, integrated communications with beneficiaries; and solutions ""that put the responsibility on us, not on the beneficiaries, our customers.""

Harnessing digitized, Web-based data collection and information services will help improve customer service and provide increased efficiencies for TRICARE, Winkenwerder said.

Addressing efficiency and cost-effectiveness, Chu noted that DoD medical professionals in the future could expect to work with the Department of Veteran Affairs in a DoD outreach effort of working with other federal agencies. For instance, he said, key areas of DoD-VA coordination would include joint procurement of pharmaceuticals and other materials and joint facility use.

Early intervention, trauma-informed care, and veteran-specific treatment programs are essential for effective support and long-term recovery.
