The Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Today I would like to share two major bits of progress first: I will start with the fact that I am proud to announce that the FX Super One First Pre-Production Vehicles Roll-off Ceremony is scheduled for December 21 at our manufacturing facility in Hanford, CA! We have reached a critical state of readiness: the full set of components for the first several pre-production vehicles have arrived on site. With nearly 3,000 parts per vehicle now in hand, we will formally launch production tomorrow.

This milestone carries significance in six areas:

1. It marks the near completion of the Bridge Closure for our Bridge strategy, covering a closed loop of supply chain, testing, logistics, customs clearance and production. This further validates the feasibility and strategic value of the Bridge model, across tariff adaptation, ICTS compliance, cost management, operational efficiency, and so on.

2. It marks that the Hanford factory has entered the FX pre-production phase. Our production, industrialization, supply chain, and Bridge systems are now forming a closed-loop synergy.

3. It could provide a replicable, fast-track mass production framework for the scalable deployment of future FX models.

4. It represents a new breakthrough in the Company’s business and supports improvements in our capital position and capital market expectations.

5. It could empower the global expansion of China's automotive supply chain and unlock its value within the U.S.— the world's highest-value market.

6. It could fill a structural gap, tap the blue-ocean segment in the U.S., and generate incremental value in the U.S. market, including job creation and contributions to manufacturing reshoring.

The second bit of progress is that the Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners. This could help us build a solid foundation for our strategic advancement and stockholder value maximization.

On EAI flywheel—other FFAI updates this week:

S5 Capital Markets and Finance — FF attended UBS’s Global Industrials and Transportation Conference in Florida — a major platform for global capital, industrial and mobility sectors. During the event, we held in-depth discussions with multiple institutional investors, providing a systematic overview of our strategy and core business progress.

Turning to S6 Middle East — Following the delivery of the very first Super One to global icon Andrés Iniesta — coinciding with the UAE’s 54th National Day — our Middle East team brought FF 91 and FX Super One across all seven Emirates, where the “Twin Stars” shined across the region. Next, the Middle East team will speed up assembly ramp up and keep pushing for the assembly and delivery of the FX Super One AIHER variant and the potential battery electric variant, so that more users can be among the first to experience the unique value of First Class EAI-MPV and have the region truly enter the era of AI-powered luxury mobility.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions — Since the FX Super one Initial Product Launch on July 17, we know that our stockholders, investors, and users have been eagerly waiting updates on our milestones and our business vision for the next few years. Our goal has always been to share a roadmap that is clear and executable. Due to complex review cycles and approval procedures, we have not been able to share these details as quickly as intended. This experience has underscored the need for us to improve our internal synergy and operational efficiency.

With our Five-Year Plan closing in on approval, the path could soon be clear for us to share our key milestone goals and forward-looking business plans. We will begin releasing these updates soon and look forward to your continued attention. That’s it for today. I’ll see you at the Hanford factory on December 21.”

HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“ HUTCHMED ”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that following the contract renewal with the China National Healthcare Security Administration (“NHSA”), the updated National Reimbursement Drug List (“NRDL”) effective on January 1, 2026 will continue to include ELUNATE ® , ORPATHYS ® and SULANDA ® . In addition, TAZVERIK ® will be included in the first edition of the National Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List (“Commercial Insurance Drug List”).

ELUNATE ® (fruquintinib) is included for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial cancer with Mismatch Repair proficient (pMMR) tumors that have failed prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, in combination with TYVYT ® (sintilimab injection). It is also renewed for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and those who have previously received or are not suitable for receiving anti-VEGF therapy or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (RAS wild-type).

ORPATHYS ® (savolitinib) is included for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 skipping alteration.

SULANDA ® (surufatinib) is renewed for the treatment of patients with unresectable; locally advanced or metastatic; progressive non-functional, well-differentiated (G1 or G2) pancreatic and non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

TAZVERIK ® (tazemetostat) is included in the Commercial Insurance Drug List for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma with EZH2 mutation who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. In July 2025, the NHSA issued the 2025 Adjustment Work Plan for the NRDL and the Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List, announcing the establishment of the new Commercial Insurance Drug List. This list, together with the NRDL, forms a key component of China’s multi-level medical insurance system. This new list focuses on medicines with high innovation and significant clinical value that fall beyond the scope of basic medical insurance, including certain high-cost oncology drugs, gene therapies, and rare disease therapies, enabling reimbursement through commercial health insurance products such as high-limit medical insurance, inclusive health plans (“Huiminbao”) and group health insurance. This multi-layered reimbursement framework enhances patient access to breakthrough treatments while supporting the sustainable development of China’s innovative pharmaceutical sector.

About NRDL

The government in China has placed great importance on improving the affordability of drug treatments for the public. As of end of 2024, 1.33 billion people in China had basic medical insurance coverage, representing around 95% of the entire population. The NRDL is updated every year, and inclusion on the list is subject to renewal every two years. The NHSA annually convenes a broad network of experts in medicine, pharmacology, pharmacoeconomics and actuarial valuation to identify innovative medicines to consider for NRDL inclusion. Reimbursement of Category B medicines, including novel oncology medicines, requires varying degrees of copayment from patients, depending on their provinces or types of NHSA insurance scheme enrollment.

– NXC-201 demonstrated a complete response (CR) rate of 75% (15/20) (at s/u IFE(-) level) by independent review committee –

– In four out of five pending patients, MRD negativity in bone marrow predicts future complete response, potentially increasing future CR rate to 95% –

– NEXICART-2 final readout and BLA submission planned in 2026 –

LOS ANGELES, CA, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immix Biopharma, Inc. (“ImmixBio”, “Company”, “We” or “Us” or ”IMMX”), a global leader in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis, today announced positive phase 2 NXC-201 results in an oral presentation at ASH 2025 presented by Heather Landau, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. NXC-201 demonstrated a complete response (CR) rate of 75% (15/20) (at s/u IFE(-) level) by independent review committee. In four out of five pending patients, MRD negativity in bone marrow predicts future complete response, potentially increasing future CR rate to 95%. NEXICART-2 final readout and BLA submission are planned for 2026.

“In the larger patient set Phase 2 results presented today at ASH, we are thrilled to see complete response rates continue to improve in NEXICART-2. These excellent results demonstrate the potential of NXC-201 to address the significant unmet medical need in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis,” said Ilya Rachman, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Immix Biopharma. Gabriel Morris, Chief Financial Officer of Immix Biopharma, added, “This exciting Phase 2 milestone brings us one step closer to delivering this promising therapy to patients upon planned BLA submission in 2026.”

ASH Presentation Results – Phase 2

Prior to NXC-201 treatment, all patients were exposed to an anti-CD38 antibody and a proteasome inhibitor. Median prior lines of therapy was 4 (range: 1-10). All patients had baseline relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis organ involvement. After NXC-201 treatment, complete responses (CRs) were observed in 75% (15 out of 20 patients) (at s/u IFE(-) level) by independent review committee. In four out of five pending patients, minimum residual disease (MRD) negativity in bone marrow predicts future complete response, potentially increasing the future CR rate to 95%. Downstream clinical improvement, including organ responses, were observed in 70% of evaluable patients (7/10). No neurotoxicity was observed. Only low-grade cytokine release syndrome has been observed with a median duration of 1 day. The ASH presentation contains clinical data as of November 13, 2025.

Current treatments typically result in a 10% or lower complete response (CR) rate in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis according to Zanwar, et al 2024, indicating a high unmet medical need.

SLS009 in combination with AZA/VEN achieved a 46% overall response rate across all cohorts, a 58% overall response rate in patients with one prior line of therapy, and encouraging survival outcomes in heavily-pretreated AML-MR following prior VEN-based treatment

Median overall survival (mOS) of 8.9 months in the least pretreated patient cohort; across all cohorts, mOS was not yet reached in patients with one prior line of therapy vs historical benchmark of approximately 2.5 months

SLS009 30 mg IV twice weekly added to AZA/VEN was safe and feasible, with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed

Study expansion to evaluate SLS009 plus AZA/VEN in newly diagnosed AML with high-risk features is planned for Q1 2026

NEW YORK, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SLS) (“SELLAS’’ or the “Company”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today announced that clinical data from its ongoing Phase 2 study of SLS009, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, in combination with azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax (VEN) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplastic syndrome-related changes (AML-MR) after prior VEN-based treatment were presented today at the 67 th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, being held December 6 – 9, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.

In this Phase 2 expansion study, R/R AML-MR patients (N = 35 evaluable) were studied in three separate cohorts (cohorts 3-5) who were previously treated with VEN-based regimens and either relapsed and/or were refractory to VEN and were then treated with SLS009 plus AZA/VEN. The median age of participating patients was 69 years, and 98% of patients had ELN adverse-risk AML, with the most frequent mutations being ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53, and SRSF2.

SLS009 in combination with AZA/VEN demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in patients with R/R AML-MR, and among the 35 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (CR+CRi+MLFS) was 46%, including 29% achieving CR/CRi. Patients harboring ASXL1 or TP53 mutations achieved response rates of 48% (19% CR/CRi) and 57% (29% CR/CRi), respectively. The median overall survival (mOS) was exceedingly higher than the expected 2.6 months in this R/R AML patient population, and in the least pretreated cohort, mOS reached 8.9 months. Across all cohorts, patients with one prior line of therapy experienced the greatest benefit, with a 58% response rate and mOS not yet reached. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or treatment-related deaths were observed, and the combination was well tolerated.

“These results further reinforce the therapeutic potential of SLS009 to overcome resistance to venetoclax-based regimens by suppressing the expression of MCL-1, a key mechanism of resistance to BCL-2 inhibition in AML,” said Dr. Dragan Cicic, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer of SELLAS. “The combination of SLS009 with azacitidine and venetoclax demonstrates encouraging activity in a heavily pretreated population with adverse-risk AML-MR, including those harboring ASXL1 and TP53 mutations. We are particularly encouraged by the strong responses in patients with limited prior therapy and look forward to expanding this combination regimen into newly diagnosed AML with high-risk features.”

All three dose groups (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) showed impressive monotherapy efficacy, with VGPR+ (very good partial response or better) of ≥70% despite limited follow-up; evidence shows that these responses are expected to deepen over time

Across all dose groups, 95% (19 of 20 patients) of all evaluable VGPR+ patients achieved minimal residual disease negative status

Data featured in an ASH oral presentation; LINKER-MM4 is the first clinical trial to evaluate a BCMAxCD3 bispecific monotherapy in NDMM and is part of a broad clinical development program evaluating Lynozyfic-based regimens in earlier lines of treatment

Regeneron to host virtual ‘Regeneron Roundtable’ investor event to discuss its multiple myeloma development program on Wednesday, December 10 at 8:30 a.m. ET

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced encouraging data from the Phase 1/2 LINKER-MM4 trial evaluating Lynozyfic™ (linvoseltamab) in adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who were transplant eligible or ineligible were shared in an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. These data build on results from a broad clinical development program evaluating Lynozyfic in early lines of treatment, including precursor conditions, as monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care or novel agents.

“The treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma often relies on complicated combinations of quadruplet or triplet regimens, each with its own toxicities, in order to achieve rapid and durable responses, which can be incredibly burdensome for these patients,” said Robert Orlowski, M.D., Ph.D., Deputy Chair, Professor of Medicine, and Director of Translational Myeloma Research in the Departments of Lymphoma/Myeloma and Experimental Therapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the lead investigator for the LINKER-MM4 trial. “As the first to evaluate a BCMAxCD3 bispecific monotherapy in this setting, LINKER-MM4 seeks to understand whether frontline intervention with a single agent can deliver strong efficacy, enabling the simplification and potentially greater tolerability of these regimens. Lynozyfic monotherapy is already achieving MRD negativity rates comparable to quadruplet regimens but earlier in the treatment course, and these compelling results are expected to deepen with longer follow up. These results underscore Lynozyfic’s potential as a foundational component of frontline treatment regimens for multiple myeloma – or even a monotherapy regimen – for both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients.”

LINKER-MM4 is an ongoing, open-label Phase 1/2 trial investigating Lynozyfic in adults with NDMM. During a Phase 1A (dose escalation) cohort, patients were treated with a step-up dosing regimen followed by 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg doses of Lynozyfic. The lowest (50 mg) and highest (200 mg) tolerated doses were selected for further evaluation in the Phase 1B (dose-expansion) cohort. Among the 45 treated patients in both Phase 1A and 1B, 28 were transplant eligible, and 17 were transplant ineligible.

Across all dose levels (n=45), there was a 1.2 months median time to onset of response (range: 1-4.5 months). All three dose groups (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) showed impressive efficacy, with a VGPR+ (very good partial response or better) of ≥70% with limited follow-up. Evidence shows that these responses are expected to deepen over time. Across all dose groups, 95% (19 of 20 patients) of all minimum residual disease (MRD) evaluable VGPR+ patients achieved MRD negative status at 10 -5 sensitivity.

Across all dose levels, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; all Grade 1: 44%) and neutropenia (any Grade: 38%; Grade 3/4: 33%). Among other adverse events of special interest, one patient in the 50 mg cohort experienced Grade 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Infections occurred in 84% of patients (Grade 1/2: 51%; Grade 3: 33%) with the majority occurring within the first three months of treatment and the rate of infections decreased over time. There were no ≥Grade 4 infections, Grade 5 TEAEs or dose-limiting toxicities. Ten patients elected to undergo an autologous stem cell transplant, all of whom had an acceptable CD34+ stem cell yield post-induction (range: 2.5-11.5 x 10 6 /kg).

A broad clinical development program investigating Lynozyfic in early stages of the disease is underway. This includes the Phase 2 portion of the LINKER-MM4 trial evaluating Lynozyfic at the recommended 200 mg dose, as well as LINKER-MM6 (EMN39), a trial evaluating a combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) followed by Lynozyfic monotherapy compared with continued DRd in transplant-ineligible NDMM.

The use of Lynozyfic described above is investigational, and its safety and efficacy has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority for this indication.

About Multiple Myeloma

As the second most common blood cancer, there are over 187,000 new cases of MM diagnosed globally every year, with more than 36,000 diagnosed and 12,000 deaths anticipated in the U.S. in 2025. The disease is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (MM cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. Despite treatment advances, MM is not curable, and while current treatments are able to slow progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience cancer progression and require additional therapies.

About Lynozyfic

Lynozyfic was invented using Regeneron’s VelocImmune ® technology and is a fully human BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on MM cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing. Lynozyfic is approved to treat certain adults with R/R MM: in the U.S. after four lines of therapy and in the European Union after at least three prior therapies.

In the U.S., the generic name for Lynozyfic in its approved indications is linvoseltamab-gcpt, with gcpt as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. FDA. Outside of the U.S., the generic name of Lynozyfic in its approved indications is linvoseltamab.

Lynozyfic is being investigated in a broad clinical development program exploring its use as a monotherapy as well as in combination regimens across different lines of therapy in MM, including earlier lines of treatment, as well as plasma cell precursor disorders. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

In addition to LINKER-MM4 , ongoing trials include:

LINKER-MM1: Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities and anti-tumor activity of Lynozyfic monotherapy in R/R MM

LINKER-MM2 : Phase 1b, open-label trial evaluating Lynozyfic in combination with other cancer treatments in patients with R/R MM

LINKER-MM3 : Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy compared to the combination of elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in R/R MM

LINKER-MM5: Phase 3 trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy or in combination with carfilzomib compared to standard of care combination regimens in patients with R/R MM

LINKER-MM6 (EMN39): Phase 3 trial, in collaboration with the European Myeloma Network, evaluating daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone induction followed by Lynozyfic monotherapy compared to continued daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in NDMM who are transplant-ineligible

Phase 1 trial evaluating Lynozyfic in combination with a Regeneron CD38xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in R/R MM

LINKER-SMM1 : Phase 2 trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy in high-risk smoldering MM

LINKER-MGUS1 : Phase 2 dose-ranging trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy in high-risk monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance and non-high-risk SMM

LINKER-AL2 : Phase 1/2 trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy in R/R systemic light chain amyloidosis

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS

What is the most important information I should know about LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and infusion-related reactions (IRR), or neurologic problems.

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and infusion related reactions (IRR) . CRS is common during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and can also be serious or life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of CRS or IRR, including:

fever of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher

fast heartbeat

chills or shaking

dizziness or light-headedness

trouble breathing

Neurologic problems. LYNOZYFIC can cause neurologic problems that can be serious or life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of neurologic problems, including:

headache

agitation, trouble staying awake, confusion or disorientation, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations)

trouble speaking, writing, thinking, remembering things, paying attention, or understanding things

problems walking, muscle weakness, shaking (tremors), loss of balance, or muscle spasms

numbness and tingling (feeling like “pins and needles”)

burning, throbbing, or stabbing pain

changes in your handwriting

seizures

Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic problems, you will receive LYNOZYFIC on a “step-up dosing schedule” and should be hospitalized for 24 hours after the first and second “step-up” doses.

During the “step-up dosing schedule”:

For your first dose, you will receive a smaller “step-up” dose of LYNOZYFIC on Day 1 of your treatment.

For your second dose, you will receive a larger “step-up” dose of LYNOZYFIC, which is usually given on Day 8 of your treatment.

For your third dose, you will receive the first treatment dose of LYNOZYFIC, which is usually given on Day 15 of your treatment.

Your healthcare provider may repeat one or both of the “step-up” doses depending on side effects or if your treatment is delayed.

Before the “step-up” doses and the first two treatment doses of LYNOZYFIC, you will receive medicines to help reduce your risk of CRS and IRR. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need to receive medicine to help reduce your risk of side effects with future doses.

LYNOZYFIC is available only through the LYNOZYFIC Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) due to the risk of side effects of CRS and neurologic problems. You will receive a Patient Wallet Card from your healthcare provider. Carry the LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card with you at all times and show it to all of your healthcare providers. The LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card lists signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems. Get medical help right away if you develop any of the signs and symptoms listed on the LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card . You may need to be treated in a hospital.

Your healthcare provider will monitor you for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems during treatment with LYNOZYFIC, as well as other side effects, and may treat you in a hospital if needed. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop or completely stop your treatment with LYNOZYFIC if you develop CRS, neurologic problems, or any other severe side effects.

If you have any questions about LYNOZYFIC, ask your healthcare provider.

Before receiving LYNOZYFIC, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have an infection.

are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. LYNOZYFIC may harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Females who are able to become pregnant:

Your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

You should use an effective form of birth control (contraception) during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and for 3 months after your last dose of LYNOZYFIC.

are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known whether LYNOZYFIC passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and for 3 months after your last dose of LYNOZYFIC.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

How will I receive LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC will be given to you by your healthcare provider by infusion through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous infusion).

After the “step-up dosing schedule”, the treatment dose of LYNOZYFIC is usually given 1 time each week for 11 doses, and then 1 time every other week for 5 doses. After these doses and based on how your disease responds, your healthcare provider will decide if you are able to receive LYNOZYFIC less often (every 4 weeks) or will continue to have every other week treatment.

Your healthcare provider will decide how long you will receive treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

If you miss any appointments, call your healthcare provider as soon as possible to reschedule your appointment. It is important for you to be monitored closely for side effects during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

What should I avoid while receiving LYNOZYFIC?

Do not drive, or operate heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, or do other dangerous activities for 48 hours after completing each of your “step-up” doses or at any time during treatment with LYNOZYFIC if you develop new neurologic symptoms, until the symptoms go away.

What are the possible side effects of LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC may cause serious side effects, including:

Infections. LYNOZYFIC can cause bacterial, viral, or fungal infections that are serious, life-threatening, or that may lead to death. Upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia are common during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Your healthcare provider will monitor you for signs and symptoms of infection before and during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicines for you to help prevent infections and treat you as needed if you develop an infection during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of infection during treatment with LYNOZYFIC, including:

fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher

chills

cough

shortness of breath

chest pain

sore throat

pain during urination

feeling weak or generally unwell

Decreased white blood cell counts . Decreased white blood cell counts are common during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and can also be severe. Fever can happen with low white blood cell counts and may be a sign that you have an infection. Your healthcare provider will check your blood cell counts before you start treatment and during treatment with LYNOZYFIC, and will treat you as needed.

Liver problems. LYNOZYFIC can cause increased liver enzymes and bilirubin in your blood. These increases can happen with or without you also having CRS. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your liver before starting and during treatment with LYNOZYFIC. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any of the following signs or symptoms of liver problems:

tiredness

loss of appetite

pain in your right upper stomach-area (abdomen)

dark urine yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes

The most common side effects of LYNOZYFIC include:

muscle and bone pain

nausea

cough

headache

diarrhea

tiredness or weakness

shortness of breath

The most common severe abnormal blood test results with LYNOZYFIC include: low white blood cell counts and low red blood cell counts.

These are not all of the possible side effects of LYNOZYFIC.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

Please see full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNING, and Medication Guide for LYNOZYFIC.

What is LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with multiple myeloma who:

have already received at least 4 treatment regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody to treat their multiple myeloma, and

their cancer has come back or did not respond to prior treatment.

It is not known if LYNOZYFIC is safe and effective in children.

93% overall response and 76% complete response rates with median progression-free survival of 18 months in patients with large B-cell lymphoma in the 3L+ setting

83% overall response and 61% complete response rates in cohort comprised predominantly of patients with primary refractory large B-cell lymphoma in the 2L setting

Manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration; no high-grade CRS and ≤ 5% of patients with Grade ≥ 3 ICANS following dexamethasone prophylaxis

Lyell management will host an investor webcast with presenting author and ronde-cel investigator Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, at 8:30 AM ET on Monday, December 8 th

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lyell Immunopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: LYEL), a clinical-stage company advancing a pipeline of next-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies for patients with cancer, today announced new clinical and translational data from the ongoing clinical trial of rondecabtagene autoleucel (ronde-cel, also known as LYL314) in patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), which were presented today in two oral presentations at the 67 th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. As of the data cutoff date of September 5, 2025, ronde-cel continued to demonstrate robust clinical responses with a manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration. A 93% overall response rate, a 76% complete response rate, and median progression-free survival of 18 months were reported for patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) LBCL in the third- or later-line (3L+) setting. Patients evaluated in the second-line (2L) setting (94% with difficult-to-treat primary refractory disease) achieved an 83% overall response rate and a 61% complete response rate, and 70% of patients with a complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer.

Ronde-cel is an autologous dual-targeting CD19/CD20 CAR T-cell product candidate in pivotal development for patients with R/R LBCL. Ronde-cel CAR T cells are designed to have enhanced antitumor activity through a proprietary manufacturing process that enriches for CD62L-positive cells to produce a CAR T-cell product with a higher proportion of naïve and central memory T cells. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted ronde-cel Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL in the 3L+ and 2L settings.

“These data from the ongoing clinical trial showing high rates of durable complete responses along with a manageable safety profile in patients with high-risk large B-cell lymphoma represent the potential of ronde-cel to improve patient outcomes,” commented Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “The two pivotal trials underway, including the first-of-its kind head-to-head CAR T-cell trial, are expected to provide a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the potential for ronde-cel to demonstrate differentiated benefit over approved CD19 CAR T-cell therapies.”

Sixty-nine CAR T-cell naïve patients with R/R LBCL received ronde-cel as of the data cutoff date for the presentation. The efficacy evaluable population, defined as those patients with Day 84 assessments or prior disease progression or death, consisted of 47 patients (29 in the 3L+ and 18 in the 2L settings). Imaging assessments were performed locally by the sites. Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with a high-risk, heavily pre-treated patient population, particularly as compared to historical trials of CD19 CAR T-cell products: median ages of 64 and 65 years with 20% (9/45) and 21% (5/24) of patients being 75 years or older in the 3L+ and 2L settings, respectively; and primary refractory disease in 49% (22/45) and 92% (22/24) of patients in the 3L+ and 2L settings, respectively.

Patients Evaluated in the 3L+ Setting

There were 29 efficacy-evaluable 3L+ patients with R/R LBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, or transformed follicular lymphoma) with a median follow up time of 12 months as of the data cutoff date. In these patients:

The overall response rate was 93% (27/29 patients), with 76% (22/29) of patients achieving a complete response

72% (13/18) of patients with complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer

Median progression-free survival was 18 months

Patients Evaluated in the 2L Setting

There were 18 efficacy-evaluable patients enrolled in the 2L setting with a median follow-up time of 9 months as of the data cutoff date. Of these efficacy-evaluable patients, 94% had primary refractory disease. In these patients:

The overall response rate was 83% (15/18 patients), with 61% (11/18) achieving a complete response

70% (7/10) of patients with complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer

The median duration of complete response was not reached

Safety Data

In 69 patients, including patients from both the 3L+ and the 2L cohorts, a manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration was observed. No Grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in any patient. Twenty-five of the 69 patients received protocol-directed dexamethasone prophylaxis (10 mg/day for 3 days). One case (4%) of Grade 3 or greater ICANS was reported in a patient with high disease burden; no case of Grade 2 ICANS was reported.

In all 69 patients, as of the data cutoff date, low rates of Grade 1 (32%) or Grade 2 (29%) CRS were reported; ICANS rates were reported as follows: Grade 1 (9%), Grade 2 (3%), and Grade 3 or greater (12%) of patients. The median time to complete resolution of all reports of ICANS was 4 days. Cell pharmacodynamic data demonstrated robust CAR T-cell expansion and persistence that were similar in patients with or without dexamethasone prophylaxis. No deaths were determined to be related to ronde-cel administration.

Pivotal Clinical Trials

Lyell has initiated two pivotal clinical trials of ronde-cel: PiNACLE – H2H and PiNACLE.

PiNACLE – H2H is a Phase 3 head-to-head CAR T-cell therapy randomized controlled clinical trial of ronde-cel versus investigator’s choice of either lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) or axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in patients with R/R LBCL receiving treatment in the 2L setting. Patients randomized to ronde-cel will be treated with a dose of 100 x 10 6 CAR T cells; patients in the control arm will be treated as per the product label. The primary endpoint of the trial is event-free survival and the trial is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients per arm (N = 400) with R/R LBCL, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, or transformed follicular or transformed mantle cell lymphoma who have not previously received CAR T-cell therapy. Patients may be treated with ronde-cel in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. More information about the PiNACLE – H2H trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT07188558) here .

PiNACLE is a single-arm trial of ronde-cel that is enrolling up to 120 patients receiving treatment in the 3L+ setting. This registration trial is a seamless expansion of the 3L+ cohort from the Phase 1/2 trial. The dose is 100 x 10 6 CAR+ cells and the primary endpoint is overall response rate. Patients may be treated with ronde-cel in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. More information about the PiNACLE trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05826535) here .

Ronde-cel Translational Data

Translational data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial showed that ronde-cel manufactured with CD62L enrichment achieved robust expansion and high expression of memory-related genes after infusion in patients with LBCL. An evaluation of ronde-cel and published data for CD19 CAR T-cell products demonstrated that ronde-cel had a higher proportion of CD62L-positive T cells with a higher proportion of memory-cell phenotype prior to infusion (ronde-cel, N = 34; axi-cel, N = 110 and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel), N = 31). In addition, ronde-cel had up to a three-fold higher expansion in patients after infusion compared to the expansion of approved CD19 CAR T-cell products. The product memory-cell phenotype was positively correlated with expansion. Peripheral blood samples collected from patients one month after infusion (N = 9) also had a higher proportion of CAR T cells with a memory phenotype compared to cells from axi-cel-treated patients (N = 4). Ronde-cel CAR-positive T cells collected from patients one (N = 7) and two months (N = 3) after infusion demonstrated sustained capacity to proliferate, kill tumor cells over 72 hours, and secrete cytokines (N = 3).

The clinical data were highlighted in an oral presentation by Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA. Translational data were presented in a separate oral presentation by Akil Merchant, MD, Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Lymphoma Program at the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.

Conference Call Details

Lyell’s management will host an investor conference call and webcast to review these data at 8:30 AM ET on Monday, December 8th. The webcast registration link can be accessed here . A replay of the event and presentation materials will be available on the Investor page of the Lyell Website following the end of the event.

Poster outlines clinical benefit with acceptable safety profile across 9 tested dosing regimens

Accelerated step-up dosing and higher dosing frequency is feasible and results in increased exposure

Six of eight responders presented with low bone marrow blast counts at baseline, supporting further investigation in this patient population most likely to benefit from MP0533

ZURICH-SCHLIEREN, Switzerland and CONCORD, Mass., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR Molecular Partners AG (SIX: MOLN; NASDAQ: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotech company developing a new class of custom-built protein drugs known as DARPin therapeutics (“Molecular Partners” or the “Company”), has today announced it will present updated data from a Phase 1/2a trial of the multispecific T-cell engager MP0533 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a poster at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, taking place December 6-9, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.

The poster outlines the latest results of this multicenter, open-label study evaluating MP0533 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05673057 ). Data from cohorts 8 and 9 show that densified MP0533 dosing appears tolerable and leads to markedly improved serum exposure in treatment cycle 1, with encouraging preliminary antitumor activity.

“The results in patients with higher frequency dosing regimens of MP0533 are very encouraging. I am happy to see the clinical benefit of MP0533 in a mutation-agnostic manner in R/R AML patients, in particular those with lower disease burden. The data indicate that MP0533 has the potential to significantly improve treatment options for patients with AML and I support investigating MP0533 in a Phase 2 setting to confirm its safety and activity in earlier lines as consolidation addition to existing backbones,” said Prof. Courtney DiNardo, M.D., Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas, and co-chair of the MP0533 dose escalation review committee (DERC).

As of the data cut-off of September 1, 2025, 54 patients had been treated with MP0533. Eight of 48 evaluable patients achieved a response, with five reaching composite complete responses (3 complete responses, CR, and 2 CR with partial hemotologic recovery) and three reaching morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Six of the 8 responders, and 11 of 14 patients who achieved a reduction in bone marrow blasts of more than 50%, presented with less than 20% bone marrow blast at baseline, indicating that patients with low disease burden are most likely to benefit from MP0533. One patient in cohort 8 has been in complete remission for over a year, and one patient in cohort 9 is on the trial since 4 months. Cohort 10, which aims at reaching the same target dose as cohort 8 while exposing patients to more drug over time, is ongoing with data expected in 2026.

“The Phase 1/2a trial with MP0533 is making good progress, with the densified dosing regimen showing to be feasible, with an acceptable safety profile, and resulting in clinical benefit. The results warrant further exploration of MP0533’s potential, both in the R/R and front-line AML settings in combination with standard of care, and several consortia have approached us expressing interest in conducting such studies. We are actively engaging with potential partners and continue our dialogue with key opinion leaders and regulators to shape the next phase of development of our innovative T-cell engager for patients,” said Philippe Legenne, M.D., CMO of Molecular Partners .

MP0533 is a novel tetra-specific T cell-engaging DARPin designed for selective and broad killing of AML cells in a mutation-agnostic manner. MP0533 simultaneously targets three tumor-associated antigens CD33, CD123, and CD70 on AML cells as well as the immune activator CD3 on T cells. AML cells commonly co-express at least two of the three target antigens, whereas most healthy cells only express one or none. MP0533 binds with increasing avidity as the number of its target antigens present increases, thereby preferentially binding to AML cells over healthy cells. This unique mode of action is designed to enable T cell-mediated killing of AML cells while preserving a therapeutic window that minimizes damage to healthy cells.

About DARPin Therapeutics

DARPin (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein) therapeutics are a new class of custom-built protein drugs based on natural binding proteins that open new dimensions of multi-functionality and multi-target specificity in drug design. The flexible architecture, intrinsic potential for high affinity and specificity, small size and high stability of DARPins offer benefits to drug design over other currently available protein-based therapeutics. DARPin candidates can be radically simple, with a single DARPin unit acting as the delivery vector to a specific target; or multispecific, with the possibility of engaging more than five targets, and combining multiple and conditional functionalities in a unique DARPin drug candidate. The DARPin platform is designed to be a rapid and cost-effective drug discovery engine, producing drug candidates with optimized properties and high production yields. DARPin therapeutics have been clinically validated across several therapeutic areas and developed through to the registrational stage.

Tricare is a common health insurance in Indiana, and individuals who have Tricare may wish to find child therapists who are in-network with their health insurance.

When you see a child therapist who is in-network with Tricare, each session you’ll pay only a copay, which typically ranges from $0-$75/session. Depending on your plan, you may first need to pay the provider’s full session fee until you meet your annual deductible, which is the total amount of medical expenses required before your health insurance starts to cover costs. Some plans cover the cost of in-network therapy sessions before the deductible is met; to verify whether your specific plan covers therapy sessions and at what rate, visit the Tricare website or call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask about your coverage for outpatient mental health.

There are certain times you may need to file your own claims with WPS Government Services, the TFL contractor. Here’s what you need to know about when to file claims when you have Medicare and TFL.

“Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your military ID card at any medical appointment for a smooth claims process,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Who files my claims?

In most cases, your provider files your health care claims with Medicare first. Medicare pays its share and sends the claim to WPS for processing and payment of TRICARE’s portion of the claim.

Sometimes, you’ll need to file your own claim with WPS. This happens when:

TRICARE is your primary insurance.

Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

You have other health insurance.

What you need for filing claims

When you file a claim, include:

Patient’s Request for Medical Payment (DD Form 2642)

Medicare Summary Notice

Your OHI explanation of benefits (if you have OHI)

Provider’s bill with all required information

Required information on bills

Make sure your provider’s bill shows:

Your name

Provider’s name and address

Date and place of service

Description of services

Charges for each service

Diagnosis

Filing deadlines

You have one year from the date of service to file claims in the U.S, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook. Send claims to the WPS mailing address.

Filing claims overseas

When you get care overseas, TRICARE pays first (unless you have OHI). Medicare doesn’t pay for overseas care.

You must submit proof of payment with all overseas claims. This can be:

Credit card receipts

Canceled checks

Credit card statements

Provider invoices showing payment

File overseas claims where you received care. You have three years from the date of service to file these claims.

How do I get help?

Don’t forget—the deadlines for Airmen and Guardians to sign up for 2026 health, dental, and vision benefits are quickly approaching.

Tricare open season ends Dec. 9 for health care coverage starting Jan. 1. Open season for Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program ends Dec. 8.

Tricare offers two main health plan options: Tricare Prime and Tricare Select, according to Tricare’s Open Season page.

Tricare Prime: For individuals and families that prefer a primary care manager, or PCM, to oversee their care and want predictable costs. No deductible; just co-payment for most services. No copayments for active-duty family members. Referrals are required for most specialty care.

Tricare Select: Offers more flexibility for Airmen and Guardians. There’s no PCM and participants can see any Tricare-authorized provider they choose. No referrals are necessary for primary care and most specialty care. There is an annual deductible as well as co-payments or cost shares.

Airmen and Guardians living in the Atlanta, Ga., or Tampa, Fla., metropolitan area may want to consider signing up for the Tricare Prime Demo, an option designed to offer more options for eligible participants than the standard Tricare Prime plan, the Defense Health Agency announced in May. Interested participants have until Dec. 9 to sign up through Tricare Open Season. Coverage starts Jan. 1.

The Tricare Prime Demo plan, managed by CareSource Military & Veterans, doesn’t require participants get referrals to see network providers and offers virtual health services and a 24/7 nurse advice line, according to the May announcement. Go to the TRICARE Prime Demo to check eligibility and view details.

For dental and vision, the eligibility for the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP, has expanded to include “certain retired uniformed service members, active-duty family members, and survivors,” according to benefeds.gov. The site allows enrollees to check their eligibility, compare premiums and benefits, and estimate in-network and out-of-network service costs.

Airmen and Guardians may also consider opening a health care or dependent care flexible spending account, or FSA, during Tricare Open Season depending on their family’s needs. The Internal Revenue Service allows participants to contribute up to $3,400 pre-tax income into a healthcare FSA each year to cover expenses such as co-payments, vision and dental exams, eyeglasses, and braces, according to fsafeds.gov. But participants can only carry over up to $680 from one plan year to the next.

A dependent care FSA allows participants to use pre-tax income to pay for eligible dependent care services such as preschool, summer day camp, before or after-school programs, and child or adult day care. The IRS allows participants who are single, head of household, or married couples filing joint tax returns to contribute up to $7,500 per year, according to fsafeds.gov. Participants who are married, filing separate tax returns can contribute up to $3,750 per year.

The Air Force Aid Society announced plans in June to streamline the application process for financial aid to offer more assistance to Airmen and Guardians manage the costs of health care, child care and other expensive necessities.

Through the Department of Defense, Tricare offers health plans to uniformed service members, retirees and their families. CareSource Military and Veterans President Holly Joers explained to Becker’s how the insurer is getting in on the action.

So far, the plan has taken one big step to ease administrative burden and boost care access: Eliminating referrals for in-network care.

In Tricare Prime, members often have to work with their primary care manager — their main provider — to get a referral for specialty care, get that referral approved by a regional contractor and then wait to hear back before they can book an appointment. CareSource evaluated whether any legal obstacles stood in the way and decided to axe the process.

“It was a no-brainer,” Ms. Joers said. “This makes sense to us. Can we do it logistically? Yes. Are there any barriers statutorily? No.”

She said CareSource chose Tampa as an initial market because of its healthcare infrastructure, a military base that draws service members and a retiree population. Integrated Home Care Services will act as one of the plan’s partners in Florida. The insurer will also offer the plan in Atlanta. Ms. Joers noted that both areas have “strong military and veteran communities, robust healthcare infrastructure and a wide variety of population needs.”

As for other insurers considering entering the Tricare market, Ms. Joers sees an opportunity.

“We’re hearing a lot from the government now about wanting to bring more commercial entities into the space,” she said.

In terms of what next steps Ms. Joers sees for CareSource’s Tricare push, she said she is “expecting there to be an opportunity to compete for more locations, so we’re excited to be able to do that and just continue to build on this managed care, integrated care model.”",https://www.beckerspayer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/payer-og-image.png,N,1.0,2025-12-05 20:56:43.608573

MEADE, Md.– Fort Meade Medical Department Activity (MEDDAC) leaders and staff celebrated the newest DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses honorees during a ceremony held at the Fort Meade MEDDAC Headquarters on Fort Meade, Maryland, Dec. 5, 2025.

Virginia Peters, Lynnette Petty, and Army Spc. Steven Miller were selected from 35 nominations to receive the award.

The DAISY award, which stands for Diseases Attacking the Immune System, recognizes nurses who provide exceptional care and compassion by collecting nominations from patients, families, and co-workers.

Leaders at the ceremony emphasized the impact and importance of the award in the nursing profession.

“The DAISY award is a special award because it reminds us of why many of us joined this profession in the first place,” said Army Lt. Col. Derral W. Prowant, Kimbrough’s chief nursing officer. “Healing is more than medicine. It is connection, trust, and presence.”

“The DAISY Award is so special because it’s not a top-down award,” said Army Col. Louis Magyar III, Fort Meade MEDDAC’s deputy commander for nursing. “To be recognized by our patients–by the people that we care for and that they’ve entrusted us to care for them–is probably one of the most [important] recognitions that you could ever receive as a healthcare provider,” Maygar added.

Peters, a registered nurse at the Dunham Army Health Clinic, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, was nominated by a patient after Peters provided thorough patient support during appointments, addressed concerns, and enhanced the patient’s understanding with a home medical device. Peters made the patient feel valued and cared for throughout the process. “She is undoubtedly one of the best nurses that I have ever experienced,” according to the patient.

Petty, a licensed practical nurse at Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, Fort Meade, Maryland, was nominated by a grateful patient who highlighted Petty’s “outstanding professionalism,” sharing that she “immediately took actions” and even escorted them to the pharmacy to secure a time-sensitive prescription. The patient called her support “above and beyond” and credited her “compassion and determination” for resolving the issue.

Miller, a combat medic specialist at Kirk Army Health Clinic, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, was nominated by a patient who commended Miller for being “an exceptional medic” whose professionalism and thorough review of hospital notes and history showed “the absolute intent of getting me [the patient] help.” The patient added that he is a credit to his profession and to Kirk Army Health Clinic.

The DAISY Award is part of an international program that celebrates nurses who go above and beyond to provide exceptional patient care. Nominees are selected based on patient, family, and staff submissions describing meaningful moments of clinical excellence and compassion.

Winners received a certificate, pin, and “The Healer’s Touch” serpentine stone sculpture, which is hand-carved by artists of the Shona Tribe in Zimbabwe who hold their traditional healers in high esteem.

(WRIC) — A Chester laboratory has agreed to pay $758,000 to settle allegations of illegal kickbacks to doctors and marketers, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).

The clinical laboratory NEXT Bio-Research Services LLC, doing business as NEXT of Chester, allegedly paid kickbacks to induce laboratory testing referrals, paid knowingly and willfully, per the DOJ.

NEXT allegedly paid doctors in Texas and Arkansas thousands of dollars in kickbacks disguised as consulting fees and medical director fees. However, in reality, the department said these payments were actually offered to induce the doctors to order NEXT laboratory tests.

The company also allegedly paid commissions to certain independent contractor marketers based on the volume and value of referrals to ensure that doctors order NEXT laboratory tests.

The anti-kickback statute prohibits offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded health care programs, per the DOJ. This law aims to ensure that medical providers’ judgments are in their patients’ best interests.

“This settlement shows DOJ’s commitment to rooting out illegal kickback schemes that have no place in our federal health care programs,” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department is committed to pursuing these important investigations and health care fraud enforcement across the board.”

The Defense Health Agency announced Nov. 13 that three military hospitals from Defense Health Network Central earned Leapfrog's Top Hospital recognition for fall 2025.

Bassett Army Community Hospital earned honors for a second year in a row, along with new honors for Osan Air Base's 51st Medical Group and Yokota Air Base's 374th Medical Group.

""Receiving the Leapfrog Top Hospital Award is a remarkable achievement and a testament to DHN Central MTFs’ unwavering commitment to patient safety and the exceptional quality of care you provide to our patients,"" said Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central. ""This prestigious designation recognizes the outstanding performance in critical areas such as error prevention and superior outcomes, setting these MTFs apart as three of only 12 MTFs across the enterprise to receive the recognition in 2025.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

Leapfrog's Top Hospital award recognizes the highest-performing hospitals on the Leapfrog Hospital Survey, identifying those with strong performance in patient safety and quality. Hospitals are recognized across four categories: general, teaching, rural, and children's hospitals, and must achieve an ""A"" grade in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade to be eligible. These hospitals demonstrate superior systems for preventing medication errors, higher quality maternity care, and lower infection rates, among other standards, according to the Leapfrog Group’s website.

Bassett Army Community Hospital

This honor marks Bassett's second consecutive year receiving the Top Hospital honor.

""Our team at Bassett Army Community Hospital not only strives to deliver safe, quality care, but we do it the right way – through teamwork, professionalism, and mutual support across sections,"" said Air Force Col. Benjamin Donham, Bassett Army Community Hospital commander.

""Being recognized for earning the Leapfrog Top Hospital for the second year in a row shows the commitment our team has to our community, beneficiaries, and each other.""'

Osan Air Base Hospital

""We are immensely proud that Osan Air Base Hospital is recognized as a Leapfrog Top Hospital. This prestigious designation is a testament to the unwavering dedication and commitment of our entire staff who worked diligently and collaboratively to meet and exceed the stringent national standards,"" said Air Force Col. Amanda L. Siangco, 51st Medical Group director.

""This achievement underscores our ongoing commitment to providing the highest quality and safest care to our patients and the community we serve.""

Yokota Military Hospital

Yokota Military Hospital also made the fall ""honor roll.""

""Yokota Air Base Hospital's prestigious selection as a Leapfrog Top Hospital belongs entirely to its remarkable team,"" said Air Force Col. Graham I. Warden, 474th Medical Group director. ""It was their tireless hard work, seamless collaboration, and relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and the highest standards that made this national recognition possible.""

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation fosters transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and health care systems, leading to continual process improvement.

“This recognition reflects your tireless efforts, represents the highest standards of excellence, and reflects positively on our entire Network, the Defense Health Agency, and the Military Health System. You are setting a phenomenal example for others to follow,"" Harrell concluded.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/05/2003837633/1920/1080/0/250828-A-HM783-1079.JPG,N,0.0,2025-12-05 15:56:47.656211

Individuals need to be aware of specific dates for the Tricare open season and the Federal Benefits Open Season to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare options.

Tricare Open Season

The Tricare open season will conclude on Tuesday, December 9, at midnight Eastern Standard Time. During this period, beneficiaries have the opportunity to make essential changes to their Tricare healthcare plans, including the option to switch between Tricare Prime and Tricare Select. It is recommended that beneficiaries visit tricare.mil/openseason to compare costs and plans, with online enrollment available through the Beneficiary Web Enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil.

For those who do not make any changes during this open season, the next opportunity to alter their plan will not occur until next year’s open season or following a qualifying life event, such as a birth. It’s crucial for beneficiaries to verify their information by checking the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System at tricare.mil/deers.

This year’s open season introduces a notable change for beneficiaries residing in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida metropolitan areas. A demonstration project will offer a Tricare Prime option without the requirement of referrals to in-network specialists, a significant shift that aims to enhance access to healthcare services. New coverage or changes selected will become effective on January 1, 2026.

The Tricare open season applies to individuals currently enrolled or eligible for various Tricare plans, including Tricare Prime and Tricare Select. Notably, individual active-duty service members and beneficiaries enrolled in Tricare for Life are exempt from this open season, as their coverage is automatically granted for those with Medicare Part A and Part B. Those eligible for premium-based plans like Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve can enroll at any time throughout the year.

Dental, Vision, and Tax-Saving Accounts

The Federal Benefits Open Season will end on Monday, December 8, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Eligible military community members can enroll in dental and vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) at www.benefeds.gov. Additionally, service members can enroll in tax-savings accounts during this period, including a healthcare flexible spending account and a dependent care flexible spending account. These accounts allow individuals to set aside pre-tax dollars for healthcare costs not covered by Tricare and additional expenses associated with child care. It is important to note that previous participation does not automatically carry over, requiring new enrollment each year.

New Tricare Prime Demonstration

Starting in 2026, approximately 150,000 Tricare beneficiaries in the Atlanta and Tampa areas will gain access to the new Tricare Prime demonstration project initiated by the Defense Health Agency. Beneficiaries who wish to participate must enroll during the open season. Further information can be obtained by visiting enrolltricare.com or by calling 877-996-9333.

The CareSource Military and Veterans Company, based in Dayton, Ohio, will manage the three-year demonstration project under contracts totaling $110 million. This initiative will serve active-duty family members, family members of activated National Guard or Reserve members, retirees, and certain other individuals not eligible for Medicare. A key benefit of this new option is the elimination of referral requirements for in-network specialty care.

Feedback from beneficiaries regarding the Tricare Prime demonstration has been largely positive, particularly concerning the new allowance to access specialists without referrals. CareSource aims to provide robust support, helping families navigate healthcare options and appointments.

For military families seeking to optimize their healthcare coverage for the upcoming year, adhering to these deadlines and exploring the available options is essential for ensuring comprehensive and accessible medical services.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Upcoming-Health-Care-Enrollment-Deadlines-for-US-Military-Community.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-05 13:56:47.208840

Clear and dependable communication is essential for military families stationed abroad,” said Congressman Bacon.
“Our military readiness depends upon our operational readiness, and this commonsense bipartisan bill will strengthen both.” “When military families receive the right information at the right time, they stay resilient, informed, and mission ready,” Rep. Horsford said.
I’m proud to partner with Representatives Houlahan, Bacon, Kiggans, Goodlander and Wittman to help give military families the consistent, direct, and timely communication they deserve.” “Ensuring that our service members have access to reliable, consistent communication is essential for military readiness.
For those stationed in Okinawa, timely updates can make all the difference in their day-to-day lives and provide stability for their families.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA), along with original co-sponsors Representatives Steven Horsford (D-NV), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Don Bacon (R-NE), and Rob Wittman (R-VA), introduced the Improving Notification for Operational Readiness and Families (INFORM) Act, a bipartisan bill directing the Department of Defense (DoD) to establish a pilot program to deliver timely, mission-critical information directly to servicemembers and military families stationed at Marine Corps Installations Pacific in Okinawa, Japan.

Under the bill, DoD will automatically enroll eligible servicemembers and adult dependents to receive text messages providing updates on spouse employment opportunities, childcare availability, TRICARE benefits, and Department-wide policy changes. The initiative, which provides the option to opt out, aims to streamline communication and reduce reliance on fragmented channels such as social media, newsletters, and installation-specific platforms.

The bill also directs DoD to report to Congress by October 1, 2027, on participation, outcomes, costs, and whether the program should be expanded Department-wide. By consolidating routine updates into a single, efficient push-text system, the initiative is expected to reduce duplicative outreach efforts and improve long-term communication efficiency.

“Military families deserve clear, consistent, and reliable communication, especially those stationed overseas,” said Representative Chrissy Houlahan. “Our bill ensures that servicemembers and their families on Okinawa get the information they need directly to their phones, without having to dig through multiple systems or outdated channels. As a former Air Force officer and daughter of a naval officer, I know how much this simple, modern approach to getting timely information can improve quality of life and readiness.”

""Having served overseas with my own family, I know firsthand that clear and timely communication can make all the difference. Whether it’s childcare availability, TRICARE updates, or family resources, our servicemembers stationed in Okinawa deserve information they can rely on. The Push-Text Initiative will deliver that support directly to their phones, strengthening both family stability and mission readiness,” said Congresswoman Kiggans.

“Our servicemembers and their families are relying on increasingly diverse sources of information, and they deserve to be met where they are at. Clear and dependable communication is essential for military families stationed abroad,” said Congressman Bacon. “I’m pleased to co-lead the INFORM Act with Rep. Houlahan, to establish a DoD pilot delivering timely and relevant text updates to servicemembers and dependents in Okinawa. I am hopeful that the success of this program will lead to adoption across the force.”

“When America’s servicemembers answer the call to serve our country overseas, military families serve right alongside them. They need and deserve clear, reliable communication they can count on, especially when they are thousands of miles from home,” said Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander. “Our military readiness depends upon our operational readiness, and this commonsense bipartisan bill will strengthen both.”

“When military families receive the right information at the right time, they stay resilient, informed, and mission ready,” Rep. Horsford said. “If we can track flights, packages, and banking in real time, families should be able to track TRICARE deadlines and childcare openings just as easily. The pilot program we’re proposing today does just that, proving that smart, modern communication doesn’t have to be complicated, and that small changes can have big quality-of-life benefits for service members and their families. I’m proud to partner with Representatives Houlahan, Bacon, Kiggans, Goodlander and Wittman to help give military families the consistent, direct, and timely communication they deserve.”

“Ensuring that our service members have access to reliable, consistent communication is essential for military readiness. For those stationed in Okinawa, timely updates can make all the difference in their day-to-day lives and provide stability for their families. I’m proud to cosponsor the INFORM Act, which will ensure that the brave men and women serving our nation, as well as their families, have access to the resources they need to stay informed and connected,” said Congressman Wittman.

The proposal also carries significant national security implications. During major contingency scenarios, such as a crisis involving China, commercial communications systems in Okinawa could be disrupted. By building a controlled, state-side-managed communications capability, the bill lays the groundwork for a more resilient information pipeline that can operate even if local infrastructure is compromised. “This bipartisan pilot is a crucial step toward making sure no family is left without critical updates when it matters most. That’s not just good communication policy, its readiness,” Representative Chrissy Houlahan said.

In addition to the government’s complaint, five private whistleblower lawsuits were joined under the False Claims Act.","The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has announced a $37.76 million settlement with CVS Pharmacy, Inc. to resolve allegations that the company violated the False Claims Act by over-dispensing insulin pens and improperly billing federal health care programs.

The settlement, approved by US District Judge John G. Koeltl, includes $24.4 million to be paid to the United States, with the remaining funds distributed to participating states.

CVS admitted to dispensing more insulin to patients than prescribed, submitting premature refill claims, and under-reporting days-of-supply data to secure reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

Findings and Admissions

According to the US Attorney’s Office, the conduct occurred between 2010 and 2020. During that period, CVS pharmacies:

Dispensed quantities of insulin exceeding prescription directions.

Refilled prescriptions prematurely, before patients had used prior supplies.

Reported inaccurate days-of-supply on reimbursement claims, preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from detecting early refills.

Failed to follow PBM rules requiring overrides or resubmissions with accurate supply data.

CVS management was aware of audit findings showing violations related to premature refills and inaccurate reporting but did not implement adequate corrective actions during the covered period.

CVS admitted that its pharmacies sometimes did not break open insulin pen cartons, leading to dispensing amounts beyond plan limits, and that its auto-refill system occasionally generated premature refill notifications based on inaccurate supply data.

Statements from Federal Officials

US Attorney Jay Clayton described CVS’s conduct as a “decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions”, noting that the company’s failure to follow appropriate refill schedules increased costs for government programs and wasted taxpayer funds.

He emphasized that the settlement “reflects our continued commitment to holding pharmacies to account, enforcing rules designed to keep costs down, and protecting taxpayer dollars.”

Officials from the HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), and the Office of Personnel Management OIG (OPM-OIG) underscored the importance of compliance with federal billing standards:

HHS-OIG’s Naomi D. Gruchacz stated that federal health programs depend on accurate billing and responsible reimbursement practices.

DCIS Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Silvestro reaffirmed that investigating false claims against TRICARE remains a top priority.

OPM-OIG Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt noted that false claims for unnecessary insulin refills “exploit benefits that federal employees rely on to manage their health.”

Background on Insulin Dispensing Practices

The case centered on insulin pens, which are packaged in five-pen cartons, each containing 300 units of insulin. Pharmacies are required to report the quantity dispensed and days-of-supply when seeking reimbursement.

Government health care programs and PBMs limit the days-of-supply that can be billed (often 30 days) and deny premature refill claims. These safeguards depend on accurate pharmacy reporting.

The government alleged that CVS manipulated or misreported supply data, which prevented PBMs from detecting violations. The result was over-dispensing, leading some patients to accumulate unused and potentially expired insulin.

Resolution and Oversight

As part of the settlement, CVS admitted to the conduct alleged in the government’s complaint and accepted responsibility. The company will pay $37.76 million in total.

The government’s case was handled by the Civil Frauds Unit of the US Attorney’s Office, led by Assistant US Attorney Pierre Armand, with investigative support from HHS-OIG, DCIS, OPM-OIG, the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and the US Postal Service OIG.

In addition to the government’s complaint, five private whistleblower lawsuits were joined under the False Claims Act.

First, for 2026, the Soldier will pay premiums of $57.88 for an individual plan or $286.66 for a family plan. The premium is the monthly amount paid for the insurance.

Second, the deductible varies by rank. For E-4 and below, the deductible is $66 for an individual or $132 for a family. For E-5 and above, the individual deductible is $198 and the family deductible is $397. A deductible is the amount that the Soldier pays before Tricare pays anything.

Third, once the deductible is met, cost-sharing kicks in. The amounts vary by the type of provider, but as an example, primary care visits are $19. Specialty care is $33. Urgent care is $26, etc. See the link below for costs.

Fourth, there is a catastrophic cap. This means that once the service member has paid a certain amount of money for care (deductible, copays, etc.), then everything is covered at 100%. The catastrophic cap for TRS next year is $1324.

If you want to explain to a Soldier how it all works, make sure and let them know that total out of pocket costs for the year would be 12 months of premiums, plus the catastrophic cap. For example, a junior enlisted would pay $694.56 in premiums ($57.88 x 12 months), plus the catastrophic cap of $1324, for a total annual out of pocket cost of $2018.56.

Its also important to note that prescription costs count towards the deductible and catastrophic cap. Some health plans have a separate deductible for prescriptions.

Dental is separate and is through Tricare United Concordia Dental Plan.

A Virginia-based clinical laboratory will pay at least $758,000 to resolve federal allegations that it funneled illegal kickbacks to physicians and marketers to generate test referrals. Prosecutors say NEXT Molecular Analytics disguised improper payments as consulting or medical director fees for doctors in Texas and Arkansas, while also compensating independent marketers based on the volume and value of test orders — actions that allegedly led to claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE.

Newly synthesized fungal compound shows early promise against pediatric brain cancer

MIT chemists have, for the first time, created verticillin A in the lab — a notoriously complex fungal molecule that has intrigued cancer researchers for decades. With reliable access to the compound, the team was able to design sturdier versions that Dana-Farber scientists then tested in diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a devastating childhood brain cancer with limited treatment options. Some of these derivatives were strikingly effective at killing DMG cells, particularly those driven by high EZHIP expression.

While the work, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, is still at a very early stage, researchers say having a practical way to make and modify verticillin A opens the door to deeper studies.

Study projects climate-driven sleep loss by 2099

Nighttime heat may become a significant public health stressor, according to a large analysis from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, published in Environment International, that links rising temperatures to shorter and more fragmented sleep in U.S. adults. Using more than 12 million FitBit-recorded nights from over 14,000 participants, investigators found that a 10°C (50°F) rise in nighttime temperatures corresponded to 2.6 minutes of lost sleep, with disproportionate effects among women, Hispanic individuals, people with chronic illness and those of lower socioeconomic status.
