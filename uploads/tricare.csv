Some doctors and health care providers in San Antonio who rely on TRICARE to pay for services provided to military members and dependents say they are now starting to feel the pinch.

The Democrats’ stated priority of extending federal subsidies related to Obamacare coverage may now be endangering the health care services for United States military service members, retirees, and their dependents. Although the financial hardships facing medical providers who rely on TRICARE are of nationwide concern, the issue is perhaps more visible in San Antonio, often referred to as “Military City USA” due to the number of Department of War installations located within the city.

San Antonio is home to Joint Base San Antonio, the U.S. military’s largest joint base operation that includes Lackland Air Force Base, Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, and Camp Bullis. Soldiers and Airmen assigned to the bases and their families rely on TRICARE to reimburse civilian health care providers who are now feeling the financial impact of the shutdown. Military retirees also rely on TRICARE insurance for healthcare needs.

Vance warns ‘deeper’ cuts ahead for federal workers as shutdown enters 12th dayBy STEVE PEOPLESAP National Politics WriterThe Associated Press

Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said there will be deeper cuts to the federal workforce the longer the government shutdown goes on, adding to the uncertainty facing hundreds of thousands who are already furloughed without pay amid the stubborn stalemate in Congress.

Vance warned that as the federal shutdown entered its 12th day, the new cuts would be “painful,” even as he said the Trump administration worked to ensure that the military is paid this week and some services would be preserved for low-income Americans, including food assistance.

Still, hundreds of thousands of government workers have been furloughed in recent days and, in a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees would soon be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

“The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we’re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.”

Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the aggressive move by President Donald Trump ’s budget office, which goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown, further inflaming tensions between the Republicans who control Congress and the Democratic minority.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions.

Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first.

For now, negotiations are virtually nonexistent. Dug in as ever, House leaders from both parties pointed fingers at each other in rival Sunday appearances on “Fox News Sunday.”

“We have repeatedly made clear that we will sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. “Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It’s unfortunate they’ve taken a my-way-or-the-highway approach.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats and said they “seem not to care” about the pain the shutdown is inflicting.

“They’re trying their best to distract the American people from the simple fact that they’ve chosen a partisan fight so that they can prove to their Marxist rising base in the Democratic Party that they’re willing to fight Trump and Republicans,” he said.

Progressive activists, meanwhile, expressed new support for the Democratic Party’s position in the shutdown fight.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he is “feeling good about the strength of Dem position.” He pointed to fractures in the GOP, noting that Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly warned last week that health care insurance premiums would skyrocket for average Americans — including her own adult children — if nothing is done.

“Trump and GOP are rightfully taking the blame for the shutdown and for looming premium increases,” Levin said. “Their chickens are coming home to roost.”

And yet the Republican administration and its congressional allies are showing no signs of caving to Democratic demands or backing away from threats to use the opportunity to pursue deeper cuts to the federal workforce.

Thousands of employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, are set to receive layoff notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers.

“You hear a lot of Senate Democrats say, well, how can Donald Trump possibly lay off all of these federal workers?” Vance said. “Well, the Democrats have given us a choice between giving low-income women their food benefits and paying our troops on the one hand, and, on the other hand, paying federal bureaucrats.”

Democrats say the firings are illegal and unnecessary.

“They do not have to do this,” said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “They do not have to punish people that shouldn’t find themselves in this position.”",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/wi/ap/trump-35230-trump-vice-president-jd-vance-speaks-reporters-james-brady-press-briefing-at-white-hous-640x335.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-12 17:56:33.584512

“Pink Pony Club is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip,” DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, according to TMZ.

Roan has pushed political views before. She has been a huge supporter of the radical transgendering of America’s youth, even donating a portion of every ticket sales to “charities” that push the trans agenda.

Last year, the Missouri-bred singer dedicated her first-ever VMA win to “all the queer kids in the Midwest,” adding, “I am one of you.”

Roan has also used her platform to attack Jews and to show her support for Hamas and Palestinians, an act that HBO host Bill Maher especially scoffed at. He noted that the rabidly queer singer would be the first person Hamas would “throw off a roof” if they had their way because radical Islamists vehemently hate gays.

Ex-NFL QB Mark Sanchez released from custody a week after parking fight arrest and stabbingThe Associated PressINDIANAPOLIS

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Former NFL quarterback and sports analyst Mark Sanchez was released from custody Sunday, about a week after police said he was stabbed during a fight with a truck driver outside an Indiana hotel.

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Sanchez’s release. He faces a felony battery charge, along with several misdemeanor charges, for what prosecutors have said was a fight over parking.

A police affidavit says the 38-year-old Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted 69-year-old Perry Tole, who had backed his truck into a hotel’s loading docks in downtown Indianapolis on Oct. 4. Tole claims in a lawsuit filed Monday that Sanchez entered the truck without permission, then physically blocked and shoved Tole, who then doused Sanchez with pepper spray.

When Sanchez advanced after being sprayed, Tole pulled a knife to defend himself, authorities said.

Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, according to a police affidavit. A picture of Tole circulating online shows him in a neck brace on a hospital bed, covered in blood with a deep slash to the side of his face.

Sanchez was in Indianapolis for Fox’s coverage of last Sunday’s game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.

Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the New York Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.

He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.

Kristina Johnson's family is one such family. Her husband is in the Navy. They live in Virginia Beach. News 3 met Johnson as she was taking her three-year-old daughter, Sophia, to receive applied behavior analysis services.

Applied behavior analysis, or ABA, is a type of therapy for people with autism.

It helps Sophia identify things and communicate her wants and needs. But the therapy isn’t easy to come by for military families.

“I think it’s definitely stressful,"" Johnson said about the struggle to get her daughter the service.

TRICARE, the military's health insurance provider, doesn’t offer ABA as a basic service like many civilian insurance providers do. That means military families have more steps to go through to get the services.

A frustrating hurdle for families, knowing how beneficial the services can be.

“Ever since she’s started, she’s grown and hit milestones that I know if she were not here I would be, like, ‘What am I supposed to do about this?’"" Johnson said.

In September, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on the study the organization did of the military health care system’s current process for providing the services.

One goal of the study was to determine if TRICARE should offer ABA as a basic service. According to the report, the answer is yes.

Johnson is excited.

“I grew up with a nephew and a brother who are on the spectrum and saw how my parents kind of struggled with that,"" Johnson explained.

The report also recommends ways to improve ABA policy, implementation, and oversight.

“It’s a fantastic step. It’s a huge step in the right direction,"" National Coalition for Access to Autism Services representative Julie Kornack.

The NCAAS is a national advocacy organization. Kornack also works for the Center for Autism and Related Disorders.

“a I’m hopeful that the Congressional Autism Caucus and the many members of that do see this report and decide that they can put some pressure on the Department of Defense or take other action,"" Kornack said.

In the meantime, Johnson has this message for families considering ABA.

But, I think pouring that investment into your child is the best love that you can try to get,"" Johnson said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ad2f7e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1906x1001+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fca%2Faf%2F063a57ed48ef87c93f1811ffd46e%2Fscreenshot-2025-10-10-at-8-30-35-pm.png,N,0.0,2025-10-11 11:56:39.730726

But in recent years, Republicans have turned it into a vehicle for their favorite grievances—and this year is no exception.
At first, Senate Democrats blocked the measure.
The final vote passed easily, with the majority of Democrats joining all but three Republicans to approve the bill.
While the NDAA isn’t technically an appropriations bill, its annual passage and ties to defense funding make it an important bellwether.","Over the past two weeks, the shutdown fight has dominated Washington, leaving a stack of fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills waiting for their turn at the negotiating table. As LGBTQ+ people have watched nervously to see whether Democrats would hold the line against anti-trans and anti-queer riders, another “must-pass” measure has quietly advanced through Congress: the National Defense Authorization Act. In 2024, the NDAA became the vehicle for one of the most consequential betrayals of transgender Americans by national Democrats in recent memory, after Democrats allowed provisions targeting trans military family members and dependents to stand when they had control of the Senate and White House. This year, history is repeating itself. After weeks of delay amid the shutdown chaos, Senate Democrats on Tuesday night dropped key objections and allowed a vote to proceed on the bill—ultimately passing the Senate version of the bill, complete with anti-trans culture-war riders, an anti-DEI clause, and no limits on the domestic deployment of U.S. troops.

The bill, which cleared the Senate 77–20 last night, sets the rules for how the military operates and spends its money. Traditionally, the NDAA has avoided the culture-war baggage that weighs down other legislation. But in recent years, Republicans have turned it into a vehicle for their favorite grievances—and this year is no exception. The Senate version includes three key provisions targeting LGBTQ+ people: a ban on transgender participation in sports at military academies, extending even to visiting students in intercollegiate competitions; a prohibition on Defense Department funding for gender-affirming surgeries, which could also sweep in defense contractors as well as trans military spouses; and a measure gutting equal opportunity and diversity protections across the armed forces.

At first, Senate Democrats blocked the measure. But by Tuesday night, Republicans and Democrats had struck a deal to move it forward. Rather than demand that key provisions be stripped or amended, Democrats opted for a series of doomed amendment votes—symbolic gestures that allowed them to register dissent without altering the bill’s substance. Among them was a proposal from Sen. Tammy Duckworth to restrict the president’s ability to deploy U.S. troops on domestic soil without congressional approval, a flashpoint issue amid recent military mobilizations in major American cities. The final vote passed easily, with the majority of Democrats joining all but three Republicans to approve the bill.

Democratic senators voting in favor of the NDAA included Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland; Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado; Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut; Lisa Blunt Rochester and Chris Coons of Delaware; Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly of Arizona; Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia; Mazie Hirono of Hawaii; Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Jacky Rosen of Nevada; Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire; Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico; Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer of New York; John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island; and Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia.

Democratic senators who voted against or did not vote on the NDAA included Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin; Cory Booker and Andy Kim of New Jersey; Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray of Washington; Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin of Illinois; Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden of Oregon; Chris Murphy of Connecticut; Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff of California; Brian Schatz of Hawaii; Tina Smith of Minnesota; Chris Van Hollen of Maryland; and Peter Welch of Vermont. Independent senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont also voted no. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada did not vote.

The bill now heads into conference negotiations with the House, where the version passed earlier this year is loaded with even more anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ riders. Many of those measures were championed by Rep. Nancy Mace, who infamously launched into anti-trans slurs on the House floor during debate. The House provisions go far beyond the Senate’s, including an all-ages ban on military health insurance coverage for gender-affirming care, restrictions on transgender athletes at military facilities, a bathroom ban on bases, a ban on pride flags, and a clause excluding gender identity from all military data collection. According to Roll Call, the Senate’s passage sets the stage for formal conference talks where negotiators could fold some—or all—of the House provisions into the final bill. The legislation will then return to both chambers for final approval and will likely reach the president’s desk before year’s end.

The Senate’s capitulation on LGBTQ+, DEI, and other provisions may offer an early preview of its priorities in the broader shutdown fight. The government has now been shuttered for ten days, with Democrats and Republicans deadlocked over both a clean continuing resolution and full-year funding bills for 2026—many of which are packed with anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ riders. While the NDAA isn’t technically an appropriations bill, its annual passage and ties to defense funding make it an important bellwether. Earlier this month, as the shutdown loomed, LGBTQ+ advocates flooded congressional offices with calls urging lawmakers to strip anti-LGBTQ+ riders from all must-pass legislation. For now, those provisions take a backseat in the shutdown talks as such talks currently center primarily on a short-term continuing resolution—but the NDAA marks the first break in that line of defense, and it’s likely to test the limits of how far Democrats are willing to go to defend equality and civil rights when the fiscal year 2026 funding bills are finally negotiated.

The National Women’s Law Center condemned passage of the NDAA with the anti-trans and anti-DEI provisions in a press release this morning, stating, “Mere days before service members are set to miss a paycheck because of the government shutdown, Senate Republicans continue to ignore the national health care crisis and find new ways to inject ideological priorities into what should be bipartisan efforts to strengthen our armed forces and support military families. The NDAA bill includes harmful amendments that will deny gender-affirming surgical care to service members and adult dependents in military families, bar transgender women from sports at service academies, and gut protections that ensure equal opportunity. These measures are cruel, unnecessary, and do nothing to make our country safer. Instead, they hurt the very people who serve it and deter potential recruits from a career in service to this nation, ultimately weakening our military and compromising our national security. Such provisions that divide our military have no place in the final bill, and Congress must act to strip out these provisions before final passage.”

This is not the first time Senate Democrats have approved anti-transgender riders to national bills. In 2024, with control of the Senate and the Presidency, they passed a National Defense Authorization Act that contained a Tricare ban for gender affirming care for children dependents. Senate Leadership refused to hold a vote to remove that provision led by Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin, with GLAAD condemning the measure at the time.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0zGi!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93149be2-3ee9-4605-a458-6cb1ea49d469_3070x2048.jpeg",N,0.0,2025-10-10 17:56:43.139454

One Virginia Beach business told 10 On Your Side they are feeling the impacts of the ongoing shutdown because they say TRICARE isn’t paying up.

Speech at The Beach owner Ashley Causey said about 40% of their clientele use Tricare to pay. But she said they stopped receiving payments from the military insurance carrier around the time the government shutdown, without any warning.

“I was personally confused,” Causey said. “Like, is this happening to anyone else? Because I wasn’t hearing or seeing anything about it.”

Causey said they used to receive payments daily. She reached out to TRICARE, who she said told her that claims won’t be paid out until the shutdown ends.

She said the loss so far has been substantial.

“I just wanted to put it out there, because I don’t think many people know how impactful this is to everyone,” Causey said, “not just direct government employees, but also, maybe small businesses that accept TRICARE, or families that have TRICARE, it’s eventually going to impact them as well.”

This isn’t the first time local providers, including Causey, have had issues with Tricare.

10 On Your Side reported in the spring that a company named PGBA LLC began processing claims for the Tricare East Region, which caused many providers to go without pay and answers.

“Our payment was delayed and delayed and delayed,” Causey said, “and we realized it was because of the switch in payers. Again, it was very little communication. And I think that one took about two months to get some payments.”

The TRICARE website acknowledges that there could be potential delays in payment during the shutdown.

A spokesperson from Humana Military did send 10 On Your Side the following statement in response to our inquiry about the situation:

“Without knowing the specifics of each provider’s claims, we cannot comment on why their claims have not yet been paid. We are partnering with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to minimize the impact of the government shutdown as much as possible on providers and beneficiaries. Certain claims are paid directly by the government, and those will not generally be paid during the shutdown as there isn’t funding to pay them. Other claims are paid in advance by Humana Military and then Humana Military is paid back by the government. For those types of claims, Humana Military is continuing to pay providers. We recognize how challenging this is for providers and beneficiaries. We recommend providers continue to submit claims so Humana Military can make sure they’re processed and paid quickly once the shutdown ends.”

— Nan Frient, Communications Lead for Humana Military

Causey is hoping they can get payments soon.

“We are just monitoring things,” Causey said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to remain doing therapy as normal, but obviously that’s going to be something that we have to monitor financials to make sure that we can stay afloat as a small business.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/VB-BUSINESS-TRICARE-SHUTDOWN-ISSUES-LLPKG.00_00_28_19.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-10-10 12:57:28.090578
