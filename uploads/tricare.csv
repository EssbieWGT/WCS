Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It’s exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you’re doing vigorous exercise where you’re getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you’re still moving quite a bit, and that’s a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it’s also important to recognize that it’s fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don’t achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

“Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,” Franzos noted. “Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.”

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It’s just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We’ve taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzos said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they’re going to reinforce that, and they’re going to want you to prove to them that you’ve taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

“DHA leaders are investing in frontline staff and the future of military health care.","The Defense Health Agency is making a concerted effort to identify health system innovations from a particular group of the workforce: our frontline staff.

With the launch of the Innovation Fellowship Program, DHA is empowering civilian and uniformed employees at military hospitals and clinics to solve real-world problems they face every day—by offering time, funding, and a network of mentors to help bring their ideas to life.

This program flips the script on other top-down initiatives that may miss critical on-the-ground context. “Far too often, enterprise innovations overlook the lived experience of frontline staff,” said Dr. Rebecca Rough, chief innovation officer of DHA. “This program recognizes true innovations start with those closest to the problem.”

Turning ideas into action

Prospective fellows are invited to submit “pitches” to target specific issues in their daily work. Selected fellows receive financial support to explore and test solutions and are granted twelve months with up to 25% of their work time protected to focus on their projects. Financial backing includes up to $10,000 for training and concept changes, and as much as $150,000 to develop and test prototypes.

But support doesn’t stop at funding. Fellows work with subject matter experts and mentors from across the DHA enterprise to help refine, implement, and potentially scale their ideas.

More than innovation—a culture shift

The Innovation Fellowship Program is designed to improve patient care and streamline operations. More importantly, it fosters a culture where everyday problem-solvers are inspired to lead change.

“DHA leaders are investing in frontline staff and the future of military health care. This program is designed to improve the system and enable to make a tangible difference,” said Dr. Pauline Swiger, the fellowship’s program director.

By providing structure, resources, and a pathway to innovate, DHA hopes to unlock creative potential at all levels of the organization—and demonstrate good ideas don’t need to come from the top to make a big impact.

“This program is just as much about inspiring and engaging the innovators out there on the ground as it is about the innovation itself” said U.S. Army Major Taylor Neuman, acting chief workforce well-being and engagement officer of DHA.

,,2025-07-21 14:39:25+00:00,Louisiana Illuminator,Local pharmacies can serve veterans — if the system lets them - Louisiana Illuminator,"David Osborn, Dr. Rachel Bervell, Dr. James Ellis, Kathy Oubre",,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/07/21/pharmacies-veterans/,"As chairman of the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, I’ve heard all sides of the debate over pharmacy benefit managers and their role in our industry.
It’s a system designed to limit access exclusively to the benefit of the pharmacy benefit manager.
Fortunately, the more than 600 independent pharmacies throughout Louisiana stand ready and able to serve our veterans and military families — if only the system would let us.
Veterans and military families have earned a health care system that prioritizes their needs, not corporate profits.
Whatever direction Louisiana pharmacy benefit manager reform takes, I hope we continue to focus on what works — and who it really works for.","As chairman of the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, I’ve heard all sides of the debate over pharmacy benefit managers and their role in our industry. And lately, since Louisiana lawmakers discussed banning pharmacy benefit managers from owning their own pharmacies, I’ve heard arguments that such a ban would somehow harm military families, especially those who use Tricare.

But those arguments overlook a simple fact: for many military families, access to quality pharmaceutical care is already broken, and the pharmacy benefit managers helped break it.

The original purpose of these corporate middlemen was to negotiate drug prices and help lower costs. But today, companies like Express Scripts — a Cigna Group-owned company that has held the exclusive Tricare pharmacy contract since 2009 — use their unmatched power to control both the benefit and the pharmacy. They steer patients into their own mail-order operations like Accredo, a subsidiary of Express Scripts, reaping immense profits at the expense of locally operated, small-business pharmacies.

Consider that in August 2022 alone, more than 15,000 pharmacies left the Tricare network after the pharmacy benefit managers offered reimbursement contracts that didn’t even cover the cost of dispensing medication. That shift impacted more than 400,000 military families who were forced to choose between going out of network and paying higher costs or using PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies that offer little to no customer support and are prone to delays.

So when critics worry that if Louisiana were to restrict PBM pharmacy ownership, it would cause pharmacy closures and disrupt veteran care, I shake my head. It is the pharmacy benefit managers — not independent pharmacies — that are already doing this by forcing providers out of the Tricare network and reimbursing non-PBM competitors — our brick-and-mortar small businesses — at such insignificant rates that they cannot survive. It’s a system designed to limit access exclusively to the benefit of the pharmacy benefit manager.

What often gets lost in these conversations is what care actually looks like at the community level. Despite these network restrictions, Tricare patients still walk into Louisiana’s independently operated pharmacies seeking care because of the poor service they’ve experienced at the hands of the PBM mail-order pharmacy. Their medications may be lost, delayed indefinitely or spoiled in transit, and they’ve grown tired of trying to get help through a distant PBM call center. In some cases, these patients are happy to go out of network and pay out of pocket because the cash price is lower than what Express Scripts would charge. They choose local care not only because it costs less, but because it’s safer, faster and more personal.

Fortunately, the more than 600 independent pharmacies throughout Louisiana stand ready and able to serve our veterans and military families — if only the system would let us. We have the training and the community relationships to provide high-quality care. But as long as pharmacy benefit managers are allowed to both set the reimbursement rate and steer patients to their own pharmacies, we’ll never have the chance to compete fairly.

At the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, we’re happy that Gov. Jeff Landry and state legislators are having meaningful conversations about reform, and we are eager to be part of a solution that provides all patients fair prices, local access and better care. We think the best solution will be built on access, transparency and real accountability — not vertical integration and self-dealing.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center’s Pediatric Primary Care and Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Medicine clinics are here to help with routine wellness visits and acute care needs for patients from birth through age 25. These clinics offer flexible appointment options, including early bird, evening, Saturday, and virtual visits – making it easier for busy families to fit in the care their children need.

Support a Healthy School Year

For a smooth transition into the classroom, it’s important that children and teens are up to date on wellness exams and immunizations. It is just as critical to make sure they are getting adequate sleep, nutritious meals, regular physical activity, play time, and healthy limits on screen time.

“Plan healthy lunches that include proteins, fruits, veggies, and most importantly, foods your child likes to eat!” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) Elizabeth Simmons, chief of Pediatric Primary Care at Walter Reed.

Simmons also encourages families to explore the Healthy Habits program designed for children ages 6-18 who may benefit from support developing weight-management routines.

“Although the focus is on the child, the program is an all-inclusive effort to help the entire family become healthier. Healthy Habits are changes for life!” she said. “We encourage kids to keep regular routines to minimize back-to-school anxiety. We have behavioral health psychologists on staff who can help if there are any concerns.”

Caring for Teens and Young Adults

The AYA Medicine Clinic sees patients from ages 12-25 and helps bridge the gap between pediatric and adult care.

U.S. Army Maj. (Dr.) Saira Ahmed, service chief for Walter Reed’s AYA Medicine Clinic, highlights the importance of helping teens take charge of their health.

“[We recommend] promoting medical autonomy for adolescents and young adults — getting them ready for adulthood when they must start managing their own health care. We can also help with issues related to academic performance, screen time, and safety and injury prevention,” Ahmed said.

If your child has had a well visit in the past 12 months, school forms can be submitted through the patient portal without scheduling an additional appointment. It is advised, however, to check with your child’s school as some paperwork may require updated immunizations or physicals.

What to Cover Before School Starts

Well visits are a good time to check on your child’s:

• Growth (height, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol)

• School and sports readiness

• Mental and emotional well-being

• Medications and refills

• Healthy habits and nutrition goals

For teens and young adults, providers may also cover:

• Puberty and development changes

• Cervical cancer screenings (females ages 21-25)

• Birth control and reproductive health

Immunizations by age:

• Age 4: DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis), IPV (polio), MMR

(measles-mumps-rubella), Varicella (chickenpox)

• Age 9: HPV series (human papilloma)

• Age 11: HPV, Men ACWY #1 (meningitis), Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis)

• Age 16: Men ACWY #2 (meningitis booster)

• Ages 16-18: Men B series

In addition, FraudNet supported over 50 internal requests for support from GAO teams conducting audits and investigations.

Why This Matters

FraudNet’s primary mission is to facilitate the reporting of alleged fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement involving federal funds. It also supports GAO audits and investigations. This is the overview of FraudNet’s activities for fiscal year 2024.

FraudNet Processed over 5,780 Allegations in Fiscal Year 2024

Complainants, which can include the public, government employees and contractors, submitted over 5,780 allegations to FraudNet in fiscal year 2024. As shown in the figure below, the number of allegations FraudNet processed in fiscal year 2024 was higher than prior years, with the exception of fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2022, more than half of the allegations received were associated with social media campaigns that resulted in multiple complainants submitting form letters alleging the same fraud. This type of allegation was not prevalent in fiscal year 2024.

Allegations in fiscal year 2024 included those complainants categorized as mismanagement, waste, or misappropriation of government funds; ethics/conflict of interest/misconduct; false statements/claims; and embezzlement.

FraudNet’s Investigative Research Analysts review and document every allegation received. If FraudNet analysts determine an allegation should be referred elsewhere, possibly for investigation, they send it to federal Offices of the Inspector General (OIG) or other federal, state, and local entities as appropriate. Those entities then determine whether and how they will address an allegation.

Of the total allegations received in fiscal year 2024, FraudNet referred over 2,100 allegations to approximately 60 entities. These included the Department of Justice, and OIGs at the Department of Defense and the Treasury. For over 270 allegations, complainants indicated that they had sent the same allegation to entities other than GAO, and there were also approximately 590 complaints that were flagged as duplicates by FraudNet analysts. In such instances, FraudNet generally did not refer the allegation to those other entities to avoid duplicating efforts

FraudNet Analysts Provided Research Support to GAO Audits and Investigations

In fiscal year 2024, FraudNet analysts supported over 50 requests from GAO teams conducting audits and investigations. These requests involved analysts researching individuals and businesses.

For example, FraudNet analysts obtained publicly available information to support a GAO audit related to TRICARE Network providers. The Department of Defense's TRICARE program offers health care to more than 9 million beneficiaries through DOD healthcare facilities and private healthcare providers. (GAO-24-106434). FraudNet’s work helped GAO auditors identify practicing providers who had limited credentials, revoked credentials, and were ineligible to work for the TRICARE Network.

Anyone can contact FraudNet’s hotline to report suspected fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement of federal funds. The internet-based Complaint Form is the preferred reporting method. GAO cannot accept classified information via the website – please call (1-800-424-5454) for further guidance for allegations involving classified information.

When complainants submit an allegation through FraudNet’s website, they have the option to select the category that they think best describes their allegation. This selection can help FraudNet analysts evaluate allegations. The categories can also inform overall trend analysis. When FraudNet receives an allegation, the analysts do not edit or change it. Rather the analysts evaluate the allegation and, in some instances, follow up with the complainants for more information. The analysts then may determine that referral to another entity is appropriate. See the graphic below for good practices to follow when filing an allegation with FraudNet. GAO does not independently investigate allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse. However, FraudNet documents all allegations received in its case management system and makes them available to inform any ongoing or future GAO work.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-21 11:56:17.265483

Health Affairs, DHA, and the military departments have taken steps to monitor the available work time of military medical personnel in medical facilities.
Senate Report 118-58 includes a provision for GAO to review military medical personnel staffing at DOD medical facilities.","What GAO Found

The number of military medical positions and assigned personnel in Department of Defense (DOD) medical facilities has declined over time. Specifically, the number of authorized positions for military medical personnel declined by nearly 7 percent (63,179 to 58,945) from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2023. Likewise, assigned personnel declined by about 16 percent (60,479 to 50,590) during the same time. The decline in assigned personnel is in part attributable to fewer medical personnel in the Army, Navy, and Air Force (military departments). Senior leaders from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which manages medical facilities, stated they anticipate substantial shortfalls in military medical personnel until at least 2027 when personnel levels may increase.

To help address facility staffing challenges, DHA and the military departments implemented a collaborative process to staff medical facilities with military medical personnel. Pursuant to 2024 guidance from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (Health Affairs), DHA prioritized vacancies by facility and occupation, and the military departments identified personnel to fill them in 2025. DHA and the military departments are also collaborating to update medical facility personnel requirements for future years.

Health Affairs, DHA, and the military departments have taken steps to monitor the available work time of military medical personnel in medical facilities. The parties also agreed on how much time personnel would be expected to work in a facility as opposed to other military duties. These expectations vary depending on whether personnel are assigned exclusively to a facility.

Military Medical Personnel Categories and Annual Expected Medical Facility Work Time

To help ensure DOD meets these expectations, Health Affairs developed a monitoring tool that compares actual and expected work time by using medical facility timecard data from DHA. However, the monitoring tool is missing key information and relies on inaccurate and incomplete data. Specifically, the tool does not make key distinctions between facility work time and other time (e.g., deployments) or among personnel categories (e.g., exclusive vs. dual-assigned). Further, the tool relies on inaccurate and incomplete timecard data because DHA does not have a communication strategy, geared toward military medical personnel, that clarifies the importance of filling out timecards accurately, among other things. Until Health Affairs evaluates which activities count as facility work time in the tool and DHA communicates the importance of accurate timecard data, DOD will not have complete information to better monitor military medical personnel staffing at facilities.

Why GAO Did This Study

In 2023, DOD announced that its roughly 700 medical facilities have been chronically understaffed in recent years. The facilities are staffed primarily with military medical personnel and augmented with DOD civilian employees and private contractor employees.

Senate Report 118-58 includes a provision for GAO to review military medical personnel staffing at DOD medical facilities. This report describes (1) trends in military medical personnel staffing at the facilities from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2023; and evaluates the extent to which DOD has (2) a collaborative facility staffing process, and (3) taken steps to monitor the availability of personnel to work in medical facilities, among other things.

GAO reviewed DOD guidance and documentation and analyzed personnel data for fiscal years 2015 through 2023 and timecard data for fiscal year 2023. GAO also interviewed DOD officials and nearly 350 personnel from six medical facilities selected for site visits based on military department affiliation, location, and size.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-21 11:56:14.855766

Prevent Bigger Problems with Early, Conservative Care | New York Dental Clinic | Daegu Dental Clinic

Cavities may seem small, but if left untreated, they can rapidly progress—damaging deeper tooth layers, causing pain, and eventually requiring root canal therapy or even extraction. At New York Dental Clinic, a leading Daegu dental clinic, we specialize in early-stage cavity detection and minimally invasive treatment that preserves your natural tooth and protects your long-term oral health.

Whether it’s your first cavity or a recurring issue under an old filling, we use advanced diagnostic tools and aesthetic materials to restore your smile quickly, safely, and painlessly.

🦠 What Is a Cavity?

A cavity (or dental caries) is the result of tooth enamel breakdown caused by acid-producing bacteria. This acid forms when sugars and carbohydrates combine with plaque on the tooth surface. If not addressed, it can eat through the enamel, spread into the dentin, and eventually reach the nerve, causing infection, pain, and tooth loss.

✅ Signs You May Have a Cavity:

Sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweets

A visible hole or dark spot on the tooth

Pain when chewing or biting down

Bad breath or an unpleasant taste

Roughness or food getting stuck in certain areas

Even if you don’t feel pain, cavities can silently progress. That’s why regular checkups at New York Dental are critical for early detection.

🛠️ Our Cavity Treatment Options

At our Daegu dental clinic, we offer a range of filling materials to suit every need—whether it's cosmetic, functional, or budget-conscious:

1. Resin (Tooth-Colored Fillings)

Aesthetic and natural-looking

Requires minimal enamel removal

Ideal for front teeth and visible areas

2. Gold Fillings

Extremely durable—can last 20+ years

Excellent for molars and heavy chewers

Biocompatible and wear-resistant

3. Amalgam (Silver Fillings)

Long-lasting and cost-effective

Fast to apply and ideal for posterior teeth

Not suitable for patients with metal allergies or cosmetic concerns

4. Ceramic / CEREC Fillings

Made of high-strength porcelain

Custom-designed with CAD/CAM technology

Best for patients who want a seamless, stain-resistant restoration

We also provide inlays and onlays for larger cavities where standard fillings may not offer enough structural support.

💡 Why Treat Cavities Early?

✔️ Prevent Root Canal or Extraction

Catching decay early avoids nerve damage and saves your natural tooth.

✔️ Stop Spread to Adjacent Teeth

Cavities can affect neighboring teeth if bacteria aren't removed.

✔️ Restore Function and Appearance

A healthy, smooth tooth surface helps with chewing, speech, and aesthetics.

✔️ Quick and Comfortable

Small cavities can often be treated in less than 30 minutes, with little or no discomfort.

🧾 Cost of Cavity Treatment in Daegu

Cavity treatment pricing depends on location, size, and material used:

Resin Fillings: ₩100,000–₩300,000

Gold Fillings: ₩500,000–₩1,000,000 (subject to gold pricing)

Amalgam Fillings: ₩80,000–₩150,000

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, engaged with installation leaders and Defense Health Agency officials to discuss modernization initiatives and the base’s evolving role within the MHS.

DGMC leaders emphasized the importance of joint training initiatives, which include training medics, nurses and trauma teams alongside civilian partners, recognizing this integrated approach will be essential in future conflicts, while also enhancing vital medical skills for high-quality patient care at home.

They also showcased ongoing efforts to bolster workforce resilience through clinical training, expanded readiness rotations, and robust academic affiliations. These initiatives aim to ensure the medical force remains adaptable and prepared for emerging challenges.

During a town hall at DGMC and throughout his visit, Ferrara expressed his deep appreciation for the staff's commitment, professionalism, and ongoing impact on military medicine. He also emphasized the vital role Travis AFB plays in developing a resilient and ready medical force, capable of responding globally with speed and efficiency.

“I deeply value these visits because they provide an opportunity to see firsthand the incredible work being done and the unique capabilities that drive our mission forward,” Ferrara said. “Most importantly, I want to thank our medical professionals at Travis for their unwavering dedication to caring for patients, pursuing excellence, and training the next generation of medical professionals who will carry this mission into the future.”

The visit reaffirmed the DOD’s focus on ensuring the MHS remains a cornerstone of military readiness, with Travis AFB and DGMC at the forefront for the delivery of world-class medical care and operational support.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9110749/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-18 17:56:18.717191
