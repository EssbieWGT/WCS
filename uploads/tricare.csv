Yea, dental and eye care are separate here in the US. Most insurance companies require you to sign up for each plan, separately, including tricare.

So one, make sure you’re enrolled!

Two, it should be easy to find care if you’re in a military town (town with a large base) as most places will advertise in large lettering TRICARE ACCEPTED on a sign outside their business. Otherwise going to MilConnect can help u find dentists that are in network. Also we just called down to the closest one (we can walk to it) and asked them if they took tricare. He’s been our dentist for years now. Millconnect will use your DEERS login. Calling the tricare west or tricare east line is also helpful as the wait isn’t long but I wouldn’t recommend them to find care. Only to change PCM. I find calling dentists and just asking to be the easiest. I used to work in medical reception and that was our most common call. If we took their insurance. So it’s completely normal and they’ll know the answer. And in the US, all insurance companies work with various practitioners so regardless of your insurance if you want them to cover you have to be seen “in-network” so practices are used to getting asked what insurance that take. It’s also why they advertise! Best wishes!",,N,0.0,2025-05-16 11:56:16.887921

The overall DEFENDER 25 exercise is taking place across the European theater throughout the month of May and early June.

The focus of the medical portion of the exercise is to sustain a ready medical force that is prepared to provide resources forward into a theater of operation, manage the movement of wartime casualties to include military working dogs, manage the movement of blood products to forward areas and execute bed expansion requirements during the simulation of Large-Scale Combat Operations.

“Having a prepared and relevant medical force to deliver combat ready care is critical for success in Large-Scale Combat Operations,” said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Roger Giraud, commander of Medical Readiness Command, Europe and command surgeon for U.S. Army Europe and Africa. “Their ability to rapidly deploy resources forward into the theater is paramount for immediate combat casualty care. Effective casualty management and evacuation ensures timely and appropriate treatment. Maintaining a reliable blood product supply chain to forward areas is vital for hemorrhage control and resuscitation. Furthermore, the capacity to execute rapid bed expansion during surges in casualties is essential to prevent overwhelming medical facilities. A ready and responsive medical force directly impacts survivability and mission success in a complex and demanding operating environment.”

DEFENDER 25 is the Army’s largest annual opportunity to exercise moving personnel and equipment into theater across modes for initial and follow-on operations critical to Large Scale Combat Operations.

Led by U.S. Army Europe and Africa, the exercise focuses on the strategic deployment of CONUS-based forces, employment of Army Prepositioned Stock and follow-on exercises demonstrating lethality and interoperability with Allies and partners.

The exercise is the largest annual U.S. Army deployment into the European Theater consisting of approximately 25,000 U.S Allied and Partner service members, 29 Allied and partner nations, 18 host nations, 14 different aerial ports of embarkation in the U.S., movement of 3,000 pieces of equipment and more than 5,000 U.S. based troops processed into the European Theater.

Also, as part of DEFENDER 25, the 68th Theater Medical Command provided command and control of approximately 500 Soldiers who participated in a field hospital exercise (HOSPEX) during Swift Response 25 at multiple locations in Lithuania during the month of May to train, rehearse, and build operational readiness. This event demonstrated the U.S. Army's ability to rapidly deploy U.S. based combat power in Europe, showcasing the command-and-control synchronization between U.S. and NATO forces.

HOSPEX units included the 519th Field Hospital, with U.S. Role 3, NATO Role 2 Enhanced capabilities, the 30th Medical Brigade, the 173rd Airborne Brigade Support Medical Company with Role 2 capabilities, 7384th Blood Support Detachment, and the 160th Forward Resuscitative Surgical Detachment.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/05/16/8eea356d/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-16 06:56:24.578041
,,2025-05-16 10:02:56+00:00,CNN,Abrupt insurance changes rattle many military families and their medical providers - CNN,Ashley Killough,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/us/tricare-military-health-insurance-problems,"Denise uses Tricare, a military program that provides health insurance for active-duty service members, National Guard members, and many retirees — like Denise.
This resulted in an avalanche of problems for both health care providers and patients, according to 37 providers and patients from 15 states who’ve shared their stories with CNN.
It also authorizes access to civilian networks of providers for those who need care outside of military hospitals or bases.
“It has changed the way that we deal with Tricare patients,” she said.
“Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care.","When Denise learned in February that she might have to pay out of pocket for her weekly therapy sessions, the military veteran from Virginia started to panic.

She’d been seeing her psychologist weekly in Norfolk for over a year and was finally making progress in resolving some buried trauma. Denise, who doesn’t want CNN to use her last name for privacy reasons, calls her therapist her “lifeline,” as she fears taking her own life if she can’t continue the care.

The therapist informed her that Denise’s insurance had stopped paying for her sessions. Denise uses Tricare, a military program that provides health insurance for active-duty service members, National Guard members, and many retirees — like Denise. It services about 9.5 million people.

Her therapist, flustered by the abrupt halt in reimbursements, said she sought to get payment for weeks — not only for Denise’s care but for all her other Tricare patients whose claims were suddenly going unprocessed as of January 1. Without success, she finally had to hold uncomfortable conversations, telling her patients in February that to stay afloat financially, she may need them to pay full price up front — or else pause their care until Tricare could start paying again.

“Panic. Absolute panic,” Denise told CNN, recalling how she felt when she heard the news. Her cost for therapy would increase from her copayment of $50 to roughly $200 per week if she had to pay out of pocket — a cost she couldn’t afford. “It scares me a lot. If I don’t have someone to lean on, it won’t end up well.”

Denise’s therapist, Dr. Libby Cutshall, has continued treating Denise for just the cost of her copayment. But she had to make the painful decision to pause care for about 30 other Tricare patients, as she couldn’t afford to stay in business without receiving reimbursement for their care.

Similar conversations happened in medical offices across the country when Tricare fell behind on reimbursing hordes of medical claims after major changes and technical glitches at the start of the year. This resulted in an avalanche of problems for both health care providers and patients, according to 37 providers and patients from 15 states who’ve shared their stories with CNN. They say those hit hardest were smaller outpatient clinics near military installations that operate on referrals and frequent appointments for mental health, speech therapy, physical therapy, and treatment for autism. For many, it’s caused life-altering financial stress and disruption in care.

Tricare is a complicated system, split between East and West regions, but it’s a mainstay for military families. It’s overseen by the Pentagon’s Defense Health Agency, and, like benefit packages at private companies, it offers various coverage plans for medical, dental, mental health, and prescription drugs. It also authorizes access to civilian networks of providers for those who need care outside of military hospitals or bases.

In the West, a new contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, took over administering the health care program this year with its network of providers, adding to similar work it had done for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the East, Humana Military continued the role it’s had as the region’s contractor for nearly 30 years but changed its claim processing partner. Six states moved from East to West, and the entire network had its annual Medicare rate update.

TriWest said some of the problems were caused by the previous contractor not sending provider information in a timely manner — a claim the previous contractor strongly denies. Humana Military said technical issues made it difficult to process claims, but those issues are now resolved and they’re working to clear the backlog.

Clinics in both regions reported missing reimbursements for months. In the West, many providers said they found themselves out of the network entirely in January and some are still trying to get recredentialed to return. Patients have had issues finding out if the same providers they saw last year are still in-network, or whether their appointments will be covered. Providers and patients alike have spent hours on the phone trying to get answers.

“It’s really halted my whole life,” said Shawn Manvell, the founder of Achievement Center for Therapy and owner of three large clinics — two in California and one in Nevada — that offer a wide range of therapies, with a special focus on treating people with autism. She said more than half of their patients come from Tricare families.

Manvell has received about $70,000 in reimbursement checks recently from TriWest, and another $100,000 in cash advancements that she’ll have to pay back. But she’s still owed an estimated $350,000, she said. To keep treating patients and employing her staff of nearly 30, she’s taken out $500,000 in high-interest loans, along with liquidating some of her own personal assets, she said.

Now five months into the year, progress has been made in both regions, but those who follow Tricare closely say the overall issues and their rippling effects still linger, creating trust issues with Tricare that could leave long-lasting ramifications.

Charlotte Cuestas, a 31-year-old military spouse in Florida, had been seeing a therapist for postpartum depression after a traumatic birth experience. She couldn’t afford the $200 per session out of pocket that her therapist was needing after lack of reimbursement from Humana Military, so Cuestas decided to suspend her sessions. “My fear is that it’s going to get to a point where no therapists are going to want to take Tricare at all because of this issue,” she said.

In several instances, providers near military bases who mostly serve Tricare beneficiaries say they have reduced the number of Tricare patients they’ll accept, have left the network entirely, or plan to close their practice — ultimately resulting in less access to care for active-duty military members, retirees, and their families.

Desperate for help, patients and providers made TikToks or took to military-centric Facebook and Reddit groups to post their experiences. Mission Alpha Advocacy, a non-profit group that focuses on military families with special needs, says it heard from nearly 400 providers who’ve reported insufficient payment and over 500 families who’ve reported disruption in care.

Tricare has gone through turnovers and other hiccups in the past, but this one stands out, said John Letaw, a former Navy lieutenant commander who spends his retirement days helping people navigate the system.

“What we’re seeing this time is way beyond. It’s really inexplicable,” he told CNN in April. Letaw has written a book, “The Ultimate Guide to TRICARE” and runs a Facebook group with nearly 20,000 members, where he’s seen stories of struggle from patients who say they’ve been affected this year.

“It’s pretty catastrophic to a lot of military families,” he said.

‘Domino effect’ leads to possible bankruptcy

Cutshall told CNN she continued treating four other Tricare patients, in addition to Denise, whom she described as her most vulnerable. She said she was too worried about the consequences if they had to suspend their sessions, and she feared they wouldn’t find care elsewhere amid the Tricare struggles.

“(Denise) is at risk for dying if she doesn’t have care. That’s not hyperbole,” Cutshall said of Denise. “She served in the military, and she should get that care — and she shouldn’t have to worry.”

Cutshall said she went nearly three months without receiving any reimbursement at her clinic near Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval installation in the world. With 80% of her patients using the military benefit, her practice was hit hard by the disruption.

By her count, Cutshall said she’s still owed an estimated $30,000 by Tricare. She hasn’t paid herself at all this year, leaning entirely on her partner’s income at home, and she said she’s taken $20,000 from savings to help pay the three other therapists at her practice.

Since early April, with help from a Tricare representative, reimbursements have started trickling in for small amounts of $115 or $120 — a few as large as $600 — but the payments don’t explain which patients they cover, Cutshall said, so she has no way of reconciling her books.

She said she was getting five to 10 calls each day this spring from people seeking care — many of them active-duty military. But she’s had to turn them away, as she seeks to diversify and take clients who have other insurance coverage instead.

“It has changed the way that we deal with Tricare patients,” she said. “And that’s unfortunate because (they make up) so many people in our area, but we cannot continue to do this and sustain and help the people that we want to help.”

The gradual trickling in of reimbursement checks — one provider in Texas said one of her initial checks was for 63 cents — is a sign of progress for many, but it’s hardly relief for those who’ve been hit the hardest.

And for some, the lag in reimbursement has been completely insurmountable. On April 30, Elizabeth Brown-Miller closed her applied behavior analysis clinic for children with autism near Fort Cavazos in Texas. She said the “domino effect” created by a range of payment issues with TriWest this year was too crippling, and she’s now meeting with lawyers about possible bankruptcy and ways to avoid it.

“There’s no hope for us. There’s no way,” she said. “We have to shut down.”

When she opened the clinic in 2021, it was part of the East region with Humana Military. But Texas was one of the six states that migrated to the West this year, and while Brown-Miller’s clinic was still listed as in-network, her 16 therapists were suddenly out-of-network.

Billing became a nightmare, she said, and reimbursement payments weren’t coming through. She had to reduce pay for her therapists and cut back on services for her patients. To further maintain overhead and payroll, Brown-Miller said she took out $182,000 in high-interest loans, expecting the Tricare issues to be resolved soon. TriWest also sent her $70,000 in advance payments to help while they processed the backlog of her claims, she said, but she’ll have to pay that back.

In late April, after crunching the numbers, Brown-Miller decided she couldn’t sustain her business. She was in too much unexpected debt, a hole too deep to climb out.

“A lot of my parents (of patients) are angry. They’re upset. They’re sad. They’re grieving,” she said, growing emotional. “I feel like I failed them. And they tell me I didn’t. But at the end of the day, I did. Because I couldn’t keep my doors open for them.”

She said she reached out to 17 clinics in her area to see who was willing and financially able to take on her Tricare patients. Only four said they could.

Meanwhile, in the East, Natasha Lachapelle has been a speech therapist for 22 years and finally opened her own practice three years ago in the military town of Columbus, Georgia, near Fort Benning Army Base. About 95% of her patients used Tricare.

Six weeks into the new year, she emailed her clients to tell them that due to the lack of income from Tricare – she said she was owed thousands — she was cutting back her hours and taking a part-time position at a hospital instead. “It was an absolute cluster,” said Lachapelle.

As a small, solo practitioner who burned through her savings to deal with a cancer diagnosis last year, Lachapelle said she didn’t have enough money to keep afloat while she saw patients for free.

Humana Military had fully reimbursed her by mid-April, she said, but going months without payment and having to take on another part-time job simply became too much. She emailed her patients again on April 24, this time to say she was shutting down her practice by July, a decision she calls “excruciating.”

She said she feels so burned by Tricare that she can’t risk putting her financial future at stake.

“I can’t trust it,” she said. “I can’t trust it ever again.”

‘We apologize for the inconvenience’

In a message to beneficiaries on March 26, David Smith, the acting director of the Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, acknowledged that the new contractors have “experienced challenges” since January 1 and that beneficiaries and providers “are understandably frustrated” by the delays in payment processing.

Smith wrote that initial technical problems have been addressed and “claims payments are now being processed closer to required standards.”

As of mid-May, Humana Military has adjudicated 6.25 million claims in the East, totaling $1.3 billion, with fewer than 7% of its claims pending beyond 60 days, according to DHA officials and a Humana Military spokesperson. Meanwhile, TriWest has processed and paid more than 7.3 million claims, totaling $1.5 billion, with about 2.6% of its claims outstanding beyond 60 days, according to TriWest.

“We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused,” a Humana Military spokesperson said in a statement. “Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care. We are working closely with impacted providers to ensure they continue to care for TRICARE East Region beneficiaries.”

In the West, a spokesperson from TriWest said in a statement: “All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and while we are currently processing and paying out claims to providers, we recognize that even one provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion is too many.”

TriWest said “it’s making progress every week” and continues to improve processing times. A TriWest spokesperson also said the company hired hundreds of additional customer service staff to handle the massive influx of calls and complaints and reduce the hold time. Both regions said they’re placing a special focus on clinics that treat patients with autism.

With so many providers showing up out-of-network in the West, Tricare and TriWest have sought to assure military families that they don’t need to wait for TriWest approval if they’ve been referred by their primary care manager — usually a physician on base — to see an outpatient provider. Tricare has issued a blanket waiver for patients to reference.

David J. McIntyre, Jr., the president and CEO of TriWest, issued a letter to providers on April 29, apologizing for any disruptions at their practices and reiterated that Tricare patients don’t need approval from TriWest if they’ve been referred for outpatient care at their clinics. McIntyre also addressed the issue of providers being out of network, saying, “Tricare patients may continue to seek care from their existing providers, regardless of whether the provider has joined the TriWest network.”

But patients say they run into providers who don’t trust the waiver. “The problem is medical specialists are reluctant to take those waivers because they’re still not sure that they’ll ever be paid,” said one retired Marine and combat veteran in California, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.

He said he’s lost more sleep trying to resolve questions about his wife’s care than he lost during combat. After getting a partial mastectomy last year to remove a breast lesion, his wife is scheduled for several follow-up appointments with a variety of doctors this year. Her mother died of breast cancer, so it’s a top-of-mind concern for him and his wife. But they can’t get solid assurances that their appointments will be covered.

“The continual non-answers … they start to dominate your thoughts, your feelings. It increases anxiety, puts you on edge,” he said. “It makes you question your own service and sacrifices that you made.”

In Missouri, Danielle Gist was in her first trimester when she learned her obstetrician was no longer in network when TriWest took over. A military spouse who uses Tricare, Gist was suddenly getting large bills that she normally doesn’t get for maternal care.

At an appointment this month, now in her third trimester, she learned her obstetrician was finally back in network. The news “felt like a bit of weight off the shoulders,” she said, but the stress and anxiety of trying to get answers over the past few months still leave her nervous.

“It still feels really uncertain,” she said. “And I still have all the other bills to reconcile, so it’s still looming over me. It just feels overwhelming and exhausting, like a job I didn’t sign up for.”

Christy Collins, a military spouse in Kansas, said Tricare has usually worked well for her family. But this year, she’s spent hours trying to get an appointment scheduled for her 8-year-old daughter to be tested for autism and trying to get ADHD medications renewed for her 12-year-old daughter. She’s also seeking a referral for a breast cancer screening for herself but said she keeps getting the runaround after making multiple phone calls.

“I have a PhD, and I can’t manage to solve this,” she said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8711554.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,-1.0,2025-05-16 08:56:27.679381

Janey Macey, owner of Janey Macey and Associates, provides behavioral therapy to children on the autism spectrum — many of whom are from military families. Her clinic has long relied on payments from TRICARE, the military’s healthcare program. But in the first four months of 2025, she's not received any payments.

""TRICARE has always been a big part of our revenue, and it’s always been easy to work with,” Macey said. “Usually, we submit a claim and within two to three days we’re being paid. But that hasn’t happened this year.”

The issue began after Louisiana was moved from the TRICARE East region to TRICARE West in 2025. TRICARE West is managed by the TriWest Healthcare Alliance, and providers like Macey say the transition has caused major disruptions in payments and customer service.

""I joined a group of TriWest ABA providers on Facebook,” said Macey. “So many of them have had to shut down their doors, lay off staff, or turn TRICARE families away.”

When contacted by KTBS, the TriWest Healthcare Alliance acknowledged the problem in a statement:

“The challenges that Janey Macey is facing are unacceptable, and we are working to address them promptly. We are focusing our processing teams on outstanding ABA claims to help ensure no further payment delays to providers, or disruption of care to beneficiaries. We are also staffing up our dedicated customer service line with additional employees trained to address these challenges. This Autism Care Demonstration Customer Service line can be reached at 833-818-2525. Lastly, we are also reviewing escalations cases daily to help ensure providers experiencing financial distress receive advance payment.

We recognize that any provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion is one too many. We are deeply committed to the providers and military families in Shreveport and Barksdale Air Force Base.

Area(s) of Interest: Cyber Security

What You Need to Know: More than a year after the Change Healthcare cyberattack, physician practices are still facing timely filing denials and financial fallout. Despite state guidance calling for flexibility, some health plans continue to deny claims, and practices are urged to contact CMA for support.

More than a year after the massive cyberattack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit, many physician practices are still grappling with the fallout. Though UnitedHealth Group reported that claims began flowing again in late March 2024, serious disruptions persisted into late 2024, putting significant financial strain on some physician practices.

The major challenge continues to be timely filing denials by health plans, which is threatening the financial viability of some practices. Several practices who utilized Optum as their revenue cycle management (RCM) vendor were especially impacted, reporting that Optum RCM was unable to submit claims until October 2024, which led to large volumes of timely filing denials. While Optum provided temporary loans to help bridge the revenue gap during the outage, some practices are struggling to repay those loans without having received the revenue those claims should have generated.

The California Medical Association (CMA) worked with the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) to ensure physician practices would still be able to be paid for services, even if claims didn’t meet the timely filing requirements under law or contract. As a result, DMHC issued All Plan Letter 24-005, laying out flexibilities it expected plans to offer to ensure delivery system stability following the cyberattack, one of which was a removal or relaxation of timely filing limits. The DMHC guidance also advised that plans should not require providers to appeal under the “good cause” exception under law, as doing so would further delay claims processing and reimbursement to practices.

Despite this guidance from DMHC, CMA and the American Medical Association are both receiving reports of practices impacted by the cyberattack receiving timely filing denials.

If your practice has been affected, CMA is committed to supporting practices.

Practices still experiencing timely filing denials or struggling to repay temporary loans due to unpaid claims from the cyberattack are encouraged to contact CMA’s Center for Economic Services at (800) 786-4262 or economicservices@cmadocs.org.

(“Zynex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Timothy Jenkins, flight chief of diagnostics and therapeutics for the 319th MDG.","GRAND FORKS AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. — The integration of the 28th Medical Group personnel to the 319th Medical Group has been an integral part of supporting the ongoing beddown of 17 B-1B Lancers from Ellsworth AFB, S.D., to Grand Forks AFB. With the influx of approximately 800 additional airmen to support B-1 operations, the 319th MDG required a plus-up of manpower to ensure top quality medical care for assigned airmen, their families and local TRICARE beneficiaries.

Ellsworth AFB is undergoing a $129.5 million runway repair as a major step in preparing to receive the U.S. Air Force’s newest global strike platform, the B-21 Raider. The projected 11-month temporary beddown at Grand Forks AFB allows the 28th BW to deliver decisive bomber airpower wherever ordered by the commander-in-chief.

“With the support of Grand Forks AFB, our aviators can continue the B1-B Lancer mission and maintain long-range strike capabilities at all times,” said Staff Sgt. Brianna Middel, independent duty medical technician for the 28th MDG. “The teamwork and collaboration between the innovators and problem solvers from both bases has allowed the transition to go very smoothly from a medical standpoint.”

Middel noted the two teams worked closely together to maximize the space, equipment and resources in the 319th MDG to fit the need of the increase in daily patient care. “To accommodate the medical readiness needs of the 28th MDG, the 319th MDG has adjusted clinical space to ensure 28th MDG has office space, patient care rooms, and necessary equipment,” said Middel. “The close daily collaboration between the two medical groups has optimized care and allowed for issues to be identified and addressed without delay.”

Through collaboration, the 28th MDG is postured to provide a range of treatments and services for their personnel that include walk-in services, treatment of minor medical concerns, mental health treatment, occupational health exams and aeromedical dispositions of members on flying status. “Whenever there’s been problems or questions about differences in procedures, we’ve been able to come together and collaborate on the solution in a positive way to achieve the best outcomes for our patients,” said Tech. Sgt. Timothy Jenkins, flight chief of diagnostics and therapeutics for the 319th MDG.

While the B-1 beddown continues, so do the 24/7 missions of the 319th RW to operate the high altitude, long endurance Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft the RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 40; the High Frequency Global Communications System and deliver operations support to their mission partners that include Customs and Border Protection, the Test and Resource Management Center and the Space Development Agency.

Sustaining consistent mission output, supporting an influx of over a dozen aircraft and hundreds of airmen and executing the first RQ-4 operations directly tasked by the U.S. Secretary of Defense in three years requires healthy, mission ready airmen and dependable, trusted medical care.

“The mission won’t sustain itself, it’s the people who sustain the mission,” said Lt. Col. Bryan Payne, commander for the 319th Operational Medical Readiness Squadron. “We could not be more appreciative to the 28th MDG for making this sacrifice and putting the mission first to allow our airmen to receive the care they need.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/28thMedicalGroup.png,N,0.0,2025-05-15 17:56:27.273125

Donham is currently the commander of the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity-Alaska.
“Every single success in military medicine is a shared achievement,” Brown said.","Champions in military medicine were honored during the annual Henry Jackson Foundation’s Heroes of Military Medicine awards ceremony held on May 8, 2025, at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.

The awards recognized outstanding contributions by senior leaders, medical professionals, and civilians who distinguished themselves through excellence and dedication to advancing military medicine and enhancing the lives and health of our nation’s wounded, ill, and injured service members, veterans, their families, and civilians, according to the foundation.

“The Military Health System is no doubt recognized as a world-class medical force, “ said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in his opening remarks. “Medical readiness is combat readiness. This is not just a slogan—it is a reality. A force that is not medically ready is a force that is not mission ready. Taking care of our warfighters will always be our number one priority.”

Medical professionals from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Public Health Service received awards, as well as an ambassador and a civilian provider. “There are many heroes in the Military Health System that take care of patients daily all over the world, support the readiness of the force, spend hours in research in many aspects of our systems too numerous to mention, and we have the opportunity to recognize the best of the best,” said Ferrara.

U.S. Army Honoree: U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Benjamin Donham. Donham is currently the commander of the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity-Alaska. Before his current assignment, he served at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas; and at Fort Bragg, N.C., as commander of the 261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion and command surgeon for XVIII Airborne Corps.

Donham recognized his family for their dedication and sacrifice for his military career. “I get to do what I love because of their sacrifice, their patience, and their unwavering support. I share this recognition,” said Donham. “To the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines I've served with, your shared sense of mission and purpose continues to make the journey work.”

U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, said Col. Donham has served as a battlefield surgeon, a combat veteran, a special forces operator, scholar, commander, and pioneer in military medical innovation. “His contributions go so far beyond his operational excellence,” she said.

U.S. Navy Honoree: U.S. Navy Capt. (Dr.) Matthew Tadlock. As a trauma and general surgeon with 23 years of active duty experience, Tadlock currently serves as the officer in charge, Surface Medical Group-Pacific, where he prepares fleet surgical teams for deployment on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships. Since 2021, he’s led the Maritime Surgery Quality Improvement program, an initiative focused on tracking, improving, and standardizing all surgical care performed on U.S. combatant vessels. He is also an attending surgeon at Naval Medical Center San Diego and an associate professor of surgery through the Uniformed Services University.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Walter Brafford, commander, Naval Medical Forces Development Command, commended Tadlock, saying, “Under immense threat and pressure, often far from traditional medical facilities, Capt. Tadlock has relied not just on his own exceptional skills as a trauma and critical care specialist, but through his visionary leadership in shaping the very landscape of how we prepare and sustain our operational medical teams.”

“He doesn’t just maintain the status quo; he forges a new path.”

Tadlock thanked his family and fellow military medical professionals, saying, “Many of the accomplishments that led to this recognition, myself, or others, started at the grassroots level. To be recognized for being a part of these grassroots efforts and to see some of them become how we do business is incredibly rewarding.”

U.S. Air Force Honoree: U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Daniel Brown. “Every single success in military medicine is a shared achievement,” Brown said. “Especially true in the care and transport of those injured, a mission that has helped shape my career.”

Brown is an emergency services master clinician at Wright-Patterson Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he serves as the senior advisor to a 90-person emergency services flight and directs clinical operations for 13,000 emergency patients per year.

U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Jason Lennen, director of policy and resources at the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Air Force, told the audience, “Col. Brown's profound impact will be forever felt by the patients and staff he has directly touched, as well as the county centers that were built with the firm foundation that he has led to treat, heal and save, to enable our Air Force to fly, fight and win, and our joint force to deter, defend and defeat.”

U.S. Public Health Service Honoree: USPHS Capt. (Dr.) John Iskander. Iskander, currently assigned to the Food and Drug Administration, most recently served as chief of the immunization healthcare division for the Defense Health Agency and previously was chief of preventive medicine and population health for the U.S. Coast Guard.

U.S. Public Health Service Rear Adm. Denise Hinton, deputy U.S. Surgeon General, said Iskander, “is a distinguished leader whose contributions have profoundly advanced military and veteran medicine.” “His career has been defined by excellence in clinical care, his groundbreaking medical research, and an unwavering dedication to those who serve as a physician leader within the United States Public Health Service Commission Corps.”

Iskander thanked those in attendance for the recognition for his service to the USPHS and emphasized the importance of the work of the agency, saying, “It is my privilege to accept this award with thanks to all my fellow United States Public Health Service officers who have and continue to serve our warfighters and veterans.”

Civilian Provider Honoree: Dr. Troy Akers. Akers is the civilian chief of emergency medicine at Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center, a position he transitioned into following his military retirement in 2018.

Dr. David Smith, acting director, Defense Health Agency, introduced Akers and talked about his heroic efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in 2024 that ravaged many communities in Georgia, including the area that relies on the Eisenhower Army Medical Center for medical care. In the immediate hours of the destruction resulting from the storm, Smith said Akers went to the center and quickly began to respond to the needs of the community, patients, and his staff. “This is what leadership is in crisis,” said Smith. “These are the actions of an individual who captures all the qualities we seek in our line of work: calmness, confidence, and compassion for those they serve.”

Akers said his job is “to make sure that the men and women that wear that uniform—the most precious resources this country has—have everything they need to make sure that they can fight America's wars, taking care of their family members when they're deployed, making sure they're medically ready, has been the honor of my life, and I thank every single day I get to do this job.”

Ambassador Honoree: Sal Gonzalez. Gonzalez enlisted in the Marines in 2004 and was assigned to the 2nd Battalion. While serving in Iraq, his vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a below-the-knee amputation. While recovering from his injuries, he was introduced to many programs that offer rehabilitation and recovery of injured service members, including music. Since, he has performed at the Grand Ole’ Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and is about to release his first full-length album.

He “turned his healing journey into a mission, proving that music can give bridge to recovery, resilience, and renew purpose,” said Joseph Caravalho, president and CEO of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.

Gonzalez told the audience, “The only reason I am alive today is because of people like those who are being honored tonight. Because if I had been injured as grievously as I was injured in Iraq, just a couple of decades before—I do not think I would have survived.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9035512.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-15 16:56:22.593381

Mellinger pleaded guilty to wire fraud and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, impacting TRICARE and the IRS.

The scheme involved disguising illegal profits as royalties and leveraging client investigations for personal gain.

The broader Mississippi pain cream fraud case involved over $1.5 billion in fraudulent claims across multiple states.

A Florida man who pleaded guilty in Mississippi to orchestrating a scheme to promote an illegal tax shelter and commit wire fraud was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $40 million in restitution.

Stephen Mellinger in 2017 was named as a person connected to what would become known as the Mississippi pain cream scheme that netted more than 20 arrests and unveiled approximately $515 million in health-care fraud in Mississippi alone.

Mellinger also pleaded guilty to assisting in the preparation of false tax returns for tax shelter clients. He must repay over $35.6 million to the IRS and $2.1 million to TRICARE.

Mellinger pleaded guilty to the charges in February at the William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse in Hattiesburg. He was sentenced Wednesday, May 14.

In late January 2016, several pharmacies and businesses throughout Mississippi were raided by law enforcement, leaving people wondering what was going on.

It took time for the case to unfold, but the fraud, which had its beginnings in Hattiesburg, had tentacles across the country, from California to Connecticut and many states in between, totaling over $1.5 billion in fraud.

TRICARE was the main target of the pain cream fraud, involving high-priced compounded pain creams, scar creams, weight-loss remedies and vitamins. Compounded formulas are meant to be tailored to individual patients, but in this case, were formulated to maximize profit.

Mellinger's fraudulent tax shelters also took time to unfold — nearly a decade, according to court documents.

Mellinger, according to court records, was helping some of the perpetrators of the pain cream fraud avoid paying income tax on illegally obtained profits by claiming them as royalties paid for using intellectual property rather than reporting the money as revenue.

He had other clients for which he orchestrated investments in similar tax shelters, but when he learned his clients involved in the pain cream scheme were under investigation by the federal government and a civil forfeiture issued, he began using that as leverage to get even more money from those clients.

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Hi Justine,

The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence, otherwise known as EACE, leads the advancement of extremity trauma-related research and clinical practice in the Military Health System—aiming to ensure a better future for those with extremity trauma. The center is run by the Defense Health Agency.

For answers, we turned to Andrea Crunkhorn, who applies her doctorate in physical therapy and status as the chief of clinical programs for EACE to support our injured warfighters and the clinicians who care for them. She had this to say.

--

EACE serves as the Defense Health Agency’s center of excellence for limb trauma and limb loss. We focus on the best-supported scientific and medical data and health care for service members and other Department of Defense community members with these injuries. We foster clinical practice and provide support tools to clinicians, patients, families, and caregivers. We help the clinicians who work with these patients be as efficient and effective as possible.

EACE assists our providers as they rehabilitate our wounded warriors and create a new normal for all patients with extremity trauma and amputation. Our specialists and staff work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create internationally recognized clinical practice guidelines, so all limb rehabilitation follows the same best evidence.

The DOD and VA published the current upper limb amputation clinical practice guideline in 2022. These documents are regularly reviewed and updated to add new treatments and programs that improve patient care. DOD-VA published our revised clinical practice guideline for lower limb amputation rehabilitation in January 2025.

EACE offers every patient like your husband a guide called “Within Reach: The Journey After Upper Limb Amputation.” The guide provides information on coping skills, pain management, caring for your remaining limb, physical rehabilitation, and artificial limbs. The guide is available digitally on the EACE website under clinical affairs.

For soon-to-be parents, parents, families, and caregivers, we have a helpful handout, “Pregnancy, Childcare and Parenting after Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation.” It includes tips such as how to manage child care tasks.

The DOD Amputation Prosthetics Clearinghouse is a new portal for advice, discussion, and referral to one of the three Advanced Rehabilitation Centers in the DHA. The three ARCs are located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where I work; Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas; and Naval Medical Center San Diego, in San Diego, California.

These programs lead to advances in treating and restoring function after limb trauma and amputation. The centers are the only military hospitals that fabricate and modify artificial limbs. They also provide high-quality care from before surgery until you can return to your community.

You and your military hospital or clinic providers can reach out to me and my staff with questions at either of these emails: dha.ncr.Medical-Affairs.mbx.amputation-prosth-coe@health.mil. Additionally, phone numbers for contacts at each ARC are available on the fact sheets.

Other resources include the VA’s Amputation System of Care or its Polytrauma/TBI System of Care.

EACE also has information on surgeries such as directly attaching an artificial limb to the patient’s bone. This surgery can help patients who have difficulty tolerating a socket.

EACE focuses on research that can save injured limbs, avoid amputations, and preserve and restore injured limb function. We work to make our patients return to the highest possible level of physical, mental, and emotional function. Our warfighters deserve no less. We truly appreciate all that you do.

About the webinar

Medicaid has played a vital role in providing health coverage for individuals and families with low incomes and special care needs. For military-connected families, Medicaid can serve as a valuable complement to TRICARE, particularly for those caring for family members with special healthcare needs.

Additionally, Medicare may become a critical source of coverage for individuals transitioning out of military service due to separation or retirement.

The webinar will be led by Christopher Plein, Ph.D., Eberly Family Professor for Outstanding Public Service Emeritus at West Virginia University.

Learning objectives

Identify how Medicaid supports military-connected families, including those on active duty, in the National Guard and Reserve and those who are retired or separated from service.

Describe the interaction between Medicaid and TRICARE in providing healthcare coverage.

Explore the role of Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waivers in supporting dependents with special care needs.

Review current policy developments and proposed changes in Medicaid that may impact military-connected families.

The company also provided updates on its business and clinical programs.

Financial Highlights

For the first quarter of 2025, BiomX reported a net loss of $7.7 million, a significant improvement from the $17.3 million net loss in the same period of 2024. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributed to changes in the fair value of warrants issued in previous financings. Research and development expenses increased to $5.3 million from $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, driven by preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of BX004 and increased expenses related to the Phase 2 trial of BX211. General and administrative expenses slightly decreased to $2.5 million from $2.7 million in the same period last year.

Business and Operational Highlights

BiomX announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 trial evaluating BX211 for the treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). The trial demonstrated that BX211 was safe, well-tolerated, and produced statistically significant improvements in ulcer size and depth compared to placebo. Additionally, the company is on track to report topline results for its BX004 Phase 2b study in cystic fibrosis (CF) in the first quarter of 2026.

Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments

In April 2025, BiomX shareholders approved the exercise of warrants issued in the $12 million financings announced in February 2025. These funds are expected to support the company's activities through the anticipated Phase 2b results for the BX004 trial. The company also highlighted the significant non-dilutive funding of approximately $40 million from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA) for the BX211 program.

Management's Perspective

Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX, expressed satisfaction with the company's progress, particularly the positive Phase 2 results from the BX211 program. He emphasized the importance of these results in reinforcing the potential of phage therapy to address serious, resistant infections. Solomon also highlighted the company's focus on the upcoming Phase 2b readout of BX004 in cystic fibrosis, supported by recent financings.

Future Outlook

BiomX anticipates reporting topline results for the BX004 Phase 2b study in cystic fibrosis in the first quarter of 2026.

Business Update

On April 21, 2025, a BiomX Special Meeting of stockholders took place during which shareholders approved the exercise of certain warrants issued as part of the Company’s $12 million financings announced in February 2025. The completed financings will provide runway expected to support the Company’s activities into the first quarter of 2026, when the Company anticipates the readout of topline Phase 2b results for BX004 for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa.

First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Cash balance and restricted cash as of March 31, 2025, were $21.2 million, compared to $18.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to funds raised in the February 2025 financings, partly offset by net cash used in operating activities. BiomX estimates its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Research and development expenses, net were $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of the Company’s CF product candidate, BX004; an increase in expenses relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s DFO product candidate, BX211; and an increase in rent and related expenses following the March 2024 acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). This increase was partly offset by higher grants BiomX received.

General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to expenses incurred during 2024 in connection with the acquisition of APT completed in March 2024, partially offset by increased salaries and share-based compensation expenses.

Net loss was $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $17.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is mainly due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Company’s financing completed in March 2024.

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $8.7 million, compared to $11.4 million for the same period in 2024.

About BX211

BX211 is a phage treatment for the treatment of DFO associated with S. aureus. DFO is a bacterial infection of the bone that usually develops from an infected foot ulcer and is a leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes. In March 2025, BiomX announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 trial in which BX211 was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated and patients receiving BX211 exhibited statistically significant1 and sustained reduction of ulcer size (PAR)(p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10. In addition, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline, ulcer depth was classified according to deepest tissue involved as measured by swab) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017). Over the 12-week treatment period, all patients (treatment and placebo) were treated in accordance with standard of care, including with systemic antibiotic therapy as appropriate. BiomX is currently planning a Phase 2/3 trial, pending discussions and feedback from the FDA.

About BX004

BiomX is developing BX004, a fixed multi-phage cocktail, for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa, a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. In November 2023, BiomX announced positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial where BX004 demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function associated with a reduction in P. aeruginosa burden compared to placebo in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced lung function (baseline FEV1<70%). BiomX expects to initiate a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b trial in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004 or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The trial is designed to monitor the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. Pending progress of the trial, topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The FDA has granted BX004 Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation.

NESS ZIONA, Israel, May 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BiomX Inc. (NYSE American: PHGE) (“BiomX” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage company advancing novel natural and engineered phage therapies that target specific pathogenic bacteria, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, and provided program and business updates.

“The first quarter of 2025 was a period of exceptional progress for BiomX, both on the corporate front and across our clinical pipeline,” said Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX. “The strength of the positive Phase 2 results from our BX211 program in diabetic foot osteomyelitis exceeded our expectations and received resounding endorsement from key opinion leaders and industry experts. These positive results represent a significant milestone for the field of bacteriophage therapy and further reinforce our platform’s potential to address serious, resistant infections. Notably, the BX211 program has been supported to date by approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA), which has identified an urgent need for new treatments to combat antibiotic-resistant infections in current and future conflict environments. The work received DHA and Department of Navy funding under an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award through the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) and managed by the Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC) – Naval Advanced Medical Development (NAMD). We are currently in discussions regarding potential next steps in partnership with the DHA to further advance this program. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our next major catalyst, which is the anticipated Phase 2b readout of BX004 in cystic fibrosis in the first quarter of next year, supported by the recent financings we secured to advance this program and extend our operational runway.”

Clinical Program Updates

BX211 – phage for the treatment of DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)

In March 2025, BiomX announced positive results from the Company’s DFO Adaptive Novel Care Evaluation (DANCE™) Phase 2 trial evaluating its BX211 phage treatment for DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).

Key highlights from the Phase 2 trial results included:

BX211 was found to be safe and well-tolerated.

BX211 produced sustained and statistically significant1 Percentage Area Reduction (PAR) of ulcer size (p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo (standard of care) starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10.

Compared to placebo, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017), compared to placebo.

BX211 demonstrated favorable trends compared to placebo across several additional clinical parameters, including: proportion of visits with no clinical evidence of infection; evidence of resolving DFO by MRI/X-ray at week 12; proportion of patients with abnormal C-Reactive Protein at baseline that achieved a reduction of CRP of at least 50% at any point in the study; and greater Wagner scale improvement2.

Through week 13, BX211 demonstrated comparable efficacy against both Methicillin-susceptible and resistant strains, as well as against high and low biofilm producers—consistent with the orthogonal mechanism of phage therapy to antibiotics and its inherent anti-biofilm capabilities.

A key opinion leader (KOL) event discussing the Phase 2 results took place on April 3, 2025. A replay of the webcast is available here, the content of which does not form a part of this press release.

Pending feedback from the FDA, BiomX is planning for a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of BX211.

The completed financings will provide runway expected to support the Company’s activities into the first quarter of 2026, when the Company anticipates the readout of topline Phase 2b results for BX004 for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa.

First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Cash balance and restricted cash as of March 31, 2025, were $21.2 million, compared to $18.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to funds raised in the February 2025 financings, partly offset by net cash used in operating activities. BiomX estimates its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Research and development expenses, net were $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of the Company’s CF product candidate, BX004; an increase in expenses relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s DFO product candidate, BX211; and an increase in rent and related expenses following the March 2024 acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). This increase was partly offset by higher grants BiomX received.

General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to expenses incurred during 2024 in connection with the acquisition of APT completed in March 2024, partially offset by increased salaries and share-based compensation expenses.

Net loss was $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $17.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is mainly due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Company’s financing completed in March 2024.

In March 2025, BiomX announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 trial in which BX211 was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated and patients receiving BX211 exhibited statistically significant1 and sustained reduction of ulcer size (PAR)(p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10. In addition, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline, ulcer depth was classified according to deepest tissue involved as measured by swab) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017). Over the 12-week treatment period, all patients (treatment and placebo) were treated in accordance with standard of care, including with systemic antibiotic therapy as appropriate. BiomX is currently planning a Phase 2/3 trial, pending discussions and feedback from the FDA.

About BX004

BiomX is developing BX004, a fixed multi-phage cocktail, for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa, a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. In November 2023, BiomX announced positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial where BX004 demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function associated with a reduction in P. aeruginosa burden compared to placebo in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced lung function (baseline FEV1<70%). BiomX expects to initiate a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b trial in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004 or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The trial is designed to monitor the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. Pending progress of the trial, topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The FDA has granted BX004 Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation.

Safe Harbor

This press release contains express or implied “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “target,” “believe,” “expect,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “would,” “positioned,” “future,” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. For example, when BiomX refers its anticipated timing for reporting results for its clinical assets as well as the design thereof, expected discussions with the FDA and other regulatory authorities and the DHA and results thereof, the potential of its candidates to address the substantial unmet needs of patients with intractable infections, and the estimates of the sufficiency of its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, it is using forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on BiomX management’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of BiomX’s control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that BiomX may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors, including risks inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, such as: adverse results in BiomX’s drug discovery, preclinical and clinical development activities, the risk that the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, BiomX’s ability to enroll patients in its clinical trials, and the risk that any of its clinical trials may not commence, continue or be completed on time, or at all; decisions made by the FDA, DHA and other regulatory authorities; decisions made by investigational review boards at clinical trial sites and publication review bodies with respect to our development candidates; BiomX’s ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights for its platform and development candidates; its potential dependence on collaboration partners; competition; uncertainties as to the sufficiency of BiomX’s cash resources to fund its planned activities for the periods anticipated and BiomX’s ability to manage unplanned cash requirements; and general economic and market conditions. Therefore, investors should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements and should review the risks and uncertainties described under the caption “Risk Factors” in BiomX’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 25, 2025, and additional disclosures BiomX makes in its other filings with the SEC, which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

,,2025-05-15 03:05:33+00:00,Arnold & Porter,A Lost Cause: Jury Finds CVS Caused the Submission of False Claims by Subsidiary Omnicare,"Paula Ramer, Laura Turner",,,,,https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/fca-qui-notes/posts/2025/05/a-lost-cause,"On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions.
In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare’s parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.
The government further alleged that CVS “caused” the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices but failed to correct them.
After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS “caused” the false claims to be submitted.
Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS.","On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions. A unanimous jury concluded that Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy in the United States, fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, a government military healthcare program, for more than three million false claims totaling more than $135 million in damages — one of the largest jury verdicts ever in an FCA case. If trebled, damages could reach more than $400 million, plus penalties. In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare’s parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.

The relator, an Omnicare pharmacist, filed suit in 2015, and in 2019 the federal government, 29 states, and the District of Columbia intervened. The four-week jury trial began on April 1, 2025. The government alleged that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in assisted living and other long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and then submitted claims for reimbursement for those prescriptions to the federal healthcare programs. The government further alleged that CVS “caused” the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices but failed to correct them. CVS focused its defense heavily on a materiality argument, arguing that the practice at issue was allowed by law in many states and accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS “caused” the false claims to be submitted. Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS. Specifically, she found the evidence showed that CVS “had ultimate oversight over Omnicare’s compliance with Government program regulations — indeed, was required to do so by virtue of the [Corporate Integrity Agreement]” that CVS had entered into in 2016 related to different conduct by Omnicare; and “that [CVS] was aware of the compliance issues that underlie this case, and the fact that certain fixes had been proposed to remedy them” but “opted not to force [Omnicare] to adopt those fixes.”

The parties will submit briefing over the next month addressing the penalties to be assessed under the FCA, and CVS has said that it plans to appeal the decision. We at Qui Notes will continue to keep you updated on developments in the case.

In response to the Governor’s May Revision to the 2025-26 state budget, California Medical Association (CMA) President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D., issued the following the statement:

""The Newsom administration’s decision to divert voter-approved Proposition 35 and Proposition 56 funds is a direct violation of the will of California voters.

""Instead of honoring the clear intent of Prop 35 and voters – to increase access to care for Medi-Cal patients through a protected funding stream – the Governor is proposing to use this money to patch a budget shortfall of the state’s own making. At the same time, the Governor is repurposing Prop 56 dollars (passed in 2016) that provide critical funding to family planning and reproductive health care services and dental care.

""During the first quarter of 2025, we completed our third Phase 2 study, specifically our Phase 1b/2a diSArm study of intravenous AP-SA02 as a potential treatment for complicated S. aureus bacteremia,"" stated Dr. Deborah Birx, Chief Executive Officer of Armata. ""Topline data is anticipated in the second quarter of 2025 to support a potential future pivotal efficacy trial. We recently announced additional award funding from the DoD through MTEC, which will be used to continue the support for the AP-SA02 product candidate and activities required for the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to align on an efficient path toward Phase 3 and registration.""

""We continue to stay true to our mission of evaluating phage-based therapeutics in rigorously designed, randomized controlled clinical trials that can support potential regulatory approval, and I am very pleased with our progress to date,"" Dr. Birx concluded.

First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Grant and Award Revenue. The Company recognized grant and award revenue of $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $1.0 million in the comparable period in 2024. This represents MTEC's share of the costs incurred for the Company's AP-SA02 program for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia.

Research and Development. Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were approximately $5.4 million, compared to approximately $8.0 million for the comparable period in 2024. The Company continues to invest in clinical-related expenses associated with its primary development programs.

General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were approximately $3.3 million, compared to approximately $3.2 million for the comparable period in 2024. The increase of $0.1 million is primarily related to an increase of $0.5 million in personnel expenses and an increase of $0.1 million in lease expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in consulting fees.

Loss from Operations. Loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was approximately $8.2 million, compared to a loss from operations of approximately $10.2 million for the comparable period in 2024.

Net Loss. The net loss for the first quarter of 2025 was $6.5 million, or $0.18 loss per share on a basic and $0.20 loss per share on a diluted basis, as compared to a net loss of $25.0 million, or $0.69 loss per share on both a basic and diluted basis, for the comparable period in 2024. The net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 included a non-cash gain from changes in fair value of the Company's convertible loan of $5.2 million, compared to a $13.0 million non-cash loss from changes in fair value of the Company's convertible loan for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. As of March 31, 2025, Armata held approximately $11.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, compared to $9.3 million as of December 31, 2024.

Interested patients will be able to enroll in the new Tricare Prime option during open season, which runs from early November through early December.
After receiving the Tricare Prime program contract last November, the company's chief executive officer said the new programs are intended to increase access to care for Tricare Prime beneficiaries and provide personalized support.
Families of active-duty personnel who use Tricare Prime pay no annual enrollment fees, cost-shares or copayments.
Tricare Prime is not available to retirees and family members ages 65 and older who use Tricare For Life and Medicare.","Active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members who live in Atlanta or Tampa, Florida, will have a new option for health care next year: Tricare Prime managed by CareSource Military and Veterans.

The nonprofit organization was awarded a contract in 2024 to run a three-year demonstration project to provide Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed care-style health program, to more than 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in the two cities, beginning in 2026.

The new agreement, which will run through 2029, gives another health care option for military beneficiaries and allows the Defense Health Agency to evaluate having other health care entities manage portions of the Tricare patient load alongside Humana Government Business, which holds the Tricare East Region contract.

""Tricare Prime Atlanta and Tricare Prime Tampa represent an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,"" Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the DHA, said in a statement May 7. ""The data we get from this demonstration will inform future Tricare innovations nationwide.""

Atlanta previously served as a test bed for a three-year Tricare Prime pilot run by Humana and Kaiser Permanente, the nonprofit considered to be a pioneer in health maintenance organization programs.

That program, which ended in 2022, sought to determine whether the DHA could provide ""value-based care"" -- a health system that pays providers based on performance, quality and value as opposed to volume.

Atlanta was home to the Army's Fort McPherson until 2011 when it was closed as part of the Pentagon's 2005 Base Realignment and Closure effort. When it closed, nearly 30,000 military retirees and their families lived in the area, and Georgia has become an increasingly popular retirement state for military personnel.

Tampa is the home of U.S. Central Command and MacDill Air Force Base, with roughly 34,000 military dependents and 133,000 retirees, according to Defense Department data.

Interested patients will be able to enroll in the new Tricare Prime option during open season, which runs from early November through early December. During open season, beneficiaries can switch between Tricare programs such as Prime or Select or unique plans offered in various locations.

CareSource is a managed-care and health insurance organization that provides programs and services to 2 million people. After receiving the Tricare Prime program contract last November, the company's chief executive officer said the new programs are intended to increase access to care for Tricare Prime beneficiaries and provide personalized support.

""We are honored to be entrusted with this vital responsibility,"" CareSource CEO Erhardt Preitauer said in a statement. ""Our team is dedicated to delivering a health plan that will provide military families with access to high-quality care that is uniquely tailored to their needs.""

Families of active-duty personnel who use Tricare Prime pay no annual enrollment fees, cost-shares or copayments. Retirees and their family members on Tricare Prime pay an annual enrollment fee, which, for most retirees, was $372 for an individual and $744 for a family in 2025.

Those beneficiaries also pay a $25 copay for a primary care visit, $38 per specialty care or urgent care visit, and $77 for an emergency room visit.

Defense Department spokesman Peter Graves said that the new programs are in addition to the Tricare health care programs already available in both cities, including existing military treatment facilities as well as Tricare Prime and Select managed by Humana.

Tricare Prime is not available to retirees and family members ages 65 and older who use Tricare For Life and Medicare.

Regular dental care for children supports not only their oral health, but their overall well-being.","MAY 14, 2025 – Did you know that oral health has important links to your overall health? That’s why it’s especially important that children get proper dental care from an early age. This helps them maintain healthy teeth and gums throughout their lives.

Luckily, the TRICARE Dental Program, administered by United Concordia, has you covered. The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.

“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch. “It ensures your child has access to high-quality dental care that helps establish healthy habits early.”

Automatic enrollment at age 1

The TDP automatically enrolls your child in your dental plan when they turn age 1, if there’s a family member currently enrolled. This enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following your child’s birthday.

It’s important to be proactive with your child’s oral health in the early stages. Bring your child to their first dental appointment after their first tooth appears, but no later than their first birthday. Most babies’ teeth start to grow in at around 4 to 6 months old.

If you had a single plan before your child turned 1, your premium will change from the single plan rate to the family plan rate when your child is enrolled.

Costs

Your TDP monthly premiums are based on your sponsor’s status, rank and your enrollment type. Enrollment types include:

Sponsor only

Single enrollment (one family member, not sponsor)

Family enrollment (more than one family member, not sponsor)

Sponsor and family

Your cost-shares depend on your sponsor’s pay grade and where you live.

Coverage duration

Children can keep their TDP coverage until the end of the month they turn 23 if they:

Are unmarried

Attend an approved institution of higher education full-time

Get at least half their financial support from their military sponsor

If your child stops meeting any of these conditions before turning 23, their coverage ends at the end of the month the change occurs. Additionally, if your child doesn’t meet these conditions at age 21, they’ll lose TRICARE coverage.

Services covered by TDP

The TDP covers a wide range of dental services for children, as described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook:

Regular checkups and cleanings

X-rays and evaluations

Fluoride treatments

Sealants for cavity prevention

Fillings and restorations

Orthodontics (braces) when medically necessary

Emergency dental care

Most children can receive two routine teeth cleanings and two topical fluoride applications every 12 months. Your dentist can recommend the right schedule for your child’s needs.

Service frequency

The TDP provides coverage based on the following timeframes:

Every 12 months:

Two oral checkups

One set of bitewing X-rays

Two routine cleanings

Two fluoride applications

Every 36 months:

One full mouth X-ray

Sealants on permanent molars through age 18

Finding a dentist

To find a CONUS dentist, search the United Concordia network. If you’re overseas, use the OCONUS Find a Dentist tool.

Using military dental clinics

In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics. But in certain situations, they may. These situations include:

Emergencies

Certain special dental cases in children

Dental work related to treatment received at a military hospital or clinic

Your family members may be able to use overseas military dental clinics if they have space available. Check with your local overseas military dental clinic to find out what services they offer.

U.S. Public Health Service Rear Adm. Denise Hinton, deputy U.S.","Champions in military medicine were honored during the annual Henry Jackson Foundation’s Heroes of Military Medicine awards ceremony held on May 8, 2025, at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.

The awards recognized outstanding contributions by senior leaders, medical professionals, and civilians who distinguished themselves through excellence and dedication to advancing military medicine and enhancing the lives and health of our nation’s wounded, ill, and injured service members, veterans, their families, and civilians, according to the foundation.

“The Military Health System is no doubt recognized as a world-class medical force, “ said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in his opening remarks. “Medical readiness is combat readiness. This is not just a slogan—it is a reality. A force that is not medically ready is a force that is not mission ready. Taking care of our warfighters will always be our number one priority.”

Medical professionals from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Public Health Service received awards, as well as an ambassador and a civilian provider.

“There are many heroes in the Military Health System that take care of patients daily all over the world, support the readiness of the force, spend hours in research in many aspects of our systems too numerous to mention, and we have the opportunity to recognize the best of the best,” said Ferrara.

U.S. Army Honoree: U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Benjamin Donham

Donham is currently the commander of the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity-Alaska. Before his current assignment, he served at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas; and at Fort Bragg, N.C., as commander of the 261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion and command surgeon for XVIII Airborne Corps.

Donham recognized his family for their dedication and sacrifice for his military career. “I get to do what I love because of their sacrifice, their patience, and their unwavering support. I share this recognition,” said Donham. “To the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines I've served with, your shared sense of mission and purpose continues to make the journey work.”

U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, said Col. Donham has served as a battlefield surgeon, a combat veteran, a special forces operator, scholar, commander, and pioneer in military medical innovation. “His contributions go so far beyond his operational excellence,” she said.

U.S. Navy Honoree: U.S. Navy Capt. (Dr.) Matthew Tadlock

As a trauma and general surgeon with 23 years of active duty experience, Tadlock currently serves as the officer in charge, Surface Medical Group-Pacific, where he prepares fleet surgical teams for deployment on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships.

Since 2021, he’s led the Maritime Surgery Quality Improvement program, an initiative focused on tracking, improving, and standardizing all surgical care performed on U.S. combatant vessels. He is also an attending surgeon at Naval Medical Center San Diego and an associate professor of surgery through the Uniformed Services University.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Walter Brafford, commander, Naval Medical Forces Development Command, commended Tadlock, saying, “Under immense threat and pressure, often far from traditional medical facilities, Capt. Tadlock has relied not just on his own exceptional skills as a trauma and critical care specialist, but through his visionary leadership in shaping the very landscape of how we prepare and sustain our operational medical teams.”

“He doesn’t just maintain the status quo; he forges a new path.”

Tadlock thanked his family and fellow military medical professionals, saying, “Many of the accomplishments that led to this recognition, myself, or others, started at the grassroots level. To be recognized for being a part of these grassroots efforts and to see some of them become how we do business is incredibly rewarding.”

U.S. Air Force Honoree: U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Daniel Brown

“Every single success in military medicine is a shared achievement,” Brown said. “Especially true in the care and transport of those injured, a mission that has helped shape my career.”

Brown is an emergency services master clinician at Wright-Patterson Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he serves as the senior advisor to a 90-person emergency services flight and directs clinical operations for 13,000 emergency patients per year.

U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Jason Lennen, director of policy and resources at the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Air Force, told the audience, “Col. Brown's profound impact will be forever felt by the patients and staff he has directly touched, as well as the county centers that were built with the firm foundation that he has led to treat, heal and save, to enable our Air Force to fly, fight and win, and our joint force to deter, defend and defeat.”

U.S. Public Health Service Honoree: USPHS Capt. (Dr.) John Iskander

Iskander, currently assigned to the Food and Drug Administration, most recently served as chief of the immunization healthcare division for the Defense Health Agency and previously was chief of preventive medicine and population health for the U.S. Coast Guard.

U.S. Public Health Service Rear Adm. Denise Hinton, deputy U.S. Surgeon General, said Iskander, “is a distinguished leader whose contributions have profoundly advanced military and veteran medicine.”

“His career has been defined by excellence in clinical care, his groundbreaking medical research, and an unwavering dedication to those who serve as a physician leader within the United States Public Health Service Commission Corps.”

Iskander thanked those in attendance for the recognition for his service to the USPHS and emphasized the importance of the work of the agency, saying, “It is my privilege to accept this award with thanks to all my fellow United States Public Health Service officers who have and continue to serve our warfighters and veterans.”

Civilian Provider Honoree: Dr. Troy Akers

Akers is the civilian chief of emergency medicine at Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center, a position he transitioned into following his military retirement in 2018.

Dr. David Smith, acting director, Defense Health Agency, introduced Akers and talked about his heroic efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in 2024 that ravaged many communities in Georgia, including the area that relies on the Eisenhower Army Medical Center for medical care.

In the immediate hours of the destruction resulting from the storm, Smith said Akers went to the center and quickly began to respond to the needs of the community, patients, and his staff.

“This is what leadership is in crisis,” said Smith. “These are the actions of an individual who captures all the qualities we seek in our line of work: calmness, confidence, and compassion for those they serve.”

Akers said his job is “to make sure that the men and women that wear that uniform—the most precious resources this country has—have everything they need to make sure that they can fight America's wars, taking care of their family members when they're deployed, making sure they're medically ready, has been the honor of my life, and I thank every single day I get to do this job.”

Ambassador Honoree: Sal Gonzalez

Gonzalez enlisted in the Marines in 2004 and was assigned to the 2nd Battalion. While serving in Iraq, his vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a below-the-knee amputation.

While recovering from his injuries, he was introduced to many programs that offer rehabilitation and recovery of injured service members, including music. Since, he has performed at the Grand Ole’ Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and is about to release his first full-length album.

He “turned his healing journey into a mission, proving that music can give bridge to recovery, resilience, and renew purpose,” said Joseph Caravalho, president and CEO of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.

Gonzalez told the audience, “The only reason I am alive today is because of people like those who are being honored tonight. Because if I had been injured as grievously as I was injured in Iraq, just a couple of decades before—I do not think I would have survived.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/DVIDS/Articles/news497926.jpg?sc_lang=en&hash=712C466D03B7905495790168A86A456BB67021D7,N,1.0,2025-05-14 15:57:00.490484

With options like VA coverage, Tricare, and Medicare, the decision-making process can often feel complicated and confusing. That’s why Jordan Shears and Bashir Gray of Informed Choice Insurance joined us recently to shed light on this important topic.

Do Veterans Need Medicare If They Have VA or Tricare?

While VA and Tricare are both highly comprehensive, they may not cover every situation. According to Jordan Shears and Bashir Gray, Medicare provides a broader scope, especially when it comes to accessing doctors outside of the VA network. This can be especially beneficial for veterans who want more flexibility in their healthcare choices.

Are There Risks in Adding a Medicare Advantage Plan?

Bashir Gray clarifies that there aren’t necessarily “risks,” but there are important considerations. VA plans often come with smaller, more restrictive networks, while Medicare Advantage plans open the door to a wide range of civilian healthcare providers. For veterans who face long wait times or live far from a VA facility, this expanded access can make a significant difference.

Do Veterans Have to Go to a VA Hospital?

Absolutely not. As Jordan Shears explains, veterans are not limited to VA hospitals. Medicare Advantage plans can help bridge the gap by providing more convenient care options, especially for those who may live 30 to 40 minutes—or more—from the nearest VA location.

Why Informed Choice Specializes in Veteran Coverage

The team at Informed Choice Insurance has been working with Medicare clients for years. Their mission goes beyond selling insurance—they act as advocates, helping clients navigate the often confusing world of private healthcare. Whether it’s filing a claim or dealing with complicated paperwork, Bashir and Jordan aim to make the process easier and less stressful.

As the segment noted, the Veterans Administration is one of the most underfunded departments in the U.S. government. That makes the role of informed insurance experts even more valuable. Working with professionals who truly understand the process can help veterans cut through red tape and get the support they need faster.

This is the first time using my insurance for anything significant and I have some questions, specifically about Tricare Reserve Select if anyone has this same insurance. For reference, I am currently in the Army Reserves.

In talking to my neurologist, she said she has patients with the same insurance and that ""Tricare pays for ocrevus"". I trust her but I wanted to verify. I called the hospital and got the cash cost estimate of ~41k per treatment. I first checked the Tricare Formulary for the prescription benefit, it stated that ocrevus is not a covered prescription but that it may be covered under the medical benefit. I then called Tricare, they did confirm that my approved treatment authorization had it covered under the medical benefit. I then asked ""what exactly is covered and what sort of charges can I expect on the day of treatment?"" They said it would be the cost of an in-network specialty visit ($32), but when I pressed on if the ocrevus itself would be completely covered they said, ""We cant know that till after the treatment"". That sounded ridiculous to me so I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor said they would get a cost estimate for me and put me on hold for a loooooooong time and eventually came back with ""We cant know that till after the treatment"". I repeated this process again a couple days later thinking maybe I got someone on their bad day but got the same answer. How is that the answer? How is it that its IMPOSSIBLE for them to give me a cost estimate.

Granted I am pretty inexperienced with insurance and its sure not very straightforward but I can read and have read through the Explanation of Benefits for my tricare plan. I cant quite get a warm and fuzzy about what I am walking into cost wise. Does anyone have experience getting their MS treatment covered by Tricare? Specifically Tricare Select?

Dear Dr. Smith,

I write with great concern over reports that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is considering downgrading the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital to a clinic. I urge you to reconsider this and ensure that Fort Leonard Wood keeps its newly built hospital.

As you are no doubt aware, the DHA also moved to downgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s hospital under the previous Administration. I demanded Secretary Austin reverse course then, and have continued to remain engaged on the issue.

Downgrading this hospital would seriously harm soldiers, their families, and the broader community. It would jeopardize Fort Leonard Wood’s critical role as a major Army training center, including for Basic Combat Training and numerous advanced specialties.

The DHA has previously considered downgrading this hospital as a cost savings measure, but in point of fact such a move would represent the abandonment of over $400 million in recent investments to upgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s medical facilities. It would also impose additional costs on servicemembers assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, who would have to travel long distances to receive anything more than outpatient services.

A downgrade of this facility should not happen. I urge you to reconsider and reverse any determinations that have been made to do so. You must act to protect a hospital that is critical to servicemembers and constituents in my state.

Sincerely,

Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland (WA-10) is leading a bipartisan push to improve maternal health care for military families through expanded access to midwifery services. In recognition of the International Day of the Midwife, Strickland reintroduced the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act, a bill aimed at broadening maternity care options for servicemembers and their families enrolled in TRICARE.

“It is our job to support our servicemembers, and this includes providing help before, during and after childbirth,” said Strickland. “This bill expands midwifery care options, giving servicemembers and their families the care that they deserve.”

The legislation, co-led by Reps. Emily Randall (WA-06), Juan Ciscomani (AZ-06), and Jen Kiggans (VA-02), reflects a bipartisan commitment to expanding maternity care options for military families.

The proposed bill creates a five-year pilot program within TRICARE to cover services provided by credentialed midwives, with the goal of making that coverage permanent.

“Sexual and reproductive health care is essential, and we have a responsibility to ensure that service members and their families can access the care they deserve,” said Randall. “Expanding midwifery services through TRICARE is a critical step toward closing the dangerous gaps in maternal health care that too many people — especially those who serve our nation — are forced to navigate.”

The legislation has received endorsements from major national organizations including the American Association of Birth Centers, American College of Nurse Midwives, and the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM), among others. Advocates emphasize that the bill will help meet the growing demand for community-based maternal care and support military families in underserved areas.

“The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act directly addresses a critical gap in maternity care for military families by expanding TRICARE to include all credentialed midwives. By recognizing Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives as authorized providers, this bill not only increases access to care, especially in underserved areas, but also affirms the right of military families to choose safe community-based care,” said Cassaundra Jah, Executive Director of NACPM. “With over half of U.S. birth centers staffed by CPMs, this legislation will dramatically expand access to midwifery-led birth center services. NACPM strongly supports this bill as a meaningful, evidence-based solution that honors the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of our nation’s servicemembers and their families.”

Ciscomani, a father of six, spoke to the unique challenges faced by military families during pregnancy and childbirth.

“As our troops and their families serve our nation, they deserve access to the very best care, especially if they are looking to start or expand their family,” said Ciscomani. “As a dad of six I can tell you, planning to welcome a child to your family is an exciting time. However, serving in the military or having a spouse in uniform can pose additional difficulties for mothers-to-be. This is why I once again joined Rep. Strickland in a bipartisan effort to expand access to midwifery care for military spouses and women in uniform who are enrolled in TRICARE to ensure they can receive the care they need.”

Kiggans, a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, emphasized the importance of improving health outcomes for military families while easing the burden on the military health system.

“As a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, I know firsthand the importance of high-quality, accessible maternal care for our military families,” said Kiggans. “The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act is a commonsense, data-driven solution that expands care options under TRICARE, improves outcomes for mothers and babies, and helps reduce strain on military healthcare systems. I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to better support those who serve by delivering the care they and their families deserve.”",https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/local-pic-Marilyn-Strickland-Official-Photo_0.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-14 12:57:05.318033

The company will celebrate on social media, sharing patient and provider stories that highlight the impact NeuroStar has as a safe, effective, and non-drug treatment for depression

MALVERN, Pa., May 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuronetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STIM), a vertically integrated, commercial stage, medical technology and healthcare company with a strategic vision of transforming the lives of patients whenever and wherever they need help, with the leading neurohealth therapies in the world, is proud to launch the first National TMS Therapy Awareness Day. The event will take place each year on May 14 during May's Mental Health Awareness Month. This day is dedicated to raising awareness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a proven, non-drug treatment option for individuals living with major depressive disorder (MDD), depression with anxiety, and OCD, especially those who have not found relief through antidepressants.

""National TMS Awareness Day is about giving hope to people who haven't found relief and being a driving force in the National Mental Health Awareness conversation,” said Keith Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Neuronetics. ""Far too many individuals feel stuck or discouraged after trying multiple antidepressants without receiving adequate relief from their symptoms. By launching this National Day, we want to raise awareness that non-medication approaches like NeuroStar TMS therapy exist-and they're helping real people reclaim their lives. Our goal is to make sure every patient, caregiver, and provider knows that effective, non-drug treatments are available and within reach.”

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was first cleared by the FDA in 2008 for treatment-resistant depression in adults. Since then, it has become a widely adopted, evidence-backed modality for those who haven't responded to medication intervention. NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy in the United States-and in 2024, NeuroStar also received FDA clearance for use in adolescents, expanding access to younger patients in need of non-drug treatment options. Over 300 million people have insurance plans that cover NeuroStar TMS therapy, including Medicare and Tricare.

""One of the reasons NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy is the precision of our technology,” said Geoffrey Grammer, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Neuronetics. ""Our unique coil design is built to deliver focused magnetic pulses exactly where they're needed. Combined with our Contact Sensing feature, this ensures every session is both consistent and effective, helping patients get the most out of their treatment. We take pride in our scientific and engineering rigor, which continues to advance the field of TMS therapy and enhance the lives of our patients. On National TMS Therapy Awareness Day, we celebrate the real-world impact of NeuroStar TMS Therapy and the difference it makes.”

Kristen Gingrich, a licensed clinical social worker, mother, and patient advocate, has documented her experience with NeuroStar TMS after struggling with depression since her teens-worsened by postpartum challenges. After trying talk therapy and multiple antidepressants without lasting relief, she turned to NeuroStar TMS and is now sharing her treatment journey during Mental Health Awareness Month. Kristen's story, which can be seen on both her account (@notyouraveragethrpst) and NeuroStar social media channels, helps shine a light about non-drug options and inspire others facing similar struggles to seek help.

In addition to founding this awareness day, NeuroStar TMS continues its legacy as the leading TMS device company by presenting data at the 2025 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting (May 17-21). The poster ""The Profile of Symptom Change with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder” builds on prior research and evaluates TMS protocols and their treatment efficacy.

The company will celebrate on social media, sharing patient and provider stories that highlight the impact NeuroStar has as a safe, effective, and non-drug treatment for depression

MALVERN, Pa., May 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Neuronetics, Inc. STIM, a vertically integrated, commercial stage, medical technology and healthcare company with a strategic vision of transforming the lives of patients whenever and wherever they need help, with the leading neurohealth therapies in the world, is proud to launch the first National TMS Therapy Awareness Day. The event will take place each year on May 14 during May’s Mental Health Awareness Month. This day is dedicated to raising awareness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a proven, non-drug treatment option for individuals living with major depressive disorder (MDD), depression with anxiety, and OCD, especially those who have not found relief through antidepressants.

“National TMS Awareness Day is about giving hope to people who haven’t found relief and being a driving force in the National Mental Health Awareness conversation,” said Keith Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Neuronetics. “Far too many individuals feel stuck or discouraged after trying multiple antidepressants without receiving adequate relief from their symptoms. By launching this National Day, we want to raise awareness that non-medication approaches like NeuroStar TMS therapy exist—and they’re helping real people reclaim their lives. Our goal is to make sure every patient, caregiver, and provider knows that effective, non-drug treatments are available and within reach.”

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was first cleared by the FDA in 2008 for treatment-resistant depression in adults. Since then, it has become a widely adopted, evidence-backed modality for those who haven’t responded to medication intervention. NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy in the United States—and in 2024, NeuroStar also received FDA clearance for use in adolescents, expanding access to younger patients in need of non-drug treatment options. Over 300 million people have insurance plans that cover NeuroStar TMS therapy, including Medicare and Tricare.

“One of the reasons NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy is the precision of our technology,” said Geoffrey Grammer, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Neuronetics. “Our unique coil design is built to deliver focused magnetic pulses exactly where they’re needed. Combined with our Contact Sensing feature, this ensures every session is both consistent and effective, helping patients get the most out of their treatment. We take pride in our scientific and engineering rigor, which continues to advance the field of TMS therapy and enhance the lives of our patients. On National TMS Therapy Awareness Day, we celebrate the real-world impact of NeuroStar TMS Therapy and the difference it makes.”

Kristen Gingrich, a licensed clinical social worker, mother, and patient advocate, has documented her experience with NeuroStar TMS after struggling with depression since her teens—worsened by postpartum challenges. After trying talk therapy and multiple antidepressants without lasting relief, she turned to NeuroStar TMS and is now sharing her treatment journey during Mental Health Awareness Month. Kristen’s story, which can be seen on both her account (@notyouraveragethrpst) and NeuroStar social media channels, helps shine a light about non-drug options and inspire others facing similar struggles to seek help.

In addition to founding this awareness day, NeuroStar TMS continues its legacy as the leading TMS device company by presenting data at the 2025 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting (May 17-21). The poster “The Profile of Symptom Change with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder” builds on prior research and evaluates TMS protocols and their treatment efficacy.

The Pentagon has officially halted gender-affirming care for active duty military personnel in accordance with an executive order from President Trump that demands the firing of any member of the United States military who has received a diagnosis of, or treatment for, gender dysphoria, according to Reuters.

The memo seen by Reuters is alleged to have “barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops,” even though TRICARE, the healthcare provider for active duty military personnel in America, has long refused to cover gender-affirming surgeries in most cases.

Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, is alleged to have instructed in the memo that the recipients “immediately implement this guidance.” When asked for comment, the Pentagon directed Reuters to speak with the Defense Health Agency, who facilitate healthcare services for the armed forces. The DHA had not responded to Reuters’ request for comment before publication.

This news comes on the heels of another memo Reuters obtained last week in which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth demanded that the Pentagon start forcibly separating active duty transgender troops who had not left on their own by June 6. Troops in the armed forces reserves had until July 7th to voluntarily separate. On this memo, too, the Pentagon provided no comment. Hegseth simply tweeted, “No More Trans @ DoD.”

According to Reuters, officials have estimated that there are 4,240 transgender troops in the US military. This figure is somewhat contentious: activists defending trans rights often estimate higher, and in 2018 the now defunct Palm Center UCSB think tank estimated that there were 14,707 transgender Americans serving in the armed forces; 8,980 active duty, and another 5,727 in the reserves. There are approximately 2.86 million military personnel in the United States, meaning even the highest estimates of transgender troops account for less than half of one percent of all troops. How such a small minority could possibly compromise military readiness, as the Trump administration insists they do, is unclear.

The battle over transgender troops has been waged in federal courts since Trump’s executive order was issued in January, with two separate federal judges issuing sweeping pauses on the separation of transgender troops from the military. Unfortunately, last week the Supreme Court rubber stamped a request from the Trump administration to let them carry on firing transgender military personnel and denying them healthcare, and determine the constitutionality of that maneuver at a later date. The issued approval was one page, provided no explanation of the conservative justices’ rationale, and noted that the progressive judges dissented.

This is just the latest move in Trump’s war on inclusivity in the military. Over the weekend, leaders at the Pentagon were instructed to identify and remove materials that promote “divisive concepts and gender ideology.”

It’s unclear exactly how these separations will be processed, and whether or not transgender troops who are separated from the military, involuntarily or otherwise, will retain access to benefits such as the GI Bill or VA healthcare. In particular, new guidance on trans healthcare at the VA last month declared that no new patients for gender dysphoria treatment would be accepted, but that active duty troops accessing gender affirming-care through TRICARE who then separated from the military and qualified for care through the VA would be eligible to transition their treatment plan to the VA. The Pentagon has provided no answers on whether or not these rules are still in place, so eager are they to purge transgender Americans from military service.

Whatever you think about our armed forces, I find it deeply upsetting that thousands of trans people will be unemployed, homeless and possibly without healthcare in the next 30 to 60 days. Discrimination against trans people in housing and employment is on the rise, after all. Besides that, I simply cannot stomach the notion of transgender Americans being systematically excluded from any group that cisgender Americans have free access to; this is, it should go without saying, one of the first steps down a very scary road.

We’ve lost this battle. I hope we can win the war.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/633303d5ccf756402b93f25c/t/68243c21f9c8016586004746/1747205153545/671ac29ac65b23.00193110.png?format=1500w,N,-1.0,2025-05-14 06:56:21.985636

The 81st Medical Group on Keesler Air Force Base, Miss., the 673rd Medical Group on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, and Brooke Army Medical Center on Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, are among the 16 military hospitals that received top honors for their excellence in transparency and delivery of safe, high-quality care.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade, according to a DHA release.

KEESLER KUDOS

This year marks Keesler Medical Center’s second consecutive year on Leapfrog’s “honor roll.”

The 81st Medical Group maintains medical readiness for worldwide contingencies by providing quality, cost-effective health care for more than 27,000 enrollees, including almost 7,500 active-duty members. It also oversees five military treatment facilities from Mobile, Alabama, to New Orleans, Louisiana, coordinating care for 80,000 beneficiaries along the Gulf Coast.

“This accomplishment marks a significant milestone for our hospital,” said Air Force Col. Peter Kulis, commander of the 81st Medical Group and director of Keesler Medical Center. “Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do — from the smallest interaction to the most critical decisions. I’m deeply proud of our team, whose commitment and excellence ensure our patients receive the safest, highest-quality care possible.”

NORTHERN STARS

This year marks JBER’s third consecutive time scoring an “A” grade.

JBER hospital, fondly known as “J-Bear,” is a joint venture between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs that offers primary, specialty, outpatient, and inpatient care to 25,000 enrolled beneficiaries in the Anchorage area.

“Our third consecutive ‘A’ grade from Leapfrog is a direct reflection of the relentless commitment our Airmen and staff demonstrate every day to patient safety, high-reliability practices, and mission-ready care,” said Air Force Col. Laura Baugh, 673rd Medical Group commander. “This recognition belongs to the 673rd Medical Group team, whose discipline and dedication continue to set the standard for military medicine.”

BAMC BRILLIANCE

Brooke Army Medical Center also made the spring “honor roll.”

BAMC is the largest and most robust military hospital and the only Level I Trauma Center within the Department of Defense, providing safe, quality care to service members, their families, veterans, and civilian emergency patients.

BAMC serves more than 250,000 military beneficiaries within San Antonio and the surrounding communities. As a Level I Trauma Center, BAMC administers lifesaving care to civilian emergency patients from across 22 counties in Southwest Texas.

“BAMC is committed to providing our patients the best quality and safest care possible, and these results exemplify that commitment,” said Army Col. Kevin Kelly, BAMC commander. “We are very proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.”

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation is also intended to foster transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and healthcare systems, leading to continual process improvement.

Did Zynex Deceive Investors with Inflated Revenue Figures? Lawsuit Alleges Misleading Practices

The lawsuit contends that Zynex engaged in a scheme to inflate its reported revenue by routinely sending patients more products, including electrodes, than were medically necessary. This practice, the suit alleges, drew scrutiny from insurers, most notably Tricare, the health care program for active-duty and retired U.S. military personnel, potentially leading to adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

Concerns surrounding Zynex's business practices were amplified on June 4, 2024, with the publication of a report in the medical journal STAT. The report, titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" detailed what it described as an ""oversupplying scheme"" whereby Zynex allegedly sent excessive monthly supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to generate higher billings to insurers. Following the publication of the STAT report, Zynex's stock price reportedly fell by more than 5 percent.

The lawsuit further highlights Zynex's disclosure on March 11, 2025, when the company announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. In its report, Zynex revealed a significant revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter, attributed to slower payments from certain payers. The company also disclosed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments while it reviewed prior claims. This announcement triggered a sharp decline in Zynex's share price, plummeting by more than 51 percent, according to the legal filing.

Tricare Suspension Exacerbates Financial Woes: Post-Lawsuit Report Reveals Deepening Revenue and Profit Decline.

The financial repercussions of the Tricare payment suspension and the alleged prior practices became more evident after the lawsuit was filed. On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported a substantial decline in its first-quarter 2025 financial performance. Net revenue for the quarter plummeted to $26.6 million, a sharp decrease from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also saw its gross profit margin contract significantly, falling to 69 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 80 percent in the prior year. This downturn resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million for the quarter, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

During the subsequent earnings call, Zynex Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sandgaard directly addressed the TriCare payment suspension as a primary factor contributing to the disappointing first-quarter results. Mr. Sandgaard stated that the disruption had a significant impact on revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring effort to prepare for a potential prolonged halt in TriCare payments.

Looking ahead, Zynex has issued a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025 and anticipates an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.20. Reflecting the considerable uncertainty surrounding its relationship with TriCare, a key payer, the company has withheld its full-year financial guidance.

Hagens Berman's Launches Inquiry into Zynex's Disclosures Amidst Financial Turmoil

Shareholder rights law firm Hagens Berman has announced an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Zynex's recent financial disclosures and the allegations leveled in the class-action suit.

""Our investigation seeks to determine whether the company sufficiently revealed the potential pitfalls inherent in its billing methodologies and its dependence on TriCare's financial contributions,"" said Reed Kathrein, the partner spearheading the firm's probe.

That number is even higher for those who are serving or have served in the U.S. military, often due to the stress and trauma that service members endure.

If you are a military member or retiree, you and your family may be eligible for TRICARE, which covers many mental heath services. You do not have to suffer with mental health issues alone. Help is available.

What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE, a program of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System, provides civilian health benefits for military members, retirees, and their dependents. TRICARE offers several plan options depending on eligibility, but active military members are eligible for TRICARE Prime, which comes with few out of pocket costs.

Why Mental Health Services Matter

Often, people hesitate to seek mental health care, in part because of the stigma of mental illness. However, it’s important to recognize that people with mental health issues are not weak or defective. They simply suffer from a disorder that many other people also struggle with, and those disorders are treatable. With treatment, people with mental health disorders can get better and feel better and live more fulfilling lives. No one should suffer in silence when help is never more than a phone call away.

TRICARE Plan Options

TRICARE has seven main plan options.

TRICARE Prime: Prime is offered to active military members and their families and has the lowest out of pocket costs compared to other plans. It is similar to a health maintenance organization (HMO) plan and features the use of military hospitals and clinics.

TRICARE Select: Select is similar to a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan and allows you to choose your TRICARE providers. However, out of pocket costs with this plan are higher.

US Family Plan: The family plan is only available in certain areas and covers care only by their authorized providers. Care at military hospitals and clinics is not covered.

TRICARE Reserve Select: This plan is premium based and covers care with TRICARE authorized providers. It is available to Selected Reserve members and their families.

TRICARE Retired Reserve: Available to members of the Retired Reserve, this plan is similar to TRICARE Reserve Select.

TRICARE Young Adult: A premium based plan for young adult children of eligible military members. Prime or Select coverage may be chosen.

TRICARE For Life: A plan that supplements Medicare coverage.

Outpatient Mental Health Services Covered

Outpatient services are available at some military facilities and through TRICARE authorized providers. Some common outpatient services that are covered include:

Psychological testing and assessment

Psychotherapy

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) – Therapy several times per week

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs) – Daytime treatment, six or more hours a day, up to seven days a week

Inpatient Services Covered

Inpatient services covered include:

Inpatient hospital services for psychiatric emergencies and substance abuse withdrawal

Psychiatric residential treatment centers for children and adolescents

Mental Health Emergency Services

In the case of a mental health emergency, emergency room visits are covered as long as you contact TRICARE within 72 hours of admission. You can also call 988, the Veterans Crisis Line.

Common Mental Health Disorders Among Veterans

The most common mental health disorders among veterans are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.

PTSD is generally caused by one or more traumatic events that occurred while serving. Active duty service members often live through traumatic events, which is why nearly 25% of veterans who are cared for by VA services have had PTSD at some point in their lives. Symptoms of PTSD include flashbacks, severe anxiety, nightmares, and uncontrollable thoughts about the traumatic event or events.

Depression often occurs due to feelings of isolation after transitioning back to civilian life. Symptoms of depression include loss of interest in activities, persistent sadness, difficulty concentrating, and changes in appetite.

Anxiety is often caused by being consistently exposed to stressful situations while in service. Symptoms include constant worrying, restlessness, nervousness, difficulty concentrating, and rapid heartbeat.

Substance use disorders, which include alcohol and drug use disorders, are common as well, and often co-occur with other common mental health disorders among veterans. Bridges of Hope is a TRICARE authorized provider offering several treatment options for substance use disorders.

This list is not all-inclusive, so if you are suffering with symptoms that don’t fit these disorders, you should still seek mental health care. Everyone responds differently to the extreme stress and trauma associated with military service, so reach out for help no matter what you’re struggling with.

,,2025-05-13 23:42:59+00:00,Women's eNews,She Was Here: The Erasure of Women from America's Story,"Jean Kilbourne, Silvia Rodriguez Vega, Jacquese Armstrong, Yasmin Tarver",,,,,https://womensenews.org/2025/05/she-was-here-the-erasure-of-women-from-americas-story/,"Fortunately, two nonprofit organizations dedicated to telling women’s stories, the National Women’s History Museum and the National Women’s Hall of Fame, are not dependent on government funding.
The Hall will continue to tell their stories in its mission to combat the erasure of women’s contributions to the world.
In science and technology, this problem is so pervasive it has a name: the Matilda Effect—the systematic process of overlooking, miscrediting, or erasing women’s contributions to scientific achievement.
The term is named for 1995 National Women’s Hall of Fame Inductee Matilda Josyln Gage, who identified this bias as early as 1870 in her work as a suffragist and civil rights advocate.
Over three hundred women have been inducted into the Hall so far, each one with a powerful story.","On his very first day in office, President Donald Trump fired Admiral Linda Fagan, the first woman in American history to lead a branch of the armed forces. She was evicted from her residence with three hours’ notice. Weeks later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first female Chief of Naval Operations. Soon thereafter he fired Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, the senior military assistant to the secretary of defense, and then Telita Crosland, the former head of the military’s Defense Health Agency, forced to retire after a 32-year career.

The purge didn’t stop at leadership. At the same time, the Army and Navy removed all web pages that highlighted the history and contributions of female soldiers and sailors. A page entitled “Navy Women of Courage and Intelligence” was replaced by a “Page not found” message. The Pentagon has removed many thousands of posts about and photos of female military members.

The message is clear: women in power will no longer be recognized – or even tolerated.

It is not just military women who are being erased. Hundreds of federal government websites have removed any mention of women’s achievements and words such as “women,” “female,” and “feminism.” The White House released a list of words that National Institutes of Health grant seekers may no longer use, including “women.” Trump has also ordered NASA to eradicate all mention of women in leadership from its websites. In a term straight out of Brave New World, Trump refers to these acts as “defending women.” As he said at one of his rallies, he would be a protector of women “whether they like it or not.” This is especially ironic coming from a man who has been found liable for sexual assault by a jury of his peers and has been credibly accused of sexual abuse and harassment by over two dozen women.

We are fast living in a world in which women are becoming invisible (except as sex objects or baby machines) and our achievements are being erased. While it isn’t entirely true that “you cannot be what you cannot see,” it will certainly become more difficult for girls to believe they can be anything they want to be–-and for boys to grow up respecting girls and women. “If you erase the memory, we really forget the people,” said Alessio Ponzio, a visiting professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland. “It’s an act of violence that is very subtle but can really destroy the psychology of people. Basically, ‘I’m telling you that I do not recognize you.'”

In the words of author Lydia Millet, “Storytelling will never be the same as action. But action depends on a perception of possibility, which only arises from the tales we tell ourselves.” I would add that the perception of possibility also arises from the tales we are told by others. We must fight back by telling the stories of women who have done exceptional things, often in the face of discrimination and oppression. In recent years, museums have increasingly told these stories–but museums, even ones as iconic as the Smithsonian, are now being overhauled to revert to a historical lens that leaves out the women and people of color who shaped our nation.

Women have always been almost nonexistent in public artwork. Less than seven percent of national monuments honor women. As Rebeca Solnit said in “City of Women,” “A horde of dead men . . . haunt New York City and almost every city in the Western world.”

In the spring of 2024, President Joe Biden issued an executive order instructing the National Park Service to “highlight important figures and chapters in women’s history.” “Women and girls of all backgrounds have shaped our country’s history, from the ongoing fight for justice and equality to cutting-edge scientific advancements and artistic achievements,” the announcement read. “Yet these contributions have often been overlooked. We must do more to recognize the role of women and girls in America’s story, including through the Federal Government’s recognition and interpretation of historic and cultural sites.” If you attempt to find this order on a government website, you will find “Page not found.” The Trump administration has completely undone this order and seems to be in the process of undoing the National Park Service altogether.

Fortunately, two nonprofit organizations dedicated to telling women’s stories, the National Women’s History Museum and the National Women’s Hall of Fame, are not dependent on government funding. The Museum’s “ultimate vision is a more representative history and a more collective future, ensuring women’s history is an integral part of American history.”

The mission of the Hall is to advance gender equity (a phrase removed from all government websites) through action, education, and storytelling. In spite of the name, only about ten percent of women in the Hall are famous. The overwhelming majority are women who have groundbreaking accomplishments but are most often not recognized or celebrated outside of their particular fields. Women like Oveta Culp Hobby, the first director of the Women’s Army Corps and the first female to attain the rank of United States Colonel, and Sheila Widnall, the first female Secretary of the Air Force. The Hall will continue to tell their stories in its mission to combat the erasure of women’s contributions to the world.

This epidemic of erasure isn’t new—and it isn’t limited to the current administration. Many are familiar with famous female authors writing under male pseudonyms as a workaround for gender discrimination.

In science and technology, this problem is so pervasive it has a name: the Matilda Effect—the systematic process of overlooking, miscrediting, or erasing women’s contributions to scientific achievement. The term is named for 1995 National Women’s Hall of Fame Inductee Matilda Josyln Gage, who identified this bias as early as 1870 in her work as a suffragist and civil rights advocate. Yes, 1870!

Why have most Americans never heard of Dr. Patricia Bath, the first person to develop laser cataract surgery? Or Alice Evans, a scientist whose work led to mandatory milk pasteurization, saving countless lives worldwide. Or of Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet Nation who fought for Native American rights? Or of Bessie Coleman, the first Black female aviator? Or of St. Katharine Drexel, an American-born saint who dedicated her life and fortune to aid Native Americans and Black Americans?

The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.
“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch.
Using military dental clinics In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics.
Regular dental care for children supports not only their oral health, but their overall well-being.","Did you know that oral health has important links to your overall health? That’s why it’s especially important that children get proper dental care from an early age. This helps them maintain healthy teeth and gums throughout their lives.

Luckily, the TRICARE Dental Program, administered by United Concordia, has you covered. The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.

“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch. “It ensures your child has access to high-quality dental care that helps establish healthy habits early.”

Automatic enrollment at age 1

The TDP automatically enrolls your child in your dental plan when they turn age 1, if there’s a family member currently enrolled. This enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following your child’s birthday.

It’s important to be proactive with your child’s oral health in the early stages. Bring your child to their first dental appointment after their first tooth appears, but no later than their first birthday. Most babies’ teeth start to grow in at around 4 to 6 months old.

If you had a single plan before your child turned 1, your premium will change from the single plan rate to the family plan rate when your child is enrolled.

Costs

Your TDP monthly premiums are based on your sponsor’s status, rank and your enrollment type. Enrollment types include:

• Sponsor only

• Single enrollment (one family member, not sponsor)

• Family enrollment (more than one family member, not sponsor)

• Sponsor and family

Your cost-shares depend on your sponsor’s pay grade and where you live.

Coverage duration

Children can keep their TDP coverage until the end of the month they turn 23 if they:

• Are unmarried

• Attend an approved institution of higher education full-time

• Get at least half their financial support from their military sponsor

If your child stops meeting any of these conditions before turning 23, their coverage ends at the end of the month the change occurs. Additionally, if your child doesn’t meet these conditions at age 21, they’ll lose TRICARE coverage.

Services covered by TDP

The TDP covers a wide range of dental services for children, as described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook:

• Regular checkups and cleanings

• X-rays and evaluations

• Fluoride treatments

• Sealants for cavity prevention

• Fillings and restorations

• Orthodontics (braces) when medically necessary

• Emergency dental care

Most children can receive two routine teeth cleanings and two topical fluoride applications every 12 months. Your dentist can recommend the right schedule for your child’s needs.

Service frequency

The TDP provides coverage based on the following timeframes:

Every 12 months:

• Two oral checkups

• One set of bitewing X-rays

• Two routine cleanings

• Two fluoride applications

Every 36 months:

• One full mouth X-ray

• Sealants on permanent molars through age 18

Finding a dentist

To find a CONUS dentist, search the United Concordia network. If you’re overseas, use the OCONUS Find a Dentist tool.

Using military dental clinics

In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics. But in certain situations, they may. These situations include:

Emergencies

Certain special dental cases in children

Dental work related to treatment received at a military hospital or clinic

Your family members may be able to use overseas military dental clinics if they have space available. Check with your local overseas military dental clinic to find out what services they offer.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.
The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said.
Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.","The Pentagon is halting gender-affirming health care for transgender troops as it moves to implement President Donald Trump's plan to kick them out of the U.S. military, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.

“I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,” Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in the memo.

The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights said that the abrupt termination of healthcare was “needlessly disrespectful and cruel.”

“It is shameful that our nation’s military would treat any service member this way,” Minter said.

One transgender service member, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted, called the decision “the latest slap in the face” to troops serving honorably.

“If there was any doubt left, there is not anymore: transgender service members are no longer entitled to the same standard of medical care as their peers,” the service member said.

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 6 permitted Trump’s administration to implement his ban on transgender people in the military, allowing the armed forces to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out.

Reuters first reported last week a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6.

There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates.

Trump signed an executive order in January, after returning to the presidency, that reversed a policy implemented under his predecessor Joe Biden that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly.

A Gallup poll published in February found that 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals to serve in the military, but the support had declined from 71% in 2019.

A former Fox News host, Hegseth has embraced conservative stances on culture war issues, including eliminating diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.

Re-posting an article that said the Pentagon would resume treatments for transgender troops, Hegseth said: “If this is true — we will find any way possible to stop it.”

“Taxpayers should NEVER pay for this lunacy,” Hegseth added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/350513-us-soldier-silhouette-mn-1045-071967.jpg",N,0.0,2025-05-13 17:56:54.997532

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Heroes show their true colors when devastation hits.

When Hurricane Helene swept through the southeastern United States in 2024, it was the deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in almost 20 years.

Troy Akers, a physician and chief of emergency medicine at Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia, showed the world what real-world heroes look like in the storm’s aftermath.

Because of his heroism, Akers was named the 2025 Civilian Hero of Military Medicine in a ceremony on May 8, 2025.

The award recognizes Akers for his outstanding leadership, dedication to taking care of patients, and commitment to improving military medical practices.

""Dr. Troy Akers is a great example of the kind of dedicated person we are lucky to have in our unique health system,"" said Dr. David Smith, acting director of the Defense Health Agency.

Akers showed how he embodies selfless service during Hurricane Helene. Even though his own home was damaged, he focused on the needs of the community and the patients first.

""He grabbed a chainsaw and cut his way out of his home and local area so that he could reach the hospital. Which is where he stayed – around the clock – for the next eight days,"" Smith said. ""Dr. Akers stepped forward and made sure all patients were safely moved.""

The storm caused extensive damage, and the hospital lost power and water, forcing the evacuation of over 30 service members, family members, and civilians.

Akers coordinated the safe transfer of patients, including the critically ill, and worked with other hospitals to ensure everyone got the medical care they needed. He also led the effort to get the hospital back up and running after the storm.

Smith added, ""This is what leadership looks like during a crisis. These are the actions of someone who has the qualities we want: calmness, confidence, and caring for those he serves.""

Besides his leadership in emergencies, Akers is committed to teaching and training. He created a training program to improve skills for handling high-risk medical situations, benefiting over 250 health care workers.

Leaders at DDEAMC praised Akers for making the DDEAMC Emergency Room one of the best in the military health system. Akers focused on making things better, they said, which helped the department exceed national standards.

“With his leadership, DDEAMC was the first DHA medical center to create an emergency department team of DHA civilian interfacility transport paramedics,” said Col. (Dr.) Mark Craig, DDEAMC’s deputy commander for clinical services, when recommending Akers for the award.

“During times of chaos, such as Hurricane Helene, I witnessed his heroic efforts firsthand,” Craig added. “His commitment extends beyond daily responsibilities, showcasing remarkable resilience in catastrophic situations.”

A veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, Akers previously served on active duty in the U.S. Army as an emergency medicine physician. During a deployment to Afghanistan as the flight surgeon for Task Force Viper, he took part in over 200 combat missions, often while under direct fire. He improved how patients were evacuated, saving lives, and for his actions, received the Bronze Star Medal. He was also named the 2011 Flight Surgeon of the Year by the Army Aviation Association of America.

""There are many ways to serve your country, and Troy Akers is a perfect example,” said Smith.

Akers clearly began serving his country when he first raised his right hand and swore to defend the nation, and he continues to live by that oath now.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9032722/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-13 13:56:24.409755

They resubmit the claims, and Tricare comes back and says something to the effect of ""patient could not be identified as ours"".
I got claim numbers from the providers and asked Tricare about them and they said they had no record of them.
When I told the Tricare rep I wanted to do that she said that wasn't allowed and they could only talk to provider claims.","Update: I spoke to Tricare again and was able to get somewhere. We added one of the providers onto the call, and discovered that Tricare has switched their claims center from Wisconsin to South Carolina. My provider was unaware and had mailed my claim to Wisconsin. If anyone else in the east region is having a similar issue, I can provide the new address, fax number, and payer ID that your provider will need to submit a claim to the right location.

Thank you to whoever takes the time to read this. I've been having an absolutey awful time with Humana military/Tricare east this year, after 3 previous years with no trouble.

I have 3 providers after me for a combined total of 30,000 in medical bills that should be Tricare's responsibility. Two of these are providers I have been seeing for years with no issues.

I talk to their billing departments and go over how the claim was submitted, making sure they use my correct benefits number and other personal info. They resubmit the claims, and Tricare comes back and says something to the effect of ""patient could not be identified as ours"".

So I call Tricare. They are adamant that I am insured, evidenced by the claims that have been approved this year, some from the same providers on the same day as the one that are getting denied. They saiy it is an issue with how the providers are submitting the claim.

I can see the approved claims in my EOB, but the denied claims don't show up at all. I got claim numbers from the providers and asked Tricare about them and they said they had no record of them.

The providers are adamant that the claims are submitted correctly. One even offered to go on a 3 way call with me to try to get it straightened out. When I told the Tricare rep I wanted to do that she said that wasn't allowed and they could only talk to provider claims.

Now I feel backed into a corner with no idea what to do next and terrified these bills will fall on me. What can I do next at this point in the process?

I haven't been sent to collections yet but one of the providers is starting to get a little more aggressive.",,N,-1.0,2025-05-13 14:56:37.134743

Sgt. Loura Javier, surgical technician, 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, is leading a groundbreaking training partnership between JBER and Alaska Native Medical Center, a 182-bed, level 2 trauma hospital in Anchorage.

Javier designed and launched a rotational training program that places one Defense Health Agency surgical technologist at a time into ANMC’s 11-suite operating room department for a month-long immersive experience.

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts. “This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees. “Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

Javier’s forward-thinking approach is setting a new standard for training innovation within military medicine. Her efforts are not only advancing individual proficiency but also ensuring that JBER’s surgical technologists are better prepared for any operational challenge.

“Her leadership has created a model for future partnerships,” said Col. Laura Baugh, commander 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier embodies the spirit of excellence, and her work will have a lasting impact on the future of military medical training.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9030512.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-13 15:56:36.154285

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022.
“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt.
“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care—it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said.
Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health.","SAN DIEGO, Calif. — Naval Medical Center San Diego held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the expansion of its 1 West inpatient mental health ward—an initiative that marks a significant step forward in strengthening behavioral health care for active duty service members, veterans, and beneficiaries.

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022. Through a coordinated vision shared among leadership, clinical departments, facilities staff, and safety experts, the project was brought to life with the goal of increasing access, improving therapeutic outcomes, and reinforcing the Navy’s commitment to warfighter readiness.

""When our service members are struggling, it affects not only their individual readiness but the collective strength of our force,"" said Rear Adm. Guido Valdes, Commander, Naval Medical Forces Pacific, and Director, Defense Health Network Pacific Rim. ""By delivering high-quality, evidence-based mental health services in a secure and supportive environment, this unit will ensure our warfighters receive the care they need to recover and return to duty—or transition with dignity to the next phase of their lives.""

The newly expanded 1 West ward moves NMCSD closer to its goal of increasing capacity from a historic 36-bed limit across the 1 North and 1 West units to a total of 48 beds by the end of the calendar year. The initiative is expected to eliminate active-duty disengagements to civilian care, improve engagement with veterans and beneficiaries, and generate an estimated $22.7 million in annual purchased care savings once all 24 new beds are staffed and in use.

“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt. Elizabeth Adriano, Director of NMCSD. “By retaining our service members in a military treatment facility, we preserve readiness, reduce costly external placements, and expand care access to those who have served and continue to serve.”

The original 1 West ward was last renovated in 2008, primarily to meet updated safety requirements. The current expansion project not only reinforces safety standards with structural upgrades—including ligature-resistant door hardware, lock replacements, and improved CCTV—but also places a strong emphasis on enhancing the therapeutic environment. Patients now benefit from access to a large outdoor courtyard, greater privacy, and improved treatment areas that support individualized care.

Additionally, the Program of Care has been refined to offer tailored therapeutic experiences, aligning treatment groups and clinical interventions with each patient’s specific diagnosis and symptom profile.

“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care—it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said. Cmdr. Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health. ""In addition, the expansion allows us to accept and treat a more diverse group of patients, which directly serves our multiple training programs, including the Navy’s largest psychiatric residency.”

The project’s success was the result of a joint plan of action and milestones developed by the Directorate for Mental Health and the Directorate of Nursing Services, encompassing hiring initiatives, infrastructure improvements, space reorganization, and key procurement milestones.

The ribbon-cutting event highlighted the collective dedication and vision of the NMCSD team to deliver high-quality, mission-aligned behavioral health services that preserve the force, support families, and promote holistic well-being.

The mission of NMCSD is to provide a superior experience for our patients, staff, and warfighters. NMCSD employs more than 5,000 active-duty military personnel, civilians, and contractors in Southern California to deliver exceptional care afloat and ashore.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9031550.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-13 14:56:41.805157
