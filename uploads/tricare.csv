How Medicare works with TRICARE Medicare and TRICARE work together to cover your healthcare costs.
If both Medicare and TRICARE cover a service: Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.
If you receive a service covered only by Medicare: Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.
If the service you receive isn’t covered by either Medicare or TRICARE: Medicare pays nothing.","As you age, it’s important to think about your future health needs. If you’re eligible for Medicare at age 65, TRICARE has you covered if you take the appropriate steps. Once you actively have Medicare Part A and Part B, you’re automatically enrolled in TRICARE For Life. TFL coverage allows you to get the care you need while minimizing out-of-pocket expenses.

“TFL is what we call ‘wraparound’ coverage to Medicare for TRICARE-eligible retirees,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Understanding your coverage is key to maximizing benefits and minimizing healthcare costs as you age.”

Here’s what you need to know about TFL.

Signing up for Medicare

You need both Medicare Part A and Part B to get TFL coverage. You’re eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B if you’re:

Aged 65 or older

Under age 65 with certain disabilities

Any age with end-stage renal disease

You must apply for Medicare benefits. As mentioned in the TRICARE For Life Handbook, your initial Medicare enrollment period is a seven-month window. Remember to sign up for Medicare as early as possible. You should sign up for Medicare at least two months before the month you turn 65. This will ensure you don’t experience a gap in coverage.

How to get TFL

Getting TFL coverage is easy–you’ll transition automatically if you:

Are TRICARE-eligible

Have Medicare Part A and Part B

You don’t need to fill out any forms, and you don’t pay premiums for TFL coverage.

How Medicare works with TRICARE

Medicare and TRICARE work together to cover your healthcare costs. If both Medicare and TRICARE cover a service:

Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.

TRICARE pays the remaining amount.

You pay nothing.

If you receive a service covered only by Medicare:

Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.

TRICARE pays nothing.

You pay the Medicare deductible and cost-share.

Similarly, if you receive a service covered by TRICARE only:

Medicare pays nothing.

TRICARE pays the TRICARE-allowable amount.

You pay the TRICARE deductible and cost-share.

If the service you receive isn’t covered by either Medicare or TRICARE:

Medicare pays nothing.

TRICARE pays nothing.

You pay any billed charges.

If you have other health insurance based on employment, they pay in the following order:

OHI

Medicare

TRICARE

If your OHI isn’t based on employment, they pay in the following order:

Medicare

OHI

TRICARE

Choosing your provider

To get the most out of your TFL coverage, you should know the difference between Medicare provider types. These include:

Medicare-participating providers agree to accept the Medicare-allowed amount as payment in full.

Medicare non-participating providers don’t accept the Medicare-allowed amount as payment in full. They may charge up to 15% above the Medicare-allowed amount, which is then covered by TRICARE.

Opt-out providers opt out of Medicare and enter private contracts with their patients. Since they opt out, Medicare can’t pay for any healthcare services you receive. TRICARE pays the amount it would’ve paid if Medicare processed the claim. You’re responsible for paying the remaining charges. In this case, you must visit TRICARE-authorized providers and facilities. Otherwise, you may have significant out-of-pocket expenses.

Using TFL overseas

Since Medicare only covers care in the U.S. and U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), there are some key differences you should know. If you get care while living or traveling overseas:

You must have Part B to remain eligible for TRICARE, even though Medicare doesn't provide coverage overseas.

TRICARE becomes your primary payer.

You pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost shares.

You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

Be prepared to pay up front and file a claim within three years of the provided service.

Note that if you’re in the Philippines, you must visit a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Understanding Medicare Advantage Plans

Although you only need Medicare Part A and Part B to get TFL, you can choose to purchase a Medicare Advantage plan instead. Medicare Advantage plans:

Are also known as Medicare Part C

Are offered by private companies that contract with Medicare

Include services you receive with Medicare Part A and Part B

Usually include Medicare Part D (pharmacy coverage) and additional benefits

Medicare Advantage plans have additional requirements:

You may pay a plan premium each month on top of your Medicare Part B premium.

Generally, you need to use doctors and hospitals within the plan’s network to get the most coverage. This doesn’t apply to emergency services.

You may have to pay copayments at the time of service. You may need to file your own claim for TRICARE to reimburse copayments for TRICARE-covered services.

Keep in mind, if you have TFL, you still have TRICARE Pharmacy Program benefits at no additional cost. So, you don’t need Medicare Part D to cover your prescription drugs. With Medicare Part D, you may also pay a monthly premium, and you’ll need to follow the plan’s rules for filling prescriptions.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/20/2003673262/2000/2000/0/250320-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-03-20 14:56:27.667168

Studying how to prevent or mitigate brain injuries remains a key focus area for the Defense Health Agency. The science of the brain and brain injuries touches every capability that readiness demands.

For 25 years, more than 18,000 people from military families, local communities, and Department of Defense affiliates have visited the National Museum of Health and Medicine to participate in Brain Awareness Week activities.

In 2000, the NMHM partnered with the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives (now the Dana Foundation) to develop an educational program to coincide with International Brain Awareness Week. The program led middle- and high-school students (grades 5-12) through activities and stations with neuroscientists from universities, foundations, professional societies, museums, and hospitals to learn about advances in brain research, how the brain works, and possibly to inspire a new generation of neuroscientists.

“Brain Awareness Week came from the desire to expose students to the most powerful organ in the human body in an environment and in a manner that was enjoyable, fun, immersive, and educational at the same time,” said Archie Fobbs, the museum’s neuroanatomical collections manager.

Fobbs has participated as a presenter since the inception of the event. The NMHM Neuroanatomical Collections, one of the most comprehensive brain collections in the world was one of the main motivators to partner with the Dana Alliance and host BAW activities.

Over the years, the number of presenters grew, and the topics and activity stations became more specialized. Stations showed examples of brain injury and disease while discussing prevention and treatment, informed on how sports-related concussions contribute to tactile, speech, and language disorders, and taught about the impacts of traumatic brain injury because of recent military conflicts.

While the museum was housed at the then Walter Reed Army Medical Center, NMHM staff saw firsthand how patients recovered from TBIs. BAW shifted to focus on presenters and activities that centered on brain injury awareness research related to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of the warfighter and how it affects advancements in the civilian sector. When the museum moved to its current location in Silver Spring, Maryland, an entire gallery was dedicated to the brain.

One of the museum’s longest-running presenters is the Defense Health Agency’s Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence, whose first BAW activity station occurred in 2002 when the organization was named the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center.

""The Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence is proud to have been a part of the museum's Brain Awareness Week activities for over 20 years. Every year, we look forward to the opportunity to educate the public about why it's important to protect, treat, and defend their brain health. We've been able to drive this point home over the years through interactive activities such as egg drops, helmet fitting, and a mirror box that simulates how the brain changes after concussion,” said Dr. Katie Stout, chief of the Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence.

Other presenters throughout the years include National Institutes of Health institutes and centers, the Society for Neuroscience, DoD centers of excellence, Howard University, Rutgers University, University of Maryland, Georgetown University, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research’s Sleep Research Center, among others.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, NMHM closed its doors on Friday, March 13, 2020, just a few days before they would have welcomed students and presenters for its 20th BAW.

Not to be deterred, during the next two years, NMHM produced a social media campaign each March called “Back to Basics: The Brain,” with an accompanying online lab notebook for at-home activities. The videos showcased presentations by a collection of DoD partner organizations, including TBICoE, the Psychological Health Center of Excellence, the Hearing Center of Excellence, the Uniformed Services University, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, WRAIR, and several NIH organizations.

BAW returned in person with Brain Awareness Day as a two-hour public event on March 18, 2023.

“For a quarter century, NMHM has been a forum for expanding awareness for the neurosciences among the public and professionals alike. We often have visitors come back years later after participating in a Brain Awareness Week program, and they tell us how much they were impacted by their experiences interacting with our Neuroanatomical Collections and all of the brain experts. It’s an experience that both inspires curiosity and even careers,” said Andrea Schierkolk, NMHM’s public programs manager.

This year, NMHM celebrated its 25th year of Brain Awareness Week activities with a Brain Awareness Day on Saturday, March 15. Presenters included NMHM Anatomical Collections staff, TBICoE, PHCoE, HCE, the Vision Center of Excellence, Uniformed Services University, Society for Neuroscience, and the National Intrepid Center of Excellence.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8926403/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-20 13:56:28.718064

Smith, urging to improve TRICARE compensation in Northeast Florida.

As Rep. Bean explained, constituents have worried about the failure of T-5 contracts under the TRICARE program, where delays are common, and millions of dollars in compensation have been unpaid or unprocessed.

""This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country,"" Rep. Bean continued, adding, ""In Northeast Florida, service members and their families are already facing reduced access to medical care. We have heard from mothers pleading for our help to resolve the billing issues to make sure their children do not lose access to physical therapy, behavioral health providers, and surgical services. The most vulnerable are left hanging in the balance as these payment delays continue.""

Moreover, local medical practices serving TRICARE beneficiaries cannot meet demand, reducing or discontinuing services and potentially shuttering.

NBC News covered TRICARE East's slowness at the beginning of March, which affected not only Northeast Florida but also other parts of the East Coast.

As a result, the Florida Congressman demanded answers on how the delays would be solved when healthcare providers would be reimbursed, the number of beneficiaries at risk of losing coverage, and how the DHA would reach out to them.

TRICARE is not the first government service in Northeast Florida that Bean has criticized for working slowly. In October, he demanded answers from the Postal Service (USPS) on why mail had been continually lost or slow.

""Since January, I've had many constituents reach out with concerns regarding delivery delays and lost mail.

“Moving forward our hope is that members of Joint Base Charleston will receive better medical care and attention using the DHA virtual consultation,” Pritchett expressed.","Joint Base Charleston. S.C. - The 628th Medical Group began using the Defense Health Agency virtual care system Feb. 10, providing service members additional access to medical care.

Virtual consultations allow patients and doctors to discuss symptoms, diagnoses, and prescriptions completely through electronics.

“It's a great new tool in our toolbox,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Caleb Lesselles, 628th MDG practice manager. “It allows for further reach of the providers to our patient population.”

This new technology ensures a more patient-centered appointment and consultation, providing flexibility for service members and their families.

Patients can now book appointments around job schedules and family needs, mitigating time off of work. The patient receives timely notifications to their phone throughout the duration of the consults, allowing for a more connected and informed experience.

The DHA created the Virtual Education Center tool to help gauge and educate patients. The VEC equips patients to take command of their health-care. According to the DHA, patients who are well informed may make fewer appointments and require fewer medical procedures.

“From a mental health perspective, I think it's honestly super beneficial,” said U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Amanda Pritchett, 628th Operational Medical Readiness Squadron mental health supervisor and Alcohol Drug and Abuse Prevention technician.

According to Pritchett, people from all walks of life are treated at Joint Base Charleston. Whether it's a home situation or work concern, there are issues that need to be talked about. Rather than having to reschedule due to circumstances arising that prevent a patient from attending physically, the option to have a virtual appointment grants the person the same level of care.

The DHA uses virtual technology to partner with outside contracts such as the Enterprise Behavioral-Health Resources and Virtual Resource Clinical Services, that host telehealth psychiatrists to assist patients with virtual consults.

Since the roll-out of the virtual consultation, Lasselle and Pritchett have acknowledged that the overall user feedback has been good, both expressing their desire for patients to receive medical care in a timely fashion.

“Moving forward our hope is that members of Joint Base Charleston will receive better medical care and attention using the DHA virtual consultation,” Pritchett expressed. “And to be more satisfied with the medical staff assigned to the base.”

The DHA's vision transcends traditional healthcare boundaries and provides unwavering and exceptional healthcare support to service members, retirees, and their families.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-03-20 12:57:02.719453

TriWest Healthcare Alliance has a history of fraud allegations, including a $10 million settlement in 2012 for failing to pass on negotiated discounts to TRICARE and a $179.7 million settlement in 2020 for overpayments related to the VA's PC3 and Choice Programs. Here's a more detailed look: 2012 Settlement: In 2012, TriWest agreed to pay $10 million to resolve allegations that they failed to give TRICARE the benefit of negotiated discounts with service providers, submitting claims at higher rates and pocketing the savings. Whistleblower Lawsuit: The 2012 settlement stemmed from a lawsuit filed by four former TriWest employees under the False Claims Act, alleging that TriWest defrauded the government. 2020 Settlement: In 2020, TriWest agreed to pay $179.7 million to resolve allegations of overpayments from the VA in connection with its administration of the PC3 and Choice Programs. Alleged Overpayments: The 2020 settlement resolved allegations that TriWest retained overpayments from the VA, including payments for the same services twice and payments for services where TriWest received full or partial reimbursement from other healthcare providers.

The recent transition to TriWest Healthcare Alliance as the new contractor for TRICARE West has been marked by significant issues, including problems with beneficiary payment updates, provider network changes, and delays in accessing customer service and processing referrals. Here's a breakdown of the key issues: Payment Update Problems: Beneficiaries who pay for TRICARE coverage with debit, credit card, or bank transfer faced difficulties updating their payment information on the TriWest online portal, with some reporting long wait times to reach customer service. Provider Network Changes: Many beneficiaries and healthcare providers raised concerns about the new TriWest provider network, which was smaller than the previous Health Net Federal Services network. Customer Service Issues: Beneficiaries reported ""unending delays in reaching TriWest customer service"" and difficulties with the TriWest website and call centers. Referral and Authorization Processing: TriWest's referral portal experienced issues, affecting the processing of new referrals and some beneficiaries' specialists couldn't access approvals in the TriWest system. Coverage Gaps and Unpaid Claims: Some beneficiaries reported that they were not able to get their claims processed, leading to coverage gaps and unpaid bills. Extended Deadlines: The deadline for beneficiaries to update their payment information was extended twice, with the final deadline being February 28th.

TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays.
This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.""","U.S. Congressman Aaron Bean, representing Florida's 4th District, along with Congressman John Rutherford from the 5th District, have addressed a letter to Dr. David J. Smith, the acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The letter raises concerns about reimbursement issues affecting TRICARE beneficiaries and medical providers in Northeast Florida.

Congressman Bean has been receiving feedback from constituents and healthcare providers regarding problems with TRICARE compensation. Despite efforts by these parties to contact TRICARE independently, many have not seen their issues resolved.

The lawmakers stated: ""We have heard from countless concerned constituents that the new T-5 contract has had a severe impact on our military families and community medical providers. Providers across the nation have reported millions of dollars in unpaid or unprocessed claims. TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays. This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.""

The full text of the letter details further issues faced by service members and their families in Northeast Florida who are experiencing reduced access to medical care due to billing problems. Some mothers have expressed concerns over their children's continued access to necessary health services such as physical therapy and surgical services.

Providers serving TRICARE beneficiaries report significant financial strain due to unpaid services, with some clinics owed substantial amounts—upwards of $100,000—which affects around 30% of their patient population who are TRICARE patients.

The congressmen stressed that it is critical for this situation to be resolved swiftly to prevent military families from losing essential healthcare coverage. They posed several questions seeking clarity on when reimbursement delays would be resolved and what measures are being taken to prevent similar issues in the future.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/84/e0/22543432/webp_ds30s6a6lrwhkf36ohfrkf838kel.webp,N,-1.0,2025-03-20 00:26:11.705782

Senior Companion volunteers

The Senior Companion volunteers ages 55 and older provide basic social support to seniors over the age of 60 years old.

The seniors who receive volunteer services generally live alone, need respite care, have limited access to outside resources, and lack social support. Volunteer services may include taking clients to medical appointments, grocery shopping, running errands, socializing, or engaging in fun activities.

For qualifying volunteers, a small stipend is available for services; transportation reimbursement is provided for all volunteers.

This program is sponsored by AmeriCorps Seniors and the State of Nevada Aging and Disability Services Division.

Whether you’re new to the TRICARE Dental Program or a long term TDP beneficiary, it’s important to brush up on essential terms relating to your dental coverage. Understanding your TDP plan can help you make the most of your benefits. While navigating your coverage should be easy, some terms might be unfamiliar. Here’s a helpful guide to 10 common TDP terms you should know.

Authorized provider

Any dentist or dental hygienist approved to provide dental care in their state qualifies as an authorized provider. You can receive TDP benefits from any authorized provider, though you’ll usually save money by choosing a network dentist.

Network dentist

A network dentist has signed a contract with United Concordia, the TDP contractor, to accept the TDP’s allowable charge as full payment for covered services. These dentists offer discounted fees compared to the normal rates in your area. You also don’t have to pay for the full cost of care and wait for reimbursement. Network dentists coordinate TDP’s payment with United Concordia directly.

Non-network dentist

This is any dentist who hasn’t signed a contract with United Concordia. While you can still see these providers, you may have higher out-of-pocket costs.

TRICARE OCONUS preferred dentist

TRICARE OCONUS preferred dentists are dentists who have agreements with United Concordia to participate in the TDP. These providers will bill United Concordia directly for the program’s share of costs and offer English-language services. While you can see any licensed dental provider overseas, choosing a TOPD can make the process smoother.

Diagnostic services

These are services that help your dentist decide what dental care you need. Examples include X-rays and periodontal evaluations. These services are essential for proper treatment and procedure planning.

Orthodontic services

These services treat problems with your bite and speech. Common treatments include braces, retainers, and other devices that help align teeth properly.

Periodontal services

These treatments address diseases affecting the tissues surrounding and supporting your teeth, such as your gums. Regular cleanings help prevent periodontal disease, while you might need more advanced treatments for existing conditions.

Plan year

Your annual maximum benefit amount applies to this 12-month period, so keeping track of the plan year helps you manage your dental care expenses.

Understanding these terms can help you make better decisions about your dental care. By knowing how your TDP works, you can maximize your benefits and minimize out-of-pocket costs.

Allowable charge

This is the maximum amount United Concordia will pay for a dental service. For network dentists, the allowable charge is either their normal fee or a negotiated lower rate. If you visit a non-network dentist, you might need to pay the difference between the allowable charge and what your dentist bills.

Coordination of benefits

If you have more than one dental plan, United Concordia will work with your other insurance to determine which plan pays first and which pays second. Always file claims with your primary plan first, then submit to the secondary plan after receiving payment from the primary.

For more information about your TDP benefit and other dental terms, check out the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook.

Remember that good dental health is an essential part of your overall health.

Family members attended the hearing as Detective Stacey Rutherford provided testimony regarding the incident.

Testimony from Detective Stacey Rutherford:

At 8:15 p.m., a call was received reporting a shooting in Harvest. Just a few minutes later, dispatch confirmed a lone subject inside the store who appeared to be dead. Radio traffic alerted deputies to the situation.

Witnesses reported that Williams attempted to flag down vehicles near a field less than a quarter mile from the scene. Several individuals were in the parking lot, including a couple who were inside the Circle K when the shooting occurred.

Upon arrival, deputies found nothing disturbed in the lobby; all items were behind the counter. However, there were large amounts of blood and some items in disarray.

Detective Rutherford explained that multiple surveillance cameras in the store captured the incident. A screenshot showed the suspect standing at the counter, reaching over the customer closest to the register to produce a firearm and shoot Taylor North.

After executing a search warrant, investigators found clothing matching that seen in the screenshot, as well as pairs of white gloves, a gun, a shirt, and jeans in a bag belonging to Williams. He admitted that the gloves found in the bag were his.

Rutherford stated that the video showed Williams entering the store at 8:03 p.m., shooting North, and leaving in less than 30 seconds. When located later, Williams had changed his clothes.

During questioning from the defense, witnesses Henderson and DJ, who were at the counter during the incident, provided their accounts. A total of 185 crime scene pictures and videos from six surveillance cameras were presented as evidence. The shell casing from the scene and the weapon found were confirmed to be a match through ballistic testing.

Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.","GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba – Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, visited U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay to engage with leadership and staff on Feb. 27, 2025.

Ferrara’s visit underscores his commitment to engaging with medical personnel at military hospitals and clinics across the Military Health System to better understand their challenges and ensure they have the resources necessary to provide exceptional care.

As the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. “There is no substitute for boots-on-the-ground to understand the nature and complexity of any mission, especially one this complex,” Ferrara said. “I wanted to ensure the team was receiving the support they need to execute their mission successfully. U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo is a particularly vital military hospital in a remote location with a unique mission set, so seeing both the daily operations and unique operations like the joint expeditionary MEDEVAC training was invaluable for understanding the hospital's specific needs and how I can best support their critical work from my position. As the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I have a unique responsibility for detainee care, making it important that I gain a firsthand understanding of that unique mission.”

Managing a geographically remote military hospital comes with challenges in manning and occasionally supply chain procurement. Hospital Director U.S. Navy Capt. Tammy Servies, who also serves as commanding officer for U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command and commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo’s Joint Medical Group, doesn’t let that impede the mission with her focus on a ready medical force and a medically ready force. “We were very excited to welcome Dr. Ferrara to Guantanamo,” Servies said. “We provide care to a diverse community, including service members, their dependents, government civilian employees, contractors, and foreign national workers. It was very gratifying to show Dr. Ferrara that no matter who walks through our doors, we are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable health care. Our mission is rooted in operational readiness and wellness, ensuring that those we serve receive the best possible care.

“The health, wellness, and readiness of every service member I lead as the CO of USNMRTC Guantanamo, matters to me personally,” Servies continued. “My team cannot adequately care for others if they are not healthy themselves.”

During his visit, Ferrara met with a cross-section of sailors from every department within the hospital to speak with them and listen to what matters to the most junior members of the hospital team. “The dedication and resilience of the entire medical staff left a lasting impression on me,” Ferrara said. “It's one thing to hear about the demands of operating in a remote location, but witnessing the team's unwavering commitment to providing top-notch care across a range of disparate environments was truly inspiring.”

Servies echoed the significance of Ferrara’s visit, emphasizing the impact of leadership engagement in understanding the realities of providing health care in a remote setting. “Despite the challenges we face, my team never fails to amaze me with their willingness to take on every mission that comes our way,” Servies said. “Whether providing support to Joint Task Force Guantanamo, Joint Task Force Southern Guard, or managing the daily operations and patient load from our local community, these military and civilian personnel show an indomitable spirit and mental toughness that sometimes leaves me in awe.”

Ferrara’s visit highlights the ongoing efforts to strengthen military health care delivery and support the dedicated medical personnel who stand ready to serve whenever and wherever they are needed. “The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said. “The team's ability to maintain a constant state of readiness, adapt to diverse needs, and seamlessly collaborate with other units is a testament to their professionalism and commitment to excellence. The isolation of Guantanamo Bay is also easy to underestimate until walking the spaces. The team here has a mission like no other in the Military Health System.”

The Defense Health Agency manages military hospitals and clinics across the Department of Defense, integrating health care services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations.

This marks Pierce's second tour advancing neonatal care within military health care.
From 2013 to 2016, she helped establish the Special Care Nursery at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, eventually serving as its nurse manager.
Naval Hospital Guam,"" Pierce said.
Naval Hospital Guam's ability to provide exceptional neonatal care anytime, anywhere—always,"" Pierce said.","AGANA HEIGHTS, Guam — Navy Cmdr. Desirae Pierce has twice helped transform how naval hospitals care for their tiniest patients. Now, as U.S. Naval Hospital Guam's lead for the innovative Neonatal Stabilization and Treatment (NeST) team, she's enhancing care for newborns who need specialized medical support.

“We are increasing our ability to provide necessary and critical care for our smallest and most vulnerable beneficiaries,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Affairs. “The progress the NeST Working Group has achieved in less than a year is a testament to the entire team, but particularly the team at Naval Hospital Guam.”

NeST is a specialized team of medical professionals comprised of a neonatologist, neonatal intensive care nurses, and respiratory therapists who stabilize premature babies and newborns with health complications until they can be transported to a facility with a neonatal intensive care unit.

While the island of Guam does not have an accredited NICU, Pierce, who is a neonatal nurse practitioner, and her team have significantly increased the hospital's ability to care for newborns who need additional medical support.

Pierce explained that the NeST team has enabled a more nuanced approach to caring for some newborns who require specialized care. ""Previously, an aeromedical evacuation was initiated almost immediately for newborns who required specialized care,"" she said.

While the implementation of NeST does not delay evacuations, ""the team is capable of providing stabilization care and treatment for longer durations of time for newborns” who are stable enough to receive care on island, if the anticipated length of their treatment is about 10 days.

This marks Pierce's second tour advancing neonatal care within military health care. From 2013 to 2016, she helped establish the Special Care Nursery at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, eventually serving as its nurse manager. Now at USNH Guam, she's helping to lead another transformative effort in neonatal care.

""In my 17 years of service, I have twice had the privilege of playing a direct part in advancing neonatal care within a Naval Hospital,"" Pierce said. ""The path has been arduous, but with the continued support of the hospital and the Defense Health Agency, the future of neonatal care where America's day begins looks bright.""

Evolution of Care

The NeST program evolved from its predecessor, the Neonatal Stabilization Team (NeoSTAT) model, to expand specialized care for newborns born prematurely or with health complications. Recognizing Guam's geographic isolation—more than 1,400 miles from the NICU at USNH Okinawa and nearly 4,000 miles from Tripler Army Medical Center’s NICU in Hawaii—the hospital augmented its capabilities to address the reality that aeromedical evacuations can take up to seven days to coordinate, plus 8-16 hours of flight time.

The impact is significant for military families stationed in Guam. For example, a baby born at 35 weeks of pregnancy who is experiencing respiratory distress can now receive treatment locally rather than requiring immediate medical evacuation. This means some families can remain together on the island during their baby's treatment.

""Our priority is delivering the highest quality care to our service members and their families,"" said U.S. Naval Hospital Guam’s Director Capt. Joel Schofer. ""The NeST program demonstrates our commitment to enhancing our capabilities and ensuring our beneficiaries have access to safe, quality health care when and where they need it.""

Cutting-Edge Technology

The NeST team uses state-of-the-art equipment to provide specialized care to their tiny patients. Their advanced respiratory support system delivers nitric oxide generated from room air to help newborns with persistent pulmonary hypertension, a serious condition affecting oxygen and blood flow to the lungs. They also use specialized breathing equipment that delivers precise, tiny breaths to protect delicate newborn lungs, and an innovative cooling system designed to minimize brain injury in babies who experienced oxygen deprivation during birth.

""These devices allow the team to provide very specialized care that can minimize life-long consequences to the newborn.” Pierce explained. ""The technology helps us deliver the highest level of care possible within our capabilities.""

The team recently achieved a significant milestone when they successfully administered a medication that helps premature babies breathe more easily by coating their tiny lungs with a substance similar to what full-term babies naturally produce. By delivering this medication through a special airway mask—a first for the hospital—they helped a premature baby's lungs work better while avoiding the need for more invasive treatment.

Comprehensive Care Approach

""Staff develop a deep sense of commitment to providing the best care possible with the goal of improving patient outcomes,"" Pierce said. ""Neonatal patients don't have the luxury of choosing the circumstances to which they are born into and every intervention made will affect the rest of that infant’s life.""

The team also provides education and training to other hospital staff, participating in emergency response drills and teaching life-saving resuscitation skills. This commitment to education extends to support departments like radiology, pharmacy, laboratory, and the blood bank, whose staff have enhanced their capabilities to support neonatal patients.

Looking to the Future

With USNH Guam anticipating a potential growth in deliveries by 2033, the evolution of the NeST program ensures military families and other TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries have access to the highest level of care.

""NeST is evolving into what we hope will be a self-sustaining group of NICU-experienced staff who are more permanent to U.S. Naval Hospital Guam,"" Pierce said.

While Pierce is optimistic about the future, she wants expectant mothers to understand the scope of care available to them. The island of Guam does not have an accredited NICU and the naval hospital’s NeST program, while designed to ensure newborns have access to the best care possible until they can be stabilized or transported to a higher level of care, is not a NICU.

""The NeST team is enhancing U.S. Naval Hospital Guam's ability to provide exceptional neonatal care anytime, anywhere—always,"" Pierce said.

All counties are impacted.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Smith, the acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), raising concerns about ongoing reimbursement failures and their effects on Northeast Florida military families and medical providers.

Over the last several weeks, Congressman Bean has heard from concerned constituents and providers about significant issues with their TRICARE compensation. Despite their efforts to reach out independently to TRICARE, many constituents have not had their issues addressed.

In part, the Northeast Florida lawmakers wrote:

“We have heard from countless concerned constituents that the new T-5 contract has had a severe impact on our military families and community medical providers. Providers across the nation have reported millions of dollars in unpaid or unprocessed claims. TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays. This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.”

The full text of the letter may be found here and below.

Dear Dr. Smith,

We write to express our deep concerns regarding the impact of ongoing TRICARE East reimbursement issues on our military families and community medical providers. Our military families deserve the best possible care and support, and the current state of affairs is unacceptable.

We have heard from countless concerned constituents that the new T-5 contract has had a severe impact on our military families and community medical providers. Providers across the nation have reported millions of dollars in unpaid or unprocessed claims. TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays. This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.

In Northeast Florida, service members and their families are already facing reduced access to medical care. We have heard from mothers pleading for our help to resolve the billing issues to make sure their children do not lose access to physical therapy, behavioral health providers, and surgical services. The most vulnerable are left hanging in the balance as these payment delays continue.

Additionally, we are hearing from providers who serve TRICARE beneficiaries that they are already notifying patients that their services will be greatly reduced or discontinued. For one clinic, TRICARE patients comprise roughly 30% of their total patient population and they are owed around $100,000 for unpaid services. With providers not being reimbursed, small businesses with a heart for serving military and veteran families are at risk of shuttering.

It would be unacceptable for military families to lose access to critical health care coverage. This crisis must be immediately rectified, so that TRICARE payment services are restored, and providers can remain operational. To provide transparency and ensure accountability, we respectfully request answers to the following questions:

When do you anticipate the current reimbursement delays will be resolved?

What steps are you taking to ensure these delays are resolved?

When should providers who have not yet received payment for their services expect to be reimbursed by TRICARE?

How many TRICARE beneficiaries are expected to lose coverage due to a lack of recurring payment information, and what steps are being taken to proactively reach out to them?

What proactive steps are being taken to ensure that we do not face this critical payment issue again in the future?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.

This critical legislation would align the VHA with current Defense Health Agency policy that allows both Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) and physician anesthesiologists to be autonomous providers of anesthesia, while strengthening safety and transparency within the VHA.

The VHA has created unnecessary inefficiencies in providing anesthesia care for veterans. Ongoing physician anesthesiologist shortages and an increasing demand of aging veterans who need care mean that cumbersome supervision models are untenable. As CRNAs are trained as autonomous healthcare professionals who increasingly provide a greater share of safe anesthesia care nationwide, removing these barriers to care will benefit both veterans and taxpayers. Specifically, duplication in providing anesthesia care through unnecessary physician anesthesiologist supervision of CRNAs has consistently led to increased costs, longer wait times and delays, and even cancellations of care for veterans.

“As a veteran and practicing CRNA, I am excited to see Representatives Underwood and Kiggans introduce this critical legislation to help our veterans get the prompt care they deserve,” said Jan Setnor, MSN, CRNA, Col. (Ret), USAFR, NC president of American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA). “For too long Veterans have been denied timely access to care within the VHA due to outdated barriers and red tape that this bill would finally address.”

The failure of VHA’s current anesthesia models was highlighted by reports out of both the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) and the Hampton Roads VAMC, where burdensome models led to delays and cancellations of surgeries.

CRNAs are able to practice without the supervision of a physician anesthesiologist in 49 states and the District of Columbia, but the VHA continues to utilize inefficient models that are increasingly detrimental. Multiple independent groups have supported CRNA full practice authority within the VHA, including a recent report commissioned by Temple University.

“This bill brings the first major step towards improving and streamlining veterans’ care and experience through the VHA,” added Setnor. “Allowing CRNAs to practice autonomously, like all other advance practice nurses do within the system, would immediately increase the capacity of the VHA to provide anesthesia care or other airway management skills to Veterans and decrease costs.

However, empathy is currently underrepresented in medical education. Currently, no guidelines exist for integrating empathy training into medical schools or residency programs. The goal of this study was to pilot a workshop for medical students, residents, and fellows designed to enhance functional empathy skills and awareness. The relationship between physician empathy and improved patient outcomes is well-documented in the literature and is not the focus of this manuscript. This study concentrates on the development of new empathy training and its integration into the medical curriculum.

Materials and methods: The participants were medical students, residents, and fellows who rotated through the Walter Reed Pain Clinic. All participants attended a 1-h virtual workshop via an online platform focused on empathy. The workshop was composed of preparatory reading materials, a simulation video, and a case discussion led by three facilitators. This workshop occurred once a month and each rotation included a different set of attendees. A total of 13 monthly seminars were run from May 2023 to August 2024. The impact of this activity was measured with a series of three surveys, which asked learners to directly assess the efficacy of the workshop and to self-evaluate their competencies in key areas. There was a pre-workshop survey to establish a baseline for participants' empathy self-assessments, an immediate post-workshop survey with an aim to measure the perceived quality of the curriculum, and a 1-month check-in designed to measure if the workshop improved participants' self-assessed empathy skills.

Results: The primary outcome was the change in participants' self-assessed empathy 1 month after the workshop. Data from the 1-month follow up demonstrate that there was significant improvement in self-assessments of empathy by learners after the workshop. The secondary outcome was the participant analysis of the workshop curriculum. A total of 94% of participants indicated they would recommend the workshop to their colleagues. In all, 76% of participants indicated they will be changing the way they practice because of the workshop. In all, 31% of participants reported one or more actionable empathetic behaviors they plan to work on as a direct result of the workshop.",https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image-v2.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-19 14:56:34.125142

Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.

There's been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that's slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.

In Trump’s first term, his properties in New York, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.

“Tesla is an easy target,” said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. “They’re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.”

Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.

But the attacks are keeping law enforcement busy.

Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a building.

And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.

“The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,” the agent wrote.

Some of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.

An Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.

Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.

In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word “resist” was also painted in red across the building’s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails — crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid — and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.

“Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think — the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,” Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. “None of those factors are lost on us.”

Tesla becomes a target for the left

Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn’t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.

More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump’s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.

Musk continues to run Tesla — as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump’s adviser.

Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump’s election but has since shed all those gains.

Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric-vehicle showroom. He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz’s podcast, saying “at least some of it is organized and paid for” by “left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.”

“This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,” Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. “Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.”

The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize “Musk Or Us” protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and “it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.”

Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle’s new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy” or “I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.”

Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla’s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used-car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.

The White House vows a crackdown

The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump's political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to “domestic terror,” and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are “going to go through hell.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi said she’d opened an investigation “to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.”

“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you,” Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she vowed to “continue investigations that impose severe consequences,” including for “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.”

Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.

“It’s not the type of act that I would prioritize,” Clarke said. “Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.”

Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.

“Hate on Elon and Trump all you want — that’s fine and dandy, it’s your choice,” she said. “It doesn’t justify ruining somebody’s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There’s other ways to get your voice heard that’s more effective.”

Someone recently slapped a “no Elon” sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn’t intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/ccbf403b-d60b-4d44-ba14-19a7adc6f1e7/20250319T135235/ccbf403b-d60b-4d44-ba14-19a7adc6f1e7_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-19 16:56:41.377478

Here’s how it works: Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first.
TRICARE pays last, after Medicare and OHI, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.
Travel insurance: If you buy a temporary plan for travel, TRICARE will process your claims only after your travel insurance.
You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts.","MARCH 19, 2025 – Do you or your spouse have health coverage through an employer? Or maybe you’ve been shopping for additional coverage due to a change in your health needs.

TRICARE may not be the only health coverage you have. If you have health insurance through an employer, a spouse’s plan, or a private insurer, it’s considered other health insurance.

OHI can affect how TRICARE processes your claim. TRICARE and OHI work together to help cover your health care and services, as described in Chapter 4, Section 1 of the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual.

Understanding how TRICARE coordinates with OHI can help ensure your claims are processed correctly, helping to avoid unexpected costs.

Which insurance pays first?

In most cases, TRICARE pays after your OHI has processed your claim. Here’s how it works:

Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first. After your OHI processes the claim, TRICARE may cover some—or all—of the balance.

Medicare, OHI, and TRICARE For Life:

Whether Medicare or your OHI pays first depends on several factors: whether your OHI is based on current or former employment (and the number of employees), and if you have end-stage renal disease. Medicare only coordinates with one other health plan.

If OHI pays after Medicare, and there is a remaining balance, you’re responsible for filing a claim with TRICARE.

TRICARE pays last, after Medicare and OHI, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

If you have Medicare and have questions about who pays first, or if your coverage changes, call Medicare’s Benefits Coordination and Recovery Center at 855-798-2627 (TTY: 855-797-2627) .

Travel insurance: If you buy a temporary plan for travel, TRICARE will process your claims only after your travel insurance.

There are a few times when TRICARE pays first. This includes when you have:

Medicaid

TRICARE supplemental plans

Eligibility for state victims of crime compensation programs

Other federal government programs identified by the Defense Health Agency

If TRICARE mistakenly pays first when it shouldn’t, it may take back the payment and reprocess your claim after your OHI has processed it.

OHI for active duty service members

Active duty service members can use OHI under certain circumstances. If you use OHI, keep the following in mind:

You’re responsible for all costs.

TRICARE won’t be second payer. There’s no coordination of benefits with your OHI and TRICARE.

You must disclose your military status to your OHI to avoid denials or recoupments.

If you get care from a civilian provider, you must comply with service regulations.

Unauthorized care may affect your fitness for duty status.

What you need to do

To avoid claims processing delays, let your TRICARE contractor and care providers know you have OHI. You can report your OHI by:

Phone: Call your regional TRICARE contractor.

Online: Fill out and submit your contractor’s OHI questionnaire.

Mail or fax: Complete and send your TRICARE contractor OHI questionnaire.

If your OHI coverage changes, notify your TRICARE contractor right away. Losing OHI is a Qualifying Life Event, so you’ll have 90 days to make changes to your plan.

Using OHI with TRICARE pharmacy and dental coverage

Pharmacy benefits: If your OHI includes pharmacy coverage, your OHI will pay first. You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts. For lower costs, use a pharmacy that’s in both your OHI’s network and the TRICARE network.

Dental plans: If you’re enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program or the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, your dental insurance provider will determine the order of payment based on your plan.

Stay informed and notify TRICARE

Properly coordinating your OHI with TRICARE ensures you maximize your benefits and avoid delays in claims processing. If you have OHI:

Tell your TRICARE contractor and healthcare providers about your OHI.

Make sure your claims are submitted in the correct order.

Notify TRICARE if your OHI coverage changes.

Unlock your health by taking these simple steps today. When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.

The recall affects 66 Large Chicken Boxes (84 oz.) and 74 Small Chicken Boxes (21 oz.) with the lot code/best by date of 11152026. The affected products were distributed to retailers in California, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington.

New York City health officials this week urged consumers to avoid Savage Pet products because of the cats' illnesses.

One cat fell ill and died this month after eating the Savage Pet products. Final test results are pending, but a preliminary test for H5N1 was “nonnegative,” which indicates that a certain amount of virus was detected, a department spokesperson said.

A second cat was diagnosed with H5N1 and died — and tests suggested it was infected with a strain related to that found in the recalled Savage Pet food. However, that cat did not eat the food; it was exposed to a third cat that fell ill after eating the food from the implicated lot. That cat survived but was not tested.

The recall is the latest in recent months tied to products potentially contaminated with the virus that has sickened and killed cats in several states.

Earlier this month, Wild Coast Raw, of Olympia, Washington, recalled frozen boneless raw chicken cat food after it was linked to illnesses and deaths in cats in Oregon and Washington. In December, Morasch Meats of Portland, Oregon, recalled its Northwest Naturals brand of raw and frozen turkey pet food after it tested positive for the virus and was linked to the death of a local cat.

Health officials advise cat owners to monitor their pets for symptoms including fever, lethargy, low appetite, eye inflammation, discharge, breathing difficulties, and neurological signs such as tremors or seizures. Seek veterinary care immediately if such symptoms appear.

No human infections have been reported from handling raw pet food products, but health authorities warn that humans can become infected if live virus enters the eyes, nose, or mouth. People who have handled the recalled products should watch for symptoms such as eye irritation, cough, sore throat, fever, and respiratory difficulties.

The recalled products are packaged in cardboard boxes containing individual plastic packets, with the lot code stamped on the bottom of the box and on each packet. Consumers are urged to return the products to their retailer for proper destruction and a full refund.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/af2c5d10-938f-43d9-8483-09957e6a38fd/20250318T210310/af2c5d10-938f-43d9-8483-09957e6a38fd_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-19 15:57:14.065455

Gaza’s Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560.","DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday that killed more than 400 Palestinians, local health officials said, shattering a ceasefire in place since January as it vowed to force Hamas to release more hostages and relinquish control of the territory.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to free half of the remaining hostages as a precondition for extending the ceasefire. Israel’s deadliest bombardment of the territory in the 17-month war killed mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Netanyahu said the attack was “only the beginning” and that Israel would press ahead until it achieves all of its war aims — destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group.

Hamas said at least six senior officials were killed in Tuesday’s strikes. Israel said they included the head of Hamas’ civilian government, a justice ministry official and two security agency chiefs.

All further ceasefire negotiations will take place “under fire,” he said in a statement aired on national television. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel’s actions.

The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza’s 2 million Palestinians.

The pre-dawn barrage across Gaza struck homes and shelters and set a tent camp ablaze as families slept or prepared the “sohour,” the meal Muslims eat before they start the daily fast in the holy month of Ramadan. In Gaza City, Omar Greygaa said that after the strikes, he ran out to help survivors in a nearby stricken building.

“In every room I found the dead. ... I finish in one place and go to another, and I find more dead,” he said. “I don't know if we're in a state of war or truce.”

The attack could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.

A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu’s decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to save his far-right governing coalition.

There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment.

But Yemen’s Houthi rebels fired rockets toward Israel for the first time since the ceasefire began. The volley set off sirens in Israel’s southern Negev desert but was intercepted before it reached the country’s territory, the military said. The U.S. over the weekend launched deadly strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis.

Israel’s return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial was canceled after the strikes.

The strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost. A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announced Tuesday it was rejoining.

The main group representing families of the hostages accused the government of “deliberately dismantling” the ceasefire. Thousands of Israelis packed a Tel Aviv square Tuesday evening to protest Netanyahu’s intention to fire the country’s domestic security chief and demand the government to resume negotiations for a hostage deal.

“Today Netanyahu did not open the gates of hell on Hamas. He opened the gates of hell on our loved ones,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son is among the hostages.

After two months of relative calm during the ceasefire, stunned Palestinians found themselves once again digging loved ones out of rubble and holding funeral prayers over the dead at hospital morgues.

“Nobody wants to fight,” Nidal Alzaanin, a resident of Gaza City, said. “Everyone is still suffering from the previous months.”

A hit on a home in Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. Another in Gaza City killed 27 members of a family, half of them women and children, including a 1-year-old, according to a list of the dead put out by Palestinian medics.

By noon on Tuesday, Nasser Hospital had received the bodies of at least 28 children killed in recent violence, according to records shared by Ahmed Al-Farra, head of pediatrics and obstetrics.

At Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital, patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Wounded children overwhelmed the pediatric ward, said Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group.

She said she helped treat a 6-year-old girl with internal bleeding. When they pulled away her curly hair, they realized shrapnel had also penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her paralyzed on the right side. She was brought in with no ID, and “we don’t know if her family survived,” Haj-Hassan said.

Gaza’s Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry’s records department, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children under 18. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war.

In his statement Tuesday, Netanyahu blamed Hamas for civilian casualties, saying it operates among the population.

The war has killed over 48,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. The Health Ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.

The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.

The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”

The ceasefire deal that the U.S. helped broker, however, did not require Hamas to release more hostages to extend the halt in fighting beyond its first phase.

An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas’ military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks.

The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Hamas on Tuesday denied planning new attacks.

Under the ceasefire that began in mid-January, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.

But Israel balked at entering negotiations over a second phase. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the freeing of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives.

Instead, Israel demanded Hamas release half of the remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire extension and a vague promise to eventually negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas refused, demanding the two sides follow the original deal, which called for the halt in fighting to continue during negotiations over the second phase.

Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas’ governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible.

A full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/c393859d-1fbf-4225-a3b6-782f2371486e/20250318T112728/c393859d-1fbf-4225-a3b6-782f2371486e_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-19 12:57:01.221766

After a confusing weekend, the Department of Veterans Affairs has confirmed that they will no longer offer treatment for gender dysphoria to veterans who aren’t already receiving gender-affirming care through the department.

It’s been a difficult year for trans service members and their families. One of former president Joe Biden’s final acts in office was to sign a National Defense Authorization Act that denied coverage for gender-affirming care through TRICARE, service members’ primary healthcare insurance provider, the first federally enacted anti-LGBTQ+ law since the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.

Then, immediately after taking office and during a whirlwind of anti-trans executive orders being issued, Trump declared that transgender Americans would no longer be allowed to serve in the military. Early this month, the Pentagon issued new directives to identify and fire service members who have, or have a history of, gender dysphoria starting next month. The blatantly discriminatory firing of more than 15,000 service members, many of whom likely occupy key positions in the hierarchy of the United States military, will certainly destabilize an armed forces that’s already struggling to meet recruitment quotas.

Whether or not you see that as a silver lining, it’s hard to celebrate more than 15,000 unemployed transgender people. That ban is currently blocked by a federal court order, but it remains to be seen if the Trump administration and the Department of Defense will obey the courts.

Now, after previously denying a change in policy, the VA has confirmed that they will no longer be treating new patients for gender dysphoria. They are rescinding Directive 1341, which provided detailed guidance for the kinds of care veterans can receive at a VA facility, and refusing to provide gender-affirming care for any veterans who aren’t already receiving treatment for gender dysphoria.

VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a press release on Monday, “I mean no disrespect to anyone, but VA should not be focused on helping Veterans attempt to change their sex. The vast majority of Veterans and Americans agree, and that is why this is the right decision … [if] veterans want to attempt to change their sex, they can do so on their own dime.”

This seems especially buffoonish coming from the organization that, need I remind you all, spends tens of millions of dollars annually on dick pills for troops. Not that I have anything against the concept of providing truly gluttonous amounts of Viagra for our fighting men and women… or whatever… but it just seems a tad hypocritical, considering trans troops and veterans cost the government barely a fraction of the money they spend on those dick pills.

The VA assures that non-GAC healthcare for LGBTQ+ veterans won’t be affected by these changes, but that’s cold comfort for the people who sacrificed years of their lives to earn lifetime care from the fed, only to be told now that they can’t be treated for a specific disorder—their doctors told that they cannot practice certain kinds of medicine and provide appropriate treatment to their patients—because of an ongoing culture war between the fascists in power and a minority group that constitutes maybe one percent of the entire national populace. To say nothing of the fact that LGBTQ+ veterans have a higher rate of suicide than the general veteran population, which is already higher than that of the civilian population.

I would advise trans veterans to prepare for the goal posts to be moved even further in the coming days.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/633303d5ccf756402b93f25c/t/67da4246834e1b4e4537e4f9/1742357062503/va-1024x708.jpg?format=1500w,N,0.0,2025-03-19 06:56:27.296932

As a retired military family who has had personal experience with U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans’ constituent services, I read with interest the letter of Mr. Charles W. Robinson (“Kiggans fails constituents,” March 12).

We had a serious coverage issue arise involving Tricare (Humana Military) regarding our dependent adult child. We initially went through Tricare in a futile attempt to resolve the issue: an issue where we had recorded evidence they were in the wrong. We were told by their representatives, basically, that they don’t correct these types of errors, sorry, you’re on the hook. This error was going to leave our adult dependent on the hook for over $100,000 in charges. This dependent has a chronic disease and medical expenses add up every year. It looked hopeless.

I then decided to contact Rep. Kiggans’ constituent office to see if there was anything they could do to help us with this federal agency. Her constituent services put in a congressional inquiry to Tricare. It was that congressional inquiry that got the ball rolling. It was a matter of a couple of days that our child had a representative from Tricare assigned to her case to work through the issue. We never received a response to our submitted paperwork via the Tricare system to dispute the charges. It was only due to the work of Rep. Kiggans’ office that anything was done on our behalf.

To say Rep. Kiggans and her staff fail her constituents is disingenuous. Her office saved our family over $100,000 in potential medical bills. Her office came through when, if we’d just stuck with what Tricare was telling us, we’d be looking at paying back a lot of medical debt that was their error.

Regarding the other issues Mr. Robinson brought up in his letter, Rep. Kiggans addresses these issues via her social media. Maybe Mr. Robinson doesn’t follow Rep. Kiggans on the various social media platforms or isn’t signed up for her newsletter.

We are one retired military family that is grateful for Rep. Kiggans and the work her office has done and continues to do on our behalf.

“The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said.
As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role in delivering health care to service members, civilians, and their families stationed at U.S.
Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.","GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba – Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, visited U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay to engage with leadership and staff on Feb. 27, 2025.

Ferrara’s visit underscores his commitment to engaging with medical personnel at military hospitals and clinics across the Military Health System to better understand their challenges and ensure they have the resources necessary to provide exceptional care.

As the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS.

“There is no substitute for boots-on-the-ground to understand the nature and complexity of any mission, especially one this complex,” Ferrara said. “I wanted to ensure the team was receiving the support they need to execute their mission successfully. U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo is a particularly vital military hospital in a remote location with a unique mission set, so seeing both the daily operations and unique operations like the joint expeditionary MEDEVAC training was invaluable for understanding the hospital's specific needs and how I can best support their critical work from my position. As the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I have a unique responsibility for detainee care, making it important that I gain a firsthand understanding of that unique mission.”

Managing a geographically remote military hospital comes with challenges in manning and occasionally supply chain procurement. Hospital Director U.S. Navy Capt. Tammy Servies, who also serves as commanding officer for U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command and commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo’s Joint Medical Group, doesn’t let that impede the mission with her focus on a ready medical force and a medically ready force.

“We were very excited to welcome Dr. Ferrara to Guantanamo,” Servies said. “We provide care to a diverse community, including service members, their dependents, government civilian employees, contractors, and foreign national workers. It was very gratifying to show Dr. Ferrara that no matter who walks through our doors, we are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable health care. Our mission is rooted in operational readiness and wellness, ensuring that those we serve receive the best possible care.

“The health, wellness, and readiness of every service member I lead as the CO of USNMRTC Guantanamo, matters to me personally,” Servies continued. “My team cannot adequately care for others if they are not healthy themselves.”

During his visit, Ferrara met with a cross-section of sailors from every department within the hospital to speak with them and listen to what matters to the most junior members of the hospital team.

“The dedication and resilience of the entire medical staff left a lasting impression on me,” Ferrara said. “It's one thing to hear about the demands of operating in a remote location, but witnessing the team's unwavering commitment to providing top-notch care across a range of disparate environments was truly inspiring.”

Servies echoed the significance of Ferrara’s visit, emphasizing the impact of leadership engagement in understanding the realities of providing health care in a remote setting.

“Despite the challenges we face, my team never fails to amaze me with their willingness to take on every mission that comes our way,” Servies said. “Whether providing support to Joint Task Force Guantanamo, Joint Task Force Southern Guard, or managing the daily operations and patient load from our local community, these military and civilian personnel show an indomitable spirit and mental toughness that sometimes leaves me in awe.”

Ferrara’s visit highlights the ongoing efforts to strengthen military health care delivery and support the dedicated medical personnel who stand ready to serve whenever and wherever they are needed.

“The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said. “The team's ability to maintain a constant state of readiness, adapt to diverse needs, and seamlessly collaborate with other units is a testament to their professionalism and commitment to excellence. The isolation of Guantanamo Bay is also easy to underestimate until walking the spaces. The team here has a mission like no other in the Military Health System.”

The Defense Health Agency manages military hospitals and clinics across the Department of Defense, integrating health care services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations.

“Being proactive about one’s oral health is right in line with the well-known medical saying ‘an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,’” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency. “Understanding the link between proactive dental care and preventing future health problems is crucial.”

Confidence is good for your health!

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there’s growing evidence that when patients have something called “higher activation,” or the confidence to become actively engaged in their own healthcare, they have far better health outcomes than those patients who aren’t feeling empowered to take control of their health.

Ultimately, by taking charge, you’re not just ensuring better care--you’re actively participating in your oral health and understanding your benefits.

How to prepare for going to the dentist

Prepare a list of questions. Before your appointment, prepare a list of questions. Ask about preventive measures specific to your needs, like the best flossing technique for your teeth or the ideal frequency of cleanings based on your risk factors.

Don’t hesitate to ask questions. During your appointment, ask clarifying questions about procedures if you’re feeling unsure, discuss the pros and cons of different treatment options, and inquire about potential risks and side effects. If a procedure is suggested, ask about alternative methods, the cost associated with each, and whether your insurance covers the procedure.

Be clear and direct. At any time during the appointment, be clear and direct in expressing any discomfort or concerns. Don't suffer in silence. If a procedure is painful or uncomfortable, inform your dentist immediately. They can adjust their technique or provide pain relief.

Use active listening. Make sure you understand what your dentist is saying about your diagnosis, treatment plan, and aftercare instructions. You can repeat the information back to your dentist to ensure you’ve understood correctly.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/18/2003669042/1920/1080/0/250318-O-D0202-1001.JPG,N,1.0,2025-03-18 16:56:32.090496

For the past two weeks, a handful of celebrities have stepped up to guest host episodes of ""The Kelly Clarkson Show.""
Questions about Clarkson's absence started on March 3, when actor Simu Liu seemingly took on hosting duties at the last-minute.
""I am not Kelly Clarkson.
""The Kelly Clarkson Show"" is currently in its sixth season and has already been renewed for a seventh.","WASHINGTON — Kelly Clarkson finally made her return as host to her daytime talk show on Tuesday after a weekslong absence.

Clarkson opened up the episode with a ""Kellyoke,"" where she sang ""Flames"" by New Zealand artist Will Swenson. Soon after wrapping the song, the music star jumped right into interviewing ""Severance"" actor Adam Scott.

The 42-year-old singer did not publicly address her absence from the show's past several episodes. Reports surfaced last week that the ""American Idol"" winner was fine herself but was ""dealing with a personal matter.""

Fans awaited Clarkson's expected return Tuesday after the daytime talk show revealed this week's TV schedule. If the schedule stays true, Clarkson will be out again for Wednesday's show and will return on Thursday and Friday.

""Watch What Happens Live"" host Andy Cohen will take the helm on Wednesday, according to the schedule.

For the past two weeks, a handful of celebrities have stepped up to guest host episodes of ""The Kelly Clarkson Show.""

According to Entertainment Tonight, a source said Clarkson's absence was due to a ""sudden family emergency"" and she missed a total of 10 tapings of her talk show. With nine of those already aired, Wednesday's episode would be the last one she missed.

ET reported Clarkson was back in her studio Thursday to tape a new episode and will host the show's 1,000th episode set to air this week.

Questions about Clarkson's absence started on March 3, when actor Simu Liu seemingly took on hosting duties at the last-minute.

""I am not Kelly Clarkson. I know this may shock many of you,"" Liu quipped at the top of the show. ""But Kelly actually isn't able to make it today, we're sending her our very best.""

""Here's the thing, I did not know that I was doing this until about five minutes ago when I arrived here to promote my new movie, 'Last Breath,' which is in theaters right now,"" Liu explained.

According to the Entertainment Tonight report, guests were not told in advance that Clarkson would be out due to privacy reasons and were given the option to guest host when they arrived at the studio.

While Clarkson hosted the episodes that aired on Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, comedian Roy Wood Jr. guest hosted on Thursday and Wanda Sykes was there on Friday.

You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts.
When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.","FALLS CHURCH, Va. – Do you or your spouse have health coverage through an employer? Or maybe you’ve been shopping for additional coverage due to a change in your health needs.

TRICARE may not be the only health coverage you have. If you have health insurance through an employer, a spouse’s plan, or a private insurer, it’s considered other health insurance.

OHI can affect how TRICARE processes your claim. TRICARE and OHI work together to help cover your health care and services, as described in Chapter 4, Section 1 of the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual.

Understanding how TRICARE coordinates with OHI can help ensure your claims are processed correctly, helping to avoid unexpected costs.

Which insurance pays first?

In most cases, TRICARE pays after your OHI has processed your claim. Here’s how it works:

• Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first. After your OHI processes the claim, TRICARE may cover some—or all—of the balance.

• Medicare, OHI, and TRICARE For Life:

• Whether Medicare or your OHI pays first depends on several factors: whether your OHI is based on current or former employment (and the number of employees), and if you have end-stage renal disease. Medicare only coordinates with one other health plan.

• If OHI pays after Medicare, and there is a remaining balance, you’re responsible for filing a claim with TRICARE.

• TRICARE pays last, after Medicare and OHI, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

• If you have Medicare and have questions about who pays first, or if your coverage changes, call Medicare’s Benefits Coordination and Recovery Center at 855-798-2627 (TTY: 855-797-2627) .

• Travel insurance: If you buy a temporary plan for travel, TRICARE will process your claims only after your travel insurance.

There are a few times when TRICARE pays first. This includes when you have:

• Medicaid

• TRICARE supplemental plans

• Eligibility for state victims of crime compensation programs

• Other federal government programs identified by the Defense Health Agency

If TRICARE mistakenly pays first when it shouldn’t, it may take back the payment and reprocess your claim after your OHI has processed it.

OHI for active duty service members

Active duty service members can use OHI under certain circumstances. If you use OHI, keep the following in mind:

• You’re responsible for all costs.

• TRICARE won’t be second payer. There’s no coordination of benefits with your OHI and TRICARE.

• You must disclose your military status to your OHI to avoid denials or recoupments.

• If you get care from a civilian provider, you must comply with service regulations.

• Unauthorized care may affect your fitness for duty status.

What you need to do

To avoid claims processing delays, let your TRICARE contractor and care providers know you have OHI. You can report your OHI by:

• Phone: Call your regional TRICARE contractor.

• Online: Fill out and submit your contractor’s OHI questionnaire.

• Mail or fax: Complete and send your TRICARE contractor OHI questionnaire.

If your OHI coverage changes, notify your TRICARE contractor right away. Losing OHI is a Qualifying Life Event, so you’ll have 90 days to make changes to your plan.

Using OHI with TRICARE pharmacy and dental coverage

• Pharmacy benefits: If your OHI includes pharmacy coverage, your OHI will pay first. You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts. For lower costs, use a pharmacy that’s in both your OHI’s network and the TRICARE network.

• Dental plans: If you’re enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program or the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, your dental insurance provider will determine the order of payment based on your plan.

Stay informed and notify TRICARE

Properly coordinating your OHI with TRICARE ensures you maximize your benefits and avoid delays in claims processing. If you have OHI:

• Tell your TRICARE contractor and healthcare providers about your OHI.

• Make sure your claims are submitted in the correct order.

• Notify TRICARE if your OHI coverage changes.

Unlock your health by taking these simple steps today. When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.

Fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri, from South America have recently colonized three continents. Prevalence of fire ant-venom anaphylaxis in the general population and in systemic mastocytosis is unknown. The aim was to determine fire ant-venom anaphylaxis prevalence among Tricare beneficiaries and those with systemic mastocytosis.Methods: We queried the beneficiary immunotherapy prescription database for patients who received immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venom or fire ant whole-body extract and the Tricare beneficiary population health registry database for patients with an ICD-10 code for Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA). Greater than 95% of the beneficiary population were patients living in the United States. Chart review of a random sample of 150 patients linked to a HVA ICD-10 code was performed to determine the percent of patients with Hymenoptera-venom anaphylaxis. Retrospective review of a systemic mastocytosis cohort was performed to assess fire ant-venom anaphylaxis rate and treatment patterns.Results: Fire ant immunotherapy was the most frequently ordered individual immunotherapy prescription 45.9% (n=878). Fire ant prescriptions surpassed all flying Hymenoptera immunotherapy prescriptions combined in six states. Fire ant and flying Hymenoptera-venom anaphylaxis prevalence in the general population was 0.048% and 0.083%, respectively. Fire ant-venom anaphylaxis prevalence in the 14 colonized states was 0.085%. More patients with systemic mastocytosis had anaphylaxis triggered by fire ant than all Hymenoptera combined.

I am an in network credentialed provider for Tricare and yet some clients randomly show me as out of network and their EOB erroneously reflects this as more financial responsibility for the client.

Your provider needs to contact Tricare and resubmit the claim. And yes, balance billing (asking a client for more than negotiated rate) is not right. But if the provider has a billing service this may just be an automated response to the internal errors. It’s a huge issue with many providers not getting paid by Tricare since 12/2024.

I would contact Tricare right away and ask them about it. When I had my kids (granted, this was ages ago), the hospital I went to tried balance billing, which they weren’t allowed to do. I had to have Tricare write them a cease and desist twice. It’s not deductible. They wouldn’t make you pay the entire thing at once (though I have select, so Idk if it’s different in that, but I doubt it). I would call before the bill is due and then have Tricare verify and then contact the provider. I know I didn’t have to do anything beyond that, but you may want to cover yourself and just tell them you contacted Tricare, who will be contacting them about it.

Good luck.

I use a nurse practitioner for my primary care provider. He is also apparently listed as an allergy specialist. On a visit last year he billed as a specialist which has a higher copay. I contacted the billing office to find out what was going on and they wrote off the entire copay.

Now my copay shows before I even see him and I go ahead and pay that online, then I don't pay anything else until I get the EOB and I only pay what Tricare says I owe. (Tricare select)",,N,-1.0,2025-03-18 12:59:54.925680

Camden, NJ — Two former executives of a Louisiana compounding pharmacy were found guilty of conspiring to use the pharmacy to defraud New Jersey and military health benefits programs of approximately $100 million, conspiring to commit identity theft in connection with the fraud, and conspiring to transact in the criminal proceeds, U.S. Attorney John Giordano announced.

Christopher Kyle Johnston of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Trent Brockmeier of The Villages, Florida, were convicted on March 10, 2025 of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of conspiring to commit identity theft by fraudulently using a means of identification, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering by transacting in criminal proceeds following a six-week trial before U.S. District Judge Edward S. Kiel.

According to documents filed in this case and the evidence at trial:

Central Rexall Drugs was a pharmacy in Louisiana that prepared compounded medications, which are specialty medications mixed by a pharmacist to meet the specific medical needs of an individual patient. In 2013, Johnston and Brockmeier entered into an agreement to take over the management of the pharmacy and expand the compounding business in exchange for 90 percent of the profits. Brockmeier became chief operating officer of Central Rexall and Johnston became general counsel.

Johnston and Brockmeier learned that certain insurance plans would reimburse thousands of dollars for a one-month supply of certain compounded medications – including pain, scar, and antifungal creams, as well as vitamin combinations. The health plans for New Jersey state and local government and education employees, including teachers, firefighters, municipal police officers, and state troopers, covered these medications, as did TRICARE, which insures current and former members of the U.S. military and their families.

Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications and manipulated the ingredients in the medications in order to obtain high insurance reimbursements rather than serve the medical needs of patients. To determine which ingredients and combinations resulted in high insurance reimbursements, Johnston and Brockmeier directed Central Rexall employees to submit false prescription claims to test out different combinations of ingredients, but they did not have a valid prescription signed by a doctor for these formulas. Central Rexall submitted these false claims using, without their consent, individuals’ names, dates of birth, and identifying information (including insurance information) from pre-existing Central Rexall prescriptions.

By use of these false claims, Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications with combinations of ingredients that were chosen solely based on the amount of money that insurance would pay rather than on the medications’ ability to serve the medical needs of patients.

Johnston and Brockmeier retained and directed an outside sales force that used various methods to get doctors to prescribe these medications and patients to accept them, including having prescriptions signed without the patient seeing a doctor or knowing about the medications, having medications or refills ordered without the patients’ knowledge, paying patients to accept the medications, and paying doctors to prescribe them.

Johnston and Brockmeier caused approximately $100 million in fraudulent insurance claims for compounded medications that were not medically necessary. Johnston received approximately $34 million and Brockmeier received approximately $5 million in illicit profits.

50 people have been convicted or pled guilty in the overarching conspiracy.

The health care fraud and wire fraud conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit identity theft count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit money laundering charge carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense or not more than twice the amount of the criminally derived property involved in the transactions. Sentencing is scheduled for July 21, 2025.

Reilly in Newark; and the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to today’s conviction.

A total of 148 active-duty service members (SMs) were recruited for this randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were randomly assigned to either the SMART (n=80) or SCORE (n=68) intervention arms. Outcome measures were administered at the start (T1) and end of treatment (T2), and at 3 months post-treatment (T3). The primary outcome measure was the Global Deficit Scale (GDS), a composite of seven different objective measures of cognitive performance. Secondarily, participants completed the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) and Key Behavioral Change Index (KBCI) self-report measures of post concussive symptoms (PCS). A cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed directly comparing the relative efficiencies of the two CR interventions.

TRICARE Select is a fee-for-service health plan available to eligible members of the military community, including active-duty family members, retired service members, and their families.

Unlike TRICARE Prime which is a managed care model, TRICARE Select allows beneficiaries to choose their healthcare providers without referrals. This flexibility can be helpful when choosing a rehab center that meets your needs. TRICARE insurance has several plans, including TRICARE Select, each with different benefits and coverage options.

When choosing a rehab facility it’s important to know the different types of treatment centers TRICARE Select covers. These include:

1. Inpatient Rehab Centers

Inpatient treatment or residential rehab centers provide intensive, around-the-clock care in a structured environment. These programs are best for individuals with severe addictions who need medical supervision and support. TRICARE Select typically covers inpatient stays but pre-authorization may be required.

2. Outpatient Rehab Centers

Outpatient treatment allows you to receive care while living at home, making it a good option for those with mild to moderate substance use disorders. Services may include individual and group therapy, medication management, and relapse prevention planning.

TRICARE Select covers both inpatient and outpatient rehab services, so flexibility is based on the severity of the addiction.

3. Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs)

PHPs provide a high level of care without full-time residential treatment. Patients attend treatment for several hours a day and return home in the evenings. TRICARE Select often covers PHPs as an alternative to inpatient rehab.

4. Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs)

IOPs offer a structured treatment approach with multiple therapy sessions a week but more flexibility than inpatient or PHP treatment. These programs are good for individuals transitioning from a higher level of care or those with moderate addiction concerns.

5. Detox Centers

Medically supervised detox for alcohol and drugs is the first step in addiction recovery, especially for substances that cause severe withdrawal symptoms.

TRICARE Select may cover detox services if they are done at a TRICARE-authorized facility.

1. Verify TRICARE Authorization

Authorized facilities meet the necessary standards for quality care and accept TRICARE coverage. To make sure the rehab center is TRICARE authorized, speak with a TRICARE Rehabs representative. We can help you find a TRICARE-approved facility that is covered under your plan.

2. Understand Costs and Coverage Limits

While TRICARE Select covers many rehab services, you may still have out-of-pocket costs such as copayments or cost-shares. Be sure to confirm financial responsibilities before starting treatment.

3. Consider Location and Specialization

Choose a facility that meets your needs. Some centers specialize in treating veterans while others offer dual diagnosis treatment for co-occurring mental health disorders.

4. Get Recommendations

Talk to a TRICARE Rehabs representative to get guidance on choosing the right rehab center to get treatment. We are experts on military-specific addiction treatment, and work with an extensive network of veterans rehab facilities across the nation that cater military members and their families.

What to Expect in a TRICARE Select Rehab Program

The rehab experience varies based on the level of care and individual needs but most programs follow a structured treatment plan that includes:

1. Assessment and Intake

A comprehensive evaluation to determine the best treatment plan. This may include medical assessments, psychological evaluations, and substance use history.

2. Detox (if needed)

Medically supervised detox to ensure a safe withdrawal process and prepare individuals for the next phase of treatment.

3. Therapy and Counseling

Evidence-based therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and trauma-informed care are often included in treatment plans. This is due to how common mental health issues are amongst military personnel and veterans.

4. Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)

For those struggling with opioid or alcohol addiction, MAT may be prescribed to ease withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.

5. Aftercare and Relapse Prevention

Successful recovery from drug and alcohol addiction requires ongoing support such as 12-step programs, outpatient therapy, and sober living arrangements.

Getting treatment for substance use disorder is a big step and TRICARE Select health insurance makes it available to military families. Knowing the coverage, choosing the right rehab and committing to the process can mean a healthier, addiction free life.

TRICARE offers several health insurance options for retired service members and their eligible family members. Understanding these options is key to making the best choices for your healthcare needs during retirement.

Who’s Eligible?

If you’re a retired service member, you’re eligible for TRICARE benefits if you fall into one of these categories:

You retired from active duty.

You retired from the National Guard or Reserve (beginning at age 60 or earlier if drawing retirement pay due to specific service credits).

You’re placed on the Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL) or Permanent Disability Retirement List (PDRL).

You’re receiving retired pay, even if it’s due to a medical retirement.

Eligible Family Members Include:

Spouses

Unmarried children (up to age 21, or 23 if enrolled in college full time)

Adult children with disabilities that occurred before age 21 (or 23 if in college)

TRICARE Plan Options for Retirees

Once you retire, your TRICARE options change from what you had on active duty. Here’s a breakdown of the available plans:

1. TRICARE Prime

Who Can Enroll: Retired service members and eligible family members in Prime Service Areas (PSAs) in the U.S.

Cost: Enrollment fees apply, and there may be copayments for certain services.

How It Works: You have a Primary Care Manager (PCM) who coordinates your care and referrals. It’s similar to an HMO. If your family was enrolled in TRICARE Prime during active service, or you were a service member receiving care at a Military Treatment Facility (MTF), this is the same process.

2. TRICARE Select

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and families worldwide (where TRICARE Select is offered).

Cost: Annual enrollment fees and cost-shares (percentage of covered services you pay). No referrals needed, but some services require prior authorization.

How It Works: You manage your own health care. You can see any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral.

3. TRICARE For Life (TFL)

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and their family members who are eligible for Medicare Part A and have Medicare Part B.

Cost: No enrollment fee, but you must pay for Medicare Part B. TFL acts as a secondary payer to Medicare.

How It Works: Available worldwide. Medicare pays first in the U.S., and TFL pays what’s left. Outside the U.S., TFL is the primary payer.

4. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) / TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR)

TRS: For actively serving National Guard/Reserve members (not retirees).

TRR: For “gray area” retirees—those under age 60 not yet drawing retired pay. It’s a premium-based plan.

5. US Family Health Plan (USFHP)

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and family members under age 65 in specific areas of the U.S.

Cost: Enrollment fees and copayments, similar to TRICARE Prime.

How It Works: Care is provided by a network of private providers. Once you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, you can no longer stay in this plan.

Dental and Vision Coverage

TRICARE Dental Program (TDP)

Not available to retirees.

Retirees can enroll in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) for dental coverage.

Vision Coverage

Retirees enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can also get vision coverage through FEDVIP.

What Changes at Age 65?

At age 65, you typically become eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B, and TRICARE For Life becomes your primary TRICARE coverage. You must enroll in Medicare Part B to keep TRICARE coverage.

Key Takeaways

Enrollment Fees & Costs: Retirees pay enrollment fees and cost-shares, unlike active-duty members. These fees change annually.

Open Season: Annual TRICARE Open Season runs from mid-November to mid-December, allowing you to enroll in or switch plans.

Visit TRICARE’s Retired Service Members and Their Families page for up-to-date information, resources, and to check your eligibility or enrollment status.
