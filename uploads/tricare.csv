Introduction

U.S. military service members, retirees, and their dependents deserve the highest quality of health care for their service and support to the nation. Whether they are seeking care for pregnancy, service-related injuries, or Individual Medical Readiness (IMR)ii requirements, there should never be a delay in care like those experienced in recent years. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has a responsibility to serve and protect the health of all beneficiaries, and the use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) should be seamless so that patients can visit any military medical facility to receive the treatment they need. When EHR failure occurs due to server issues, cyber-attacks, or other communication infrastructure breakdowns, patient safety is the primary concern for medical providers who are unable to access and update their patient’s medical history and unable to fill vital tests and prescriptions. Each healthcare data breach costs approximately $10 million which is double the cost of some other industries, making healthcare infrastructure a priority target to hackers.iii Protections and redundancy are needed to prevent single-point vulnerabilities to EHRs so the millions of beneficiaries can access the healthcare they are entitled to by their military service.

Military Health System

The Military Health System (MHS) Genesis is the newest iteration of DHA’s EHR system. The primary function and purpose of MHS is to support the servicemember and beneficiaries through the medical readiness missions of each branch of service to ensure a “fit to fight” force and to prepare for them for deployment.iv But it’s more than just warfighter readiness, it is also in-patient hospital stays, surgery, general family medicine, humanitarian assistance, and medical research to name a few. Only 14% of the 9.5 million beneficiaries are active-duty service members; the remaining 86% fall into categories of dependents of active-duty members, retirees and their dependents, and reserve component members and their dependents.v

The DHA’s budget is passed by the annual Defense Appropriations Bill and accounts for various costs to include personnel costs, construction, and Veterans Affairs (VA) related hospital funding through the Unified Medical Budget.vi The FY2025 request for funding through Congress was $61.3 billion, which is only ~7% of the Department of Defense’s (DOD) total budget.vii A portion of the budget goes to private healthcare company costs, such as co-pay costs when outsourced patients visit a non-Military Treatment Facility (MTF).viii However, one of DHA’s goals is to attract military beneficiaries to their local MTF for care instead of outsourcing to private health companies which is being done by increasing recruitment and retention of medical providers and capacity of patients able to be seen at a local MTF on a daily basis.ix As of 2023, there were a total of 736 MTFs, 135 of which were located outside the continental U.S.x

MHS Genesis EHR provides real-time patient medical history for providers to quickly review and update records during and after patient visits. These records are also available to the patient at home through the patient portal system which allows a review of doctor’s notes, see upcoming and previous appointments, schedule appointments and review prescriptions and vaccination history.xi Although EHRs improve access to care, quality of care, and is more cost-effective and efficient than paper copies or legacy systems of medical records, there are ethical and security considerations that must be realized and overcome to secure patient privacy and ensure patient safety.xii Loss or degradation in communication interfaces, such as the server lag providing the data to the consumer (patients and medical providers), can disrupt treatment facility productivity and cause financial loss, but more importantly it can impact quality of care and risk endangering patients due to the inability to access critical medical records.xiii

Outages and Effects

Over the past three years there have been several substantial outages to the MHS network that provides access to EHRs of TRICARE beneficiaries; TRICARE is the government-managed health insurance program for military beneficiaries and is managed by DHA. In 2022, a three-hour outage at 66 DOD sites, 109 Coast Guard sites and 3 VA sites prevented healthcare providers from accessing over 95,000 EHRs.xiv During the outage, the providers were unable to view MHS Genesis records and only able to access the outdated legacy EHR data, which at the time was the redundant mechanism in case of failure of MHS Genesis, preventing prescription fills, record updates, and referrals.xv The outage in 2022 was caused by a “bug” in the EHR software; the software is maintained by Oracle’s Federal EHR database and was developed by Cerner and Leidos Partnership for Defense Healthxvi and fortunately no patients were harmed by this outage.xvii

In 2023, two back-to-back outages of the same Oracle database occurred over an eight day period at five MTFs in which providers were unable to access EHRs due to a failed background process that normally would compensate through other, back-up databases but were not able to do so for unknown reasons; the entire database cluster had to be restarted, and recovery took a total of almost four hours.xviii

At the beginning of 2024, two MTFs located in Japan and one in Alaska experienced MHS Genesis EHR outages just three months after rolling out the program.xix The first outage was reportedly due to human error where all DHA systems that allowed patients to schedule appointments and laboratory tests online as well as communicate with their patient care team were deliberately disabled.xx According to a DHA representative, because the scheduling personnel at the MTFs were overwhelmed with the amount of beneficiaries who mistakenly scheduled appointments for a different MTF or with an incorrect provider, the patient portal function for self-scheduling in MHS Genesis was not available for 4.5 hours, causing more chaos for providers and patients than intended.xxi The alternative to this type of error or systems outages is for patients to call the MTF appointment phone line which many people prefer and trust as more reliable.xxii The second outage, which occurred within the same week, was due to a cyber-attack that not only affected beneficiaries in the Indo-Pacific region, but worldwide.xxiii The cyber-attack was on Change Healthcare, the nation’s largest commercial prescription processing company and used by all DOD MTFs as well as other pharmacies, and the attack left all U.S. military pharmacies unable to fill prescriptions that were not recently put into the system awaiting pick-up.xxiv The cyber-attack attributed to a Blackcat ransomware lasted over a week but costed Change Healthcare over $22 million and prevented new prescriptions from being filled for a short period of time.xxv This cyber-attack also slowed prescription filling at MTFs dramatically, creating distress and anger among beneficiaries.xxvi Not being able to fill prescriptions in a timely manner can be the difference between life and death for some patients if they are unable to obtain the medication due to the delay or forgo it due to inconvenience. DHA is not the only institution experiencing these issues, many hospitals across the U.S. have been fending off cyber-attacks for many years. In 2023 for example, a small county hospital for 120,000 rural residents had over 17,000 ransomware cyber-attacks, which dramatically slowed and stopped operations for a period of time.xxvii

In 2025 after another outage of Oracle’s database, VA hospitals decided it was time to create contingency procedures to defend against more extreme patient care disasters such as those experienced in 2020 to 2021 where over 150 patients were harmed due to errors in the new (at the time) EHR software.xxviii Providers that ordered tests or other procedures for patients ended up in an unknown queue that hospital staff did not know existed thus failed to check.xxix The orders were never filled and patients never received follow-up care or phone calls to ensure their healthcare needs were handled adequately and readily; though the specifics on these harm events were not made public, patient harm events can range from failure or delay in treatment, to adverse and preventable events that require additional medical interventions, whether prolonged or temporary.xxx xxxi Although the more recent outage only occurred at a few VA hospitals in the U.S. West and Midwest, the outage lasted for approximately four hours during peak clinic hours and caused a delay for those receiving care.xxxii

Following several cyber issues over the years, many lawmakers have challenged Cerner, Oracle, and the DOD to terminate MHS Genesis, stating complete failures in the system that have caused patient harm and lack of confidence and morale in troops, retirees, disabled veterans, and providers, while potentially wasting tens of billions of dollars in development and implementation.xxxiii When EHR software does not function properly, whether it is due to unscheduled software updates, bugs in the software, or cyber-attacks, the lives of patients are at risk and medical readiness of troops is hindered which does not correspond with the “fit to fight” servicemember readiness narrative the DOD is seeking to sustain. When an active-duty member is required to stay home because their child’s critical prescriptions are not filled, the active-duty member is distracted at best and is unable to perform essential work at worst. When EHRs are dysfunctional, providers are challenged in obtaining appropriate medical records to tract the status of chronic conditions, mitigate negative medication interactions, and refer patients to specialty care to name just a few impacts, all of which results in longer wait times for patients, continuation of persistent health issues, misdiagnosis, and concerning medication interactions. If MHS Genesis and the other companies the MTFs rely on for providing efficient healthcare continue to have vulnerabilities, the servicemembers will not have the health needed to serve the country and fight at a moment’s notice.

Redundancy and Protection

In an environment where one critical infrastructure, such as the Healthcare and Public Health Sector, relies heavily on another sector to function, the results can be devastating when damage or outages occur. Redundancy and protection against cyber-attacks and outages due to software issues need to be in place to prevent a total military healthcare breakdown, patient safety and harm events and chaos amongst servicemembers and beneficiaries. When integrating EHRs into a healthcare facility, hospital administrators have many concerns such as digital proficiency and technology acceptance within their patient care teams, thus cyber-attacks and outages only hinder the productivity and acceptance of onboarding the new systems and the users.xxxiv

Cyber-attacks can lead to data breaches of sensitive and private information and tax fraud or identity theft and can be devastating to the safety of patients who rely on imbedded technology such as insulin pumps or pacemakers; if a hacker were to access a widely and publicly searchable imbedded technology site, it could kill the patient in a matter of seconds.xxxv Trustworthy systems need to be established for healthcare facilities, ones that control and monitor physical and mechanical capabilities and provide the ability to access, manipulate, transmit, store and share resources or data where the data is protected against loss due to unauthorized access or outages.xxxvi

DHA needs to implement security measures and ensure their cyber security vendors are using appropriate tools and technologies that flag vulnerabilities and monitor every asset. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed a healthcare system cybersecurity readiness and response plan that should be utilized by DHA facilities to prevent and prepare for when cyber-attacks and outages occur.xxxvii DHA cybersecurity teams can sign up for real-time federal alerts and guidance for preventing an imminent threat but should also understand the vulnerabilities of each site and have response and recovery plans regularly updated and readily available. Specifically, life safety or life-reliant equipment should be segregated into isolated networks and redundancy on all networks. Offline endpoints, or “Golden Images”, should be implemented where data remains clean and available if the provider’s workstations are affected during an outage.xxxviii A system should be created that allows providers to continue to access critical medical information regardless of a MHS Genesis outage. The cybersecurity system should automatically back up patient data every few minutes into a separate system to prevent loss of data and prevent patient safety disasters. DHA leaders can ensure monitoring protocols are established with their cybersecurity vendor and should be exercising scenarios to better understand and plan for cyber emergencies.1 Each hospital and clinic should have their own Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) to ensure that patient care is minimally disrupted during downtime and communicate with patients and staff early and often to prevent adverse patient safety events.

Conclusion

TRICARE servicemembers and beneficiaries deserve undisrupted access to medical care and DHA needs to do more to protect those who serve or have served our nation, no matter what the capacity. Cybersecurity within DHA facilities needs to be strengthened with a strong COOP and also strong monitoring systems that will allow for medical providers and patients to better understand and plan for downtime in EHRs and prevent patient harm events if outages do occur. More reliable back-up systems need to be established for effective redundancy instead of relying on outdated information from legacy systems. Cybersecurity teams may not be able to tackle all complex software bugs or defend against cyber-attacks from happening on DHA systems, but they can plan and respond to such cyber-attacks in the future with adequate protections in place.

Developed in partnership with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the CDFM-H demonstrates advanced knowledge and strategic leadership in managing financial operations in defense healthcare environments. It goes beyond the core CDFM by validating critical competencies specific to healthcare financial management.

This specialty certification is designed for leaders and professionals who work in or support the Military Health System (MHS), including those at DHA, military treatment facilities (MTFs), as well as those supporting healthcare operations at federal agencies such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others with significant healthcare missions.

The CDFM-H demonstrates critical knowledge across budgeting, strategic planning, oversight, and operational finance specific to the complex landscape of defense healthcare.

“As the defense healthcare enterprise grows in complexity and cost, so too must our capabilities in managing its resources,” said Rich Brady, CEO of SDFM. “The CDFM-H was developed in direct response to this need—to ensure our professionals have the skills and validation necessary to lead with confidence and accountability.”

A Credential Built for the Mission

The CDFM-H addresses a growing demand for agile, well-trained professionals who can navigate the financial challenges unique to the military and veteran healthcare system. It builds on the core competencies of the CDFM certification and affirms a candidate’s ability to lead across four key domains:

· Strategic Planning

· Management Controls

· Operational Tasks

· CFO Leadership

SDFM developed the exam with input from subject matter experts across the Department of Defense and healthcare sectors. The CDFM-H serves as a powerful tool for organizations looking to build a more qualified, mission-ready workforce and for individuals seeking to elevate their careers through specialized credentialing.

Who Should Apply

The CDFM-H is ideal for:

· Financial managers and analysts in DHA, MTFs, VHA, and supporting agencies

· CDFM or Certified Defense Financial Manager – Acquisition (CDFM-A™) holders seeking to demonstrate deeper healthcare finance expertise

· Professionals supporting healthcare operations in the DoD, VA, DHS, or Indian Health Service

· Budget and program analysts supporting the Military Health System

Certification Process

To qualify for the CDFM-H, candidates must already hold the CDFM or CDFM-A certification. The CDFM-H exam includes 90 multiple-choice questions across the four core domains. The pilot version of the exam is cost free and will only be offered to current CDFM and CDFM-A holders beginning May 28, 2025. Once the pilot concludes and the passing standard is established, the CDFM-H will be available year-round through SDFM.

“This certification is a significant inflection point in healthcare finance profession. It’s a strategic investment in the future of our healthcare financial leaders, CDFM-H strengthens the profession, the system, and ultimately, the mission of national security,” said Colonel John W. Lee, Deputy to the Assistant Director of Resources and Personnel, DHA

TRICARE offers robust coverage for military retirees, but relying on it alone may leave you vulnerable to unexpected healthcare costs, especially as you age into Medicare eligibility.

Understanding how TRICARE works with Medicare and knowing when to consider supplemental or alternative options is essential to protecting your health and finances.

TRICARE Isn’t a One-Size-Fits-All Solution After Retirement

If you’re a military retiree or soon-to-be retiree, you already know that TRICARE is one of the most comprehensive healthcare benefits available in the public sector. However, it’s not always the final answer to all your post-service healthcare needs. Especially as you approach age 65, your coverage options shift, and the financial landscape changes.

While TRICARE provides excellent foundational coverage, gaps emerge depending on your age, location, and whether you become Medicare-eligible. Without a proactive plan, you may face higher out-of-pocket costs than you expect.

Understanding TRICARE Eligibility and Coverage Tiers

TRICARE eligibility and costs vary depending on your status:

Retired Service Members Under Age 65: Most retirees qualify for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Medicare-Eligible Retirees (Age 65+): You become eligible for TRICARE For Life (TFL) if you enroll in Medicare Part A and B.

In 2025, the Department of Defense continues to administer TRICARE through regional contractors. Your choice between TRICARE Prime and Select (before age 65) determines your network flexibility and out-of-pocket responsibilities. Once you turn 65, you are required to enroll in Medicare Part B to retain TRICARE coverage under TFL.

TRICARE For Life becomes your secondary payer after Medicare, meaning Medicare pays first and TFL covers the rest—but not always everything.

Medicare and TRICARE: What Happens at Age 65?

Once you reach age 65, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B to maintain TRICARE coverage. At that point, you transition into TRICARE For Life automatically.

In this setup:

Medicare becomes your primary payer.

TRICARE For Life becomes your secondary payer.

This coordination is generally effective, but it has limitations. TFL doesn’t cover routine dental or vision care, long-term care, or hearing aids. Additionally, if you delay Part B enrollment, you risk losing TRICARE coverage altogether.

What TRICARE For Life Covers—And What It Doesn’t

TRICARE For Life generally covers:

Medicare-covered services

Prescription drugs via the TRICARE Pharmacy Program

Inpatient and outpatient care

Skilled nursing facility care (short-term, following hospitalization)

Durable medical equipment

But it doesn’t cover:

Long-term custodial care

Dental and vision care (except under specific military dental plans)

Hearing aids

Acupuncture and chiropractic services not covered by Medicare

If you anticipate needing any of the above services regularly, TRICARE alone may not be enough.

Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs After Retirement

One of the greatest advantages of TRICARE is its low out-of-pocket burden. However, even with TRICARE For Life, you can still encounter these costs:

Medicare Part B premiums, which are mandatory to maintain TFL eligibility. In 2025, the standard Part B premium is $185 per month.

Prescription drug costs, which, while lower than many plans, still exist.

Care received overseas, which may require upfront payment before reimbursement.

Additionally, if you or your spouse is not yet Medicare-eligible while the other is, you may need to navigate a combination of TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime, and employer or marketplace coverage until both reach age 65.

Retired Reservists and the TRICARE Reserve Select Transition

If you retired from the reserves, you’re in a slightly different situation. Prior to age 60, you may be eligible for TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR), which comes with higher premiums than TRICARE Prime or Select.

At age 60, you gain access to the standard TRICARE retiree options, including Prime and Select. At 65, Medicare enrollment triggers TRICARE For Life eligibility.

It’s important not to confuse TRR with TRICARE Prime or Select—the coverage levels and out-of-pocket costs differ significantly.

Dental and Vision Are Not Included

Retired service members often mistakenly believe TRICARE includes comprehensive dental and vision benefits. In reality:

TRICARE covers only limited dental or vision services (and usually only when medically necessary).

FEDVIP (Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program) is available separately to retirees.

You can enroll in FEDVIP during the annual Open Season or after a qualifying life event. This extra coverage may be essential as you age and encounter new dental or vision needs.

When a Supplemental Policy May Make Sense

While TRICARE For Life is excellent secondary coverage, some retirees find value in an additional Medicare Supplement policy or dental/vision plans. However, you cannot use a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) policy with TRICARE For Life—they’re not compatible.

Instead, you may want to:

Explore separate long-term care insurance

Enroll in FEDVIP for dental and vision

Review other insurance options if you plan to live abroad

Choosing supplemental insurance depends heavily on your health status, financial situation, and personal preferences.

Living Overseas? TRICARE Has Limits

TRICARE For Life provides international coverage, but there are caveats:

Medicare doesn’t cover overseas care.

TRICARE becomes the primary payer in foreign countries.

You may have to pay out-of-pocket and file for reimbursement.

This structure makes planning essential if you expect to live or travel extensively outside the United States. You may want to explore international health insurance if this applies to you.

TRICARE Young Adult: A Temporary Solution for Dependents

If you have adult children between 21 and 26, they lose dependent eligibility under TRICARE at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in college). TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) can provide temporary coverage, but it comes with separate enrollment and higher premiums.

TYA ends at age 26, after which your child must find their own insurance, either through an employer or the healthcare marketplace.

What Happens if You Delay Medicare Part B?

You must enroll in Medicare Part B when you become eligible to keep TRICARE For Life. If you delay enrollment:

You lose TRICARE coverage until you enroll in Part B.

You may face a lifetime Part B late enrollment penalty.

There are only limited exceptions, such as having employer-sponsored coverage at age 65. Even then, you need to enroll promptly once that coverage ends to avoid losing TRICARE.

Planning Ahead: Your Action Checklist

To make the most of your TRICARE and retirement healthcare:

Review your TRICARE eligibility annually as your age and family situation evolve.

Enroll in Medicare Parts A and B when you turn 65.

Consider FEDVIP enrollment for dental and vision.

Assess long-term care needs early, as this is not covered by TRICARE or Medicare.

Talk to a licensed professional about coordinating benefits if your spouse has other coverage.

TRICARE Is Strong, But Pairing It Wisely Is Smarter

As a retired service member, you earned your TRICARE benefits through years of dedicated service. But the evolving nature of healthcare in retirement means that relying solely on TRICARE—especially after age 65—could leave you with unexpected costs or limited access to services like dental, vision, or long-term care.

Take the time now to evaluate how TRICARE For Life interacts with Medicare, and whether you should pair it with other programs such as FEDVIP or long-term care insurance. Your retirement health plan should be as strong as your military career—strategic, resilient, and ready for the future.

The two bills below, signed into law by Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday, represent significant steps in improving health care accessibility and affordability for Maryland residents.

Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for All Marylanders Now Act

This bill increases the authority of Maryland’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Created by the General Assembly in 2019, the board was the nation’s first independent body with authority to review affordability of drug prices and recommend ways to address high costs, including setting upper limits on what Marylanders would pay for them.

The Maryland Prescription Drug Affordability Board has authority to set the upper payment limits for high-cost prescription drugs used by individuals on state and local government health plans. The new law now allows the board to set an upper payment limit on all high-cost prescription medications purchased by individuals on private insurance plans. It specifically excludes any purchases where federal law preempts state law, Medicare Part D, for example, Tricare or the federal employee health benefit program.

Federally Qualified Health Centers Grant Program - Acquisition of Land

This bill modifies the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) Grant Program administered by the Maryland Board of Public Works. The program currently makes grants to counties, municipal corporations and nonprofit organizations for various purposes related to health centers, such as converting public buildings, acquiring existing buildings, renovating facilities, purchasing equipment and planning new centers.

The legislation allows the grant program to be used to acquire land where an FQHC will be constructed or used. These health centers are community-based and receive federal funding to provide primary care services to underserved areas. The program’s expansion would take effect Oct. 1.

By increasing funding and operational support, supporters of the bill hope it will reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for underserved Maryland communities. The legislation does not increase the amount of state money available to fund the program.

The two bills represent a significant commitment by Maryland lawmakers to making health care more affordable and accessible to its residents. The Miles & Stockbridge health care team will continue to monitor developments as the laws are implemented and are available to answer health care providers’ questions about the legislation.

The IG report said Defense Health Agency officials agreed with their findings and committed to implementing their recommendations.","Inconsistencies between states could have cost U.S. taxpayers and Tricare beneficiaries millions of dollars in excessive payments for some medical procedures and devices, a watchdog report has found.

The cost of certain medical procedures and devices varied greatly from state to state, according to a Pentagon inspector general audit published May 1. That probe found Tricare — the military’s Defense Health Agency-run medical insurance provider that covers some 9.5 million troops, veterans and their family members — paid out thousands of dollars more for similar procedures and medical devices in some states versus others. The report found inconsistent DHA policies governing the amount of money that Tricare pays for medical care.

In one instance, the IG found Tricare was paying some $11,500 for custom sleep apnea mouthguards in Illinois that were costing it about $3,000 in neighboring Iowa. The payment discrepancy came about because Tricare, which is split into two regions in the U.S. with Illinois in its east section and Iowa in its west, uses contractors to establish a basic pay rate, known as a prevailing rate, for standard procedures and devices based on the amounts that providers in those states had charged Tricare in the past. The state’s prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of all those charges.

The IG found there were no efforts to ensure payment rates were more consistent from one state to another. The auditors recommended Defense Health Agency officials reevaluate their methodology and ensure payment rates are not based on fraudulent or unreasonable rates charged in the past.

“Because the DHA did not determine that the state prevailing rates were reasonable, the [Defense Department] is at risk of wasteful spending and increasing DOD beneficiaries’ risk of unreasonable cost-shares for health care services and items that are paid with state prevailing rates,” the report states.

The probe also found Tricare might have been overpaying for some more rare procedures that do not have a set reimbursement rate. In fiscal 2023, Tricare paid some $183.3 million for 184 of those “miscellaneous procedure costs.” The IG found in some cases Tricare might have paid greatly inflated rental rates for medical equipment in that miscellaneous category.

In one Tricare East case, the organization paid about $5,000 per month to rent a compression device for a beneficiary when another supplier advertised renting the same device for $675 per month. Still another supplier advertised it sold a different model of a similar device for $409.50, according to the report.

The IG said despite the discrepancies, recent changes to Tricare policies have led to lowered costs for the organization since 2021.

The IG report said Defense Health Agency officials agreed with their findings and committed to implementing their recommendations.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/hwu4pl-bob-reid-pentagon-picture/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Bob%20Reid%20Pentagon%20picture,N,-1.0,2025-05-27 17:56:45.560349

What Rehab Services Does TRICARE Cover for Addiction Treatment?
How Can I Verify My TRICARE Coverage for Rehab Services?
Verifying your TRICARE coverage for rehabilitation services is a straightforward process that begins with understanding your specific TRICARE plan.
Many TRICARE-approved facilities employ dedicated insurance specialists who can assist with pre-authorization requirements and explain the specific services covered under your plan.","Military service members face unique stressors that can contribute to substance abuse problems, including combat exposure, deployment-related trauma, and the challenges of military culture. TRICARE rehab insurance provides crucial coverage for substance abuse treatment, offering military personnel and their families access to a comprehensive range of rehab services.

TRICARE’s expansion of covered services in recent years has significantly improved access to evidence-based treatments, allowing service members to seek help through military treatment facilities or approved providers. By removing financial barriers using insurance for addiction treatment, TRICARE enables those affected by substance use disorders to receive the specialized care they need while maintaining their privacy and professional standing, ultimately supporting both individual recovery and military readiness.

What Rehab Services Does TRICARE Cover for Addiction Treatment?

TRICARE offers comprehensive coverage for substance use disorder treatment through various programs and settings. Coverage includes:

Detox services: Medically supervised withdrawal management in inpatient or outpatient settings

Inpatient/residential treatment: 24-hour structured care in hospital or non-hospital settings

Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs): Structured treatment several days per week

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs): Day treatment programs offering more support than traditional outpatient care

Standard outpatient therapy: Individual, group, and family counseling

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT): Coverage for medications like buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone to treat opioid and alcohol use disorders

Opioid treatment programs: Specialized programs for opioid addiction

Mental health services: Concurrent treatment for co-occurring mental health conditions

Emergency services: Coverage for substance-related emergencies

TRICARE requires prior insurance authorization for addiction treatment for most intensive services, and beneficiaries typically pay cost-shares based on their specific TRICARE plan. Coverage length varies based on medical necessity and treatment progress, with regular assessments determining continued authorization.

To ensure coverage, services must be provided by TRICARE-authorized providers. Beneficiaries are encouraged to work with their primary care manager or contact TRICARE directly to understand specific coverage details and find approved treatment facilities.

How Can I Verify My TRICARE Coverage for Rehab Services?

Verifying your TRICARE coverage for rehabilitation services is a straightforward process that begins with understanding your specific TRICARE plan. First, locate your TRICARE member ID card and contact your regional TRICARE contractor directly through their designated beneficiary services hotline.

When speaking with a representative, clearly explain the type of rehabilitation services you’re seeking, like substance use disorder treatment, and ask for detailed information about coverage limitations, prior authorization requirements, and any associated drug rehab costs like copayments or cost-shares. You can also access your benefits information through the secure TRICARE online portal, where you’ll find personalized coverage details and the ability to download verification documents that treatment facilities may require for admission.

Before committing to any rehabilitation program, it’s essential to verify that your chosen provider is TRICARE-authorized. Services from non-network providers may result in higher out-of-pocket expenses or may not be covered at all. Contact the rehabilitation facility directly and provide them with your TRICARE information, asking them to conduct a benefits verification on your behalf. This verification should confirm important details like covered services, the length of treatment authorized, and your financial responsibility.

For complex rehab needs, consider requesting a referral from your Primary Care Manager. This can help facilitate the authorization process and ensure your treatment plan aligns with TRICARE’s medical necessity criteria. Coverage may vary based on your duty status, specific TRICARE plan, and the type of treatment being sought, so verification should be completed before beginning any rehabilitation program.

How Do I Find TRICARE-Approved Rehab Centers?

Locating TRICARE-approved rehab centers begins with utilizing the official TRICARE provider directory available through the TRICARE website. This searchable database allows beneficiaries to filter results by location, specialty, and acceptance of a specific TRICARE plan.

Military members and their families can contact their regional TRICARE contractor directly through the beneficiary services hotline for more personalized assistance. These representatives can provide up-to-date information about facilities that meet TRICARE’s stringent quality and credentialing requirements.

Military treatment facilities often serve as excellent starting points, as they can provide direct services or facilitate referrals to approved civilian rehabilitation centers. The Military OneSource program offers confidential consultations to guide service members toward appropriate TRICARE-approved treatment options without impacting their military records or career progression.

When evaluating potential drug rehab centers, it is advisable to verify their TRICARE status directly with the facility and your TRICARE regional contractor. This double-verification approach helps prevent any misunderstandings about coverage or unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.

Many TRICARE-approved facilities employ dedicated insurance specialists who can assist with pre-authorization requirements and explain the specific services covered under your plan. Veterans and active duty personnel should also inquire about programs designed explicitly for military-related substance use disorders, as these specialized treatment approaches often address co-occurring conditions like PTSD or combat-related trauma.

While TRICARE covers medically necessary addiction treatment, the specific authorization period and level of care covered will depend on individual clinical assessments. Therefore, it is crucial to work closely with your healthcare providers throughout the rehabilitation process to ensure continuous coverage as treatment needs evolve.

Are There Limits to TRICARE’s Rehab Coverage?

TRICARE does have specific limits on rehabilitation coverage that are important to understand. Here are the key limitations:

Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapy Limits

Standard outpatient therapy: Generally limited to 24 visits per year without prior authorization

Additional visits: May be approved with proper medical documentation showing continued need

Authorization requirements: Increases after initial assessment visits (typically 2-3 visits)

Inpatient Rehabilitation Limits

Length of stay: Typically approved for specific periods, requiring reassessment

Medical necessity: Must be documented and continually justified

Level of care criteria: Must meet specific clinical requirements

Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Inpatient/residential: Limited to 21-28 days per admission (varies by plan)

Outpatient visits: Usually 60-90 days of coverage for intensive outpatient programs

Annual limits: May have caps on treatment episodes per benefit period

Learn How to Access TRICARE Rehab Services With Help From Muse Treatment

Many service members turn to substances to cope with physical injuries, mental health conditions like PTSD, and the difficult transition between deployment and home life. Unfortunately, stigma around seeking help remains a significant barrier, with many fearing career repercussions if they admit to struggling.

TRICARE rehab plays a critical role in dismantling the financial barriers that might otherwise prevent military members from accessing vital substance abuse treatment. For service members struggling with addiction, comprehensive TRICARE coverage means they can focus on recovery rather than worrying about devastating out-of-pocket costs for detox, rehab, counseling, and medication-assisted treatment.

Muse Treatment accepts TRICARE to create a safer pathway for service members to seek the treatment they need without fear of career repercussions. This ultimately supports both their personal recovery and their continued ability to serve effectively. To explore addiction rehab options, call Muse Treatment in Los Angeles at 800-426-1818 today.

Alpha Company of the 307th Engineer Battalion [47] was given the mission to destroy warehouses in the NW portion of Khamisiyah ASP.
This was confusing information because it referred to two locations, a known site (Nasiriyah), and an as yet unknown site (Khamisiyah).
Just prior to September of 1995, CIA analysts resurfaced the UNSCOM October 1991 Khamisiyah site visit report during a re-examination of thousands of intelligence reports and other intelligence holdings.
Unfortunately, no such video, photographs or logs have been found that document the March 10, 1991 demolition.","The XVIII Corps (ABN) had the mission to conduct movement to contact operations, including attacking and securing Objective GOLD (later identified as Khamisiyah). On Feb. 26, 1991, the first U.S. troops to reach Khamisiyah were from the 24th ID(MECH).

On the northern end of BP 102, Lt. Col. John Craddock maneuvered his 4-64th Armor Battalion toward a canal north of Highway 8....Continuing north, the battalion overran a huge, untouched ammunition storage area and pushed the beaten Iraqis protecting the facility into the weeds near the canal [14].

On Feb. 26, 1991, the 24th ID(MECH) received information from the XVIII Corps (ABN) that there were ""possible chemicals on Objective GOLD [15]"". On Feb. 27, 1991, the 24th ID(MECH) secured Objective GOLD [16] and continued eastward beyond Khamisiyah to cut-off retreating Republican Guard divisions near Basrah. On Feb. 28, 1991, the 82nd Div (ABN) was located west of the 24th ID (MECH) with the ""3rd Brigade conduct[ing] movement to Objective GOLD [17]"". On March 1, 1991, the objective was secured [18].

Although there is no evidence to date that the 82nd Div (ABN) received the warning from the XVIII Corps (ABN) of possible chemicals on Objective GOLD, in reporting activities that occurred in securing Khamisiyah, the 82nd Div (ABN) Chemical Officer noted that standard procedures were followed:

When the 82nd Div (ABN) initially occupied the sector, FOX vehicles and unit reconnaissance teams checked for evidence of contamination or chemical weapons. No contamination was found. Riot control agent CS was found in the Tall al Lahm ASP.....White phosphorus [artillery] rounds were also found. Artillery rounds with fill plugs and central bursters were found. They were marked with a yellow band. They were empty. Other rounds in the area were marked similarly. FOX reconnaissance determined they [the rounds] contained TNT [19].

On March 1, 1991, the 2nd Platoon, Charlie Company, 307th Engineer Battalion, in direct support of TF 2-505, part of the 82nd Div (ABN), reconnoitered Khamisiyah ASP and concluded that demolition operations would require additional engineer support. Subsequently, the 37th Engineer Battalion was told to destroy the approximately 100 bunkers at Khamisiyah ASP [20].

On March 2, 1991, the XVIII Corps (ABN) noted:

XVIII ABN Corps continues defensive/ security operations in zone with emphasis on force protection, clearing of residual enemy personnel in sector and destruction/evacuation of captured enemy equipment. Now that the tempo has dropped, units are able to begin clearing bunker complexes that were initially bypassed to maintain momentum. Divisions are discovering large numbers of bunkers/underground complexes containing weapons, ammunition and other materials. Destruction of these bunkers has already begun; however, the enormity of the task before us and amount of resources required is still unknown.

Commander's evaluation... Our emphasis is on protection of the force and operations [21].

Early on March 2, 1991, a platoon from Charlie Company, 37th Engineer Battalion arrived at the Khamisiyah ASP as an advance party for the battalion [22]. Upon its arrival, the unit found a large number of the local civilians and many animals inside the ASP; many were inside the bunkers as well [23].

On March 3, 1991, the remainder of the 37th Engineer Battalion (-) [24] and two teams (three soldiers each) from the 60th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Detachment arrived at Khamisiyah [25]. The battalion had M8A1 chemical alarms mounted on various unit vehicles, and these were reported to be operational [26]. The battalion's chemical noncommissioned officer stated he was in ""MOPP 4"" [27] and checked [28] some of the bunkers for chemical agents. The results of these checks were reported to be negative. As part of the operation, the U.S. troops searched the site for any ""special"" weapons, that is chemical weapons and laser- or optically-guided munitions. They found one rocket with possible intelligence value; all remaining were deemed conventional [29]. Two bunkers (98 and 99) were exploded to test demolition techniques [30].

On March 4, 1991, the three line companies of the 37th Engineer Battalion, assisted by the two teams of the 60th EOD, were each assigned 12 to 14 bunkers to inventory and demolish [31]. According to the Charlie Company Commander, ""the explosive ordnance guys came through and said, here's what you're looking at. These are safe to destroy."" [32] Therefore, the engineers planned to use the explosives necessary to destroy conventional munitions. A total of 38 [33] bunkers were rigged with explosives, including the bunker subsequently reported by the Iraqis as containing chemical munitions (Bunker 73). Reports and interviews [34] indicate that approximately 300 engineer and EOD personnel participated in the demolition at the ASP, and about 770 additional personnel from the 505th Infantry secured the area.

At approximately 2 p.m. on March 4, 1991, 37 of the 38 bunkers exploded (explosives in Bunker 92 failed to go off due to a bad time fuse) [35]. The weather was clear, with winds coming from the SW [36]. The engineer battalion set up an observation point approximately 3 to 4 kilometers northwest, and crosswind of the Khamisiyah ASP (see unit location on Figure 2).

At approximately 2:45 p.m. on March 4, 1991, an M8A1 chemical alarm in Bravo Company, 37th Engineer Battalion sounded at the observation point. Since troops were at MOPP 0 [37], upon hearing the alarm, some went to MOPP 4 status, and others only donned their masks [38]. Each company and EOD team [39] performed several M256 kit tests [40]. Two NBC NCOs interviewed say they got ""weak"" or ""slightly"" positive results on M256 tests, although the test kit is designed to show either positive or negative results. The Bravo Company Commander observed the test performed by his NBC NCO and states he saw a negative result, not a ""weak positive."" The second NBC NCO states he did a second test that was negative [41] [42]. An ""all clear"" was then signaled. Interviews of medical personnel at battalion/brigade/division/corps-level did not reveal any evidence of symptoms or health problems related to chemical warfare agent exposure during the entire period in question [43]. Debris from the exploding bunkers (described as fragments, and in some instances intact weapons) landed in or near the observation point, so troops were moved further away from Khamisiyah [44].

On March 5, 1991, there were heavy rains in the morning, and many vehicles became stuck. The 60th EOD teams examined the bunkers from the previous day's demolition and determined one bunker (92) did not explode. The explosives were re-fused and set off without incident [45]. EOD reviewed the results of the previous day's demolitions and decided to use a different technique to destroy the remaining bunkers [46]. Alpha Company of the 307th Engineer Battalion [47] was given the mission to destroy warehouses in the NW portion of Khamisiyah ASP. The XVIII Corps (ABN) SITREP for this day also noted that the 82nd Div (ABN) destroyed ASPs at Jalibah and Tallil. There is no mention of Khamisiyah or Objective GOLD [48].

On March 6, 1991, each engineer company of the 37th Engineer Battalion and Alpha Company from the 307th Engineer Battalion exploded a bunker to test the latest techniques for demolition developed by the 60th EOD. The EOD experts attempted to implode the bunkers [49] in order to reduce the number of secondary explosions and to conserve the amount of explosives used. During March 7-9, 1991, no demolitions were performed because of poor weather. The time was used for demolition training, rehearsals, and inventorying [50] the remaining bunkers and warehouses.

On March 9, 1991, the Operations Officer of the 37th Engineer Battalion found crates of 122mm rockets outside the SE corner of Khamisiyah ASP [51]. A noncommissioned officer from the Headquarters & Headquarters Company (HHC) of the battalion was told to destroy these munitions in what is now called the ""pit"" area of Khamisiyah [52].

On March 10, 1991, at approximately 3:40 p.m., crates of rockets in the ""pit"" were detonated. At the same time, the 60 remaining bunkers were detonated by 37th Engineer Battalion, and the warehouses were blown up by Alpha Company of the 307th [53]. There is some confusion as to whether the HHC NCO with a two-man detail was the only group setting explosives in the ""pit."" Photo analysis of the ""pit"" reveals 13 separate stacks of material. The HHC NCO and one of his detail both state they rigged 3 stacks of rockets for demolition, no other stacks were observed, and no one else was working in the ""pit."" However, an EOD NCO says he led a 15 - 20 man engineer/soldier detail that destroyed approximately 850 rockets (6 to 8 stacks) in the ""pit"" on the same day as the ""big explosion"" on March 10 [54].

An accounting of demolition at the ""pit"" is also noted in the 60th EOD log [55] for March 12, 1991. It was recorded that 840 ""5-inch"" (this measure approximates 122mm) rockets were destroyed at coordinates for Khamisiyah ASP. This report, however, conflicts with information provided by an NCO from the 60th EOD [56] [57].

The 37th Engineer Battalion observation point for the demolition on March 10, 1991 was south of Khamisiyah on MSR 8, approximately 20-30 minutes travel time by vehicle away from the ASP. Once they heard explosions, the 37th continued south towards Saudi Arabia [58] for approximately four more hours. The weather was overcast skies with poor visibility; wind direction and speed on this date are the subject of ongoing investigation by the Institute for Defense Analysis and CIA.

On March 12, 1991, the 307th Engineer Battalion [59] identified additional ammunition stores southwest of Khamisiyah ASP, described as ""another enemy bunker complex of more than 400 revetted bunkers with large caches inside."" [60] During the period March 15-19,1991, the 307th Engineer Battalion rigged explosives on the munitions found in the berm area southwest of Khamisiyah ASP. On March 20, the berm area was detonated at approximately 3:30 p.m. [61].

On March 23, 1991, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, part of the U.S. VII Corps, assumed responsibility for the area of operations, which included Khamisiyah. The 84th Engineer Company and the 146th EOD were among their supporting units. On March 24, 1991, the 82nd Div (ABN) [62], the 307th Engineer Battalion, and the 60th EOD departed for Saudi Arabia and subsequent redeployment [63].

On March 27, 1991, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment was told to determine if Tall al Lahm Ammo Storage Depot South (100 revetments) and Tall al Lahm Ammo Storage Facility [Khamisiyah] contained possible chemical/biological munitions.[64] On March 28,1991, the unit reported to VII Corps that chemical/biological reconnaissance of both Tall al Lahm sites yielded negative results. [65]

On April 2,1991, the 82nd Engineer Battalion, located south of the area of operations, reported hearing a large explosion in the vicinity of Tallil, another site of demolition, approximately 40 km from Khamisiyah. [66]

On April 6, 1991, members of the 84th Engineer Company and 146th EOD re-examined bunkers at Khamisiyah ASP, and determined that six bunkers required additional detonations to destroy remaining munitions. [67]

The last American units departed Khamisiyah in late April 1991.

Further details on this chronology are being gathered in the continuing investigation by the Investigation and Analysis Directorate of the Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses.

In April 1991, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 687, setting specific terms for a formal cease-fire to end the conflict between Iraq, Kuwait and the countries cooperating with Kuwait [68]. In May 1991, in response to UN Security Council Resolution 687, the Iraqis declared to UNSCOM that ""Khamisiyah (Nasiriyah)"" was a chemical weapons storage site, although it was not included in their first declaration to the UN in April 1991. This was confusing information because it referred to two locations, a known site (Nasiriyah), and an as yet unknown site (Khamisiyah).

In October 1991, UNSCOM sent a team to inspect six of the sites which were not near Baghdad. The site map provided to the UNSCOM Team was labeled ""An Nasiriyah Depot S.W. (Khamisiyah),"" and it depicted the layout of what U.S. Intelligence knew as An Nasiriyah ASP. However, the UNSCOM Team was not taken to An Nasiriyah, but to a different site, which is now known to be Khamisiyah. They were shown artillery shells and rockets in two separate areas apart from the main ASP (see Figure 2). An open area, 3 kilometers west of the bunkers, contained 6,323 155mm artillery shells filled with mustard agent. These shells were undamaged and were stored in an orderly fashion (in several stacks/clusters) under tarpaulins, using the natural terrain features to hide them. The second area, located in a ""pit"" south of the main bunker complex, contained 297 122mm rockets in three to four ""heaps,"" some of which were damaged but most were intact. Some rockets were neatly laid out, while others appeared to have been bulldozed into piles or heaps. Many rockets were leaking, and plastic inserts and other features characteristic of chemical munitions were observed, so UNSCOM personnel drilled into one of the intact rockets to take a sample. The sample was later analyzed and found to be a chemical warfare nerve agent (sarin/cyclosarin).

The Iraqis told UNSCOM in 1991 that chemical rockets found in the ""pit"" had been salvaged from Bunker 73, which had been destroyed as part of the demolition operations by Coalition Forces. UNSCOM acknowledged that Bunker 73 appeared damaged, but did not thoroughly inspect the bunker. Chemical agent monitoring at the bunker site was negative. No other observations were documented concerning remains of munitions, such as whether there were observable plastic inserts or other paraphernalia characteristic of chemical munitions.

In November 1991, the U.S. Intelligence Community became aware of the results of the UNSCOM Khamisiyah Ammunition Storage Facility site visit [69]. The U.S. Intelligence Community did not believe Iraqi accounts to the UN that chemical weapons had been blown up at Khamisiyah by the coalition forces at the end of the war [70]. They believed the Iraqis were engaged in possible deception, consistent with the observations of UNSCOM in their inspections and analysis of Iraqi declarations [71].

Despite their doubts, intelligence analysts initiated a search for any U.S. units involved in blowing up munitions at Khamisiyah. A response to their request dated Nov. 12, 1991 indicates that they had ""received information from ARCENT [the Army Central Command] to the fact that 24th Mechanized Infantry Division was located in the vicinity of Tall al Lahm, but [were] unable to confirm if U.S. troops did in fact destroy buildings at this particular site."" [72] ARCENT mistakenly identified the 24th Infantry Division as being in the area at the time, although they had not carried out the demolition at Khamisiyah. The ARCENT lead was followed, and a Nov. 20, 1991 message notes that ""Info on Tall al Lahm Ammo Depot was passed to ... G-2 Office, Ft. Stewart, GA,"" Headquarters of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division. Further, this message states ""info on presence of troops there and their activities during Desert Storm were requested...."" [73] The IAD has followed that lead; after more than five years, the person contacted at Fort Stewart has no specific recollection of being contacted or of any specific subsequent actions taken. Additional follow-up has provided no further leads at this point [74].

During a March 1992 visit, the UNSCOM Team consolidated and destroyed at least 500 122mm rockets. According to the UNSCOM press release [75].

On March 30,1992, the munitions destroyed included full, partially full, and empty rockets. This number includes the 297 rockets mentioned previously, which were found in the ""pit"". In addition to the rockets destroyed in the March 1992 site visit, more than 200 [76].

Rockets were unearthed by the Iraqis in the ""pit"" and shipped to Al Muthanna for destruction. More than 700 rockets or major rocket parts in all were found in the ""pit"" area. The actual number of rockets in the ""pit"" and Bunker 73 is unknown, and continues to be topic of questioning during interviews with 1-800 callers and other interviewees.

In February 1994, Congressman Browder (D-AL) requested from the UN any reports pertaining to chemical weapons found in Iraq after the Gulf War. The UN responded by letter in April 1994, providing in tabular format a listing of the sites at which Iraqi chemical warfare agents/weapons were found. Included in this listing was the ""Khamisiyah Storage Site."" [77].

In May 1994, witnesses from DOD testified before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee (the Riegle Committee) on matters relating to export administration. In the course of that testimony, DOD witnesses acknowledged that the UN had found chemical munitions at a site, 15 nautical miles from An Nasiriyah, but stated that U.S. forces were not at that site, which they said was north of the Euphrates River [78]. Review of the testimony and responses to questions for the record submitted by DOD in September and October 1994 reveals that there was true confusion as to the location of Khamisiyah and its proximity to U.S. troops. Furthermore, DOD believed that any destruction of chemical munitions at this ""other site"" (Khamisiyah) probably had occurred after the war as part of an Iraqi deception campaign. [79]

This belief formed the basis for information provided to the Defense Science Board Task Force Persian Gulf War Health Effects in June 1994. The Task Force report stated that:

There were also reports of damage by the United Nations Special Commission inspection team that visited a different location in the general vicinity of An Nasiriyah several months after the cessation of hostilities. There are indications that the site visited by the UNSCOM team was not a site targeted during the air war but may have been specially constructed for the UN inspectors. [80]

In November 1994, Congress directed the expansion of a DOD Gulf War registry, to include all servicemembers [81]. The agency tasked with responsibility for compiling the unit locator database was the Environmental Support Group (ESG) (now referred to as the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records). The ESG unit locator database incorporates all available coordinates (both latitude/longitude and universal trans-mercator indices) derived from unit logs, situation reports, etc. It reports the location of many, but not all, of the U.S. units in Iraq and Saudi Arabia during the conduct of the Gulf War by unit identification codes (UICs) and time.

In March 1995, the President directed [82] a more intensive effort to discover the causes of illnesses among Gulf War veterans. As concern over the Gulf War illnesses mounted the Acting Director Central Intelligence directed the CIA to conduct a comprehensive review of relevant intelligence information. In this review the CIA focused on identifying and quantifying Iraqi chemical, biological, or radiological releases during and after the war that could have reached U.S. troops [83]. As part of the President's initiative, the DOD and the CIA initiated new efforts to collect and review operational, intelligence and medical records from the war. In April, declassification of health documents started, and in June 1995, the Persian Gulf Illnesses Investigation Team was established to provide a DOD organization to manage the different investigations which were now on-going.

Just prior to September of 1995, CIA analysts resurfaced the UNSCOM October 1991 Khamisiyah site visit report during a re-examination of thousands of intelligence reports and other intelligence holdings. On Sept. 6, 1995, the CIA identified Khamisiyah as a key unresolved chemical weapons release issue, which raised special concern because its southerly location put it closest to U.S. troops. On Sept. 13, 1995, CIA informed DOD's PGIIT of Khamisiyah's potential relevance to the exposure issue and asked whether U.S. military forces had been at the site [84]. DOD searched the newly constructed ESG unit locator database and indicated that some units were in the area. In October 1995, PGIIT learned from the ESG that the 37th Engineer Battalion reported a location coordinate near Khamisiyah, but there was no indication of their mission. At that time, no follow-on investigation into the 37th Engineer Battalion activities was conducted.

The CIA continued to monitor the DOD's Khamisiyah investigation and to conduct their own research. On Jan. 26, 1996, the CIA briefed the National Security Council staff that U.S. troops probably blew up chemical weapons at Khamisiyah. The Presidential Advisory Committee [85], formed in May 1995, was subsequently made aware of these initial findings. DOD and the CIA began an intense and comprehensive effort to research and analyze the Khamisiyah events. Concern about U.S. exposure increased as the topic became more fully understood. By early March 1996, CIA and PGIIT pieced together previously unanalyzed information indicating activity at the Khamisiyah ASP, and, for the first time, they received clear indications that the 37th Engineer Battalion blew up Bunker 73 at Khamisiyah.

On March 10, 1996, a CIA analyst heard a tape recording of a radio show during which a veteran (Mr. Brian Martin) of the 37th Engineer Battalion described demolition activities at a facility the analyst immediately recognized as Khamisiyah [86]. Although Mr. Martin had previously testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee and had been contacted by DOD after the release of the Riegle report [87], it was not until the CIA analyst heard the 10 March 1996 broadcast that the possible connection between An Nasiriyah demolitions and the bunkers at Khamisiyah was drawn. DOD and the PAC were notified of this connection on March 11, 1996.

A PGIIT investigator contacted Mr. Martin on March 11, 1996 about the demolition he had witnessed, and, with assistance from the PAC, Mr. Martin provided a video tape that showed the demolition activities he had witnessed. Another version of the tape [88] confirms the event on Mr. Martin's tape as the demolition at Khamisiyah on March 4, 1991. Review of these tapes has provided much useful information to the investigation by confirming events and weather data. Unfortunately, no such video, photographs or logs have been found that document the March 10, 1991 demolition.

On May 1, 1996, the CIA publicly announced at a PAC hearing that UNSCOM had found chemical weapons at Khamisiyah and, that ""elements of the 37th Engineer Battalion.... performed demolition of munitions at this facility"" during 1991 [89].

On May 14, 1996, UNSCOM again visited Khamisiyah. During this visit, the Iraqis told the inspectors that the 6,323 mustard rounds had been moved to Khamisiyah from Al Muthanna to An Nasiriyah in January 1991 after the beginning of the Gulf War. The Iraqis further stated that about 2,160 sarin/cyclosarin rockets were also brought from Al Muthanna in January 1991, and stored in Bunker 73 until a chemical leak was discovered, causing approximately 1,100 of the rockets to be moved to the ""pit"" area in February 1991. According to the Iraqis, this was done before the Coalition Forces destroyed the ammunition storage area.

On June 21, 1996, DOD held a news briefing to detail these findings on Khamisiyah. The DOD said:

UNSCOM has informed us that, as part of its ongoing effort to verify Iraqi declarations, it inspected the Khamisiyah ammunition storage area last month [May 1996]. During that inspection, UNSCOM concluded that one bunker had contained rockets with chemical agents. U.S. soldiers from the 37th Engineer Battalion destroyed ammunition bunkers at this site in early March 1991,shortly after the war ended. Based on a new review of the available information, it now appears that one of these destroyed bunkers contained chemical weapons [90].

After the June 21,1996 announcement, the focus of investigation shifted to better understand two questions. First, what was the potential for exposure to chemical agents at Khamisiyah, and second, who might have been exposed. DOD merged the ESG unit locator database with DMDC personnel databases to identify the people actually deployed at varying distances from Khamisiyah ASP in early March 1991 [91]. Efforts are on-going to identify additional units and individuals which were in the vicinity of Khamisiyah (see Tab B to this document). In addition, the PGIIT, CIA, and DMDC conducted interviews with U.S. troops known to be involved in the demolition to try to reconstruct such information as the exact dates of the demolition, amount and type of munitions destroyed, and weather and wind direction on the dates of demolition.

On Aug. 7, 1996, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs designed and conducted a telephone outreach to veterans who may have participated in the operation at Khamisiyah ASP. Based on a search of the ESG database and over 100 interviews, the PGIIT was able to determine units potentially involved in this operation. Individuals were selected for the telephone outreach based on their Gulf War assignment to one of these units.

DMDC identified 1,179 individuals assigned to units thought to have participated in the operation. Of those identified, 542 individuals were contacted and completed the survey, 14 were uncooperative with telephone operators, and 12 individuals are deceased. The telephone outreach effort concluded in October 1996. All individuals who were not able to be contacted via the telephone were mailed a certified letter, informing them of the incident and requesting they share any information pertaining to the incident through the 1-800 hotline. 259 individuals received the certified letter but did not contact DMDC, and 352 individuals have yet to receive a letter because either it is in the process of being forwarded to them or they have no known address.

The personal descriptions of the incident offered by each individual completing the survey were analyzed to screen for potential leads for the continuing investigation. The PGIIT used the data as a basis for follow-up interviews. Of the total 542 contacted, 39 individuals mentioned chemical alarms sounding during this period. These 39 reports, and all subsequent reports of chemical alarms sounding, are the subject of continuing examination and further analysis by the investigators of the IAD, the successor organization to PGIIT.

Given the uncertainty concerning the fallout from the ""pit"" demolition on March 10, 1991 and after careful review of the CIA's preliminary results, DOD decided to be conservative and notify all those who were thought to be within a 50 kilometer radius of Khamisiyah ASP between March 1 and 15, 1991. Letters were sent to approximately 21,000 Gulf War veterans. The intent of these letters was to inform them of the incident; to inform them of the potential for low-level exposure to chemical warfare agent; to explain how to sign up for examination in the DOD or Department of Veterans Affairs registries; and to notify them of a forthcoming survey to query for specific unit/individual location information, chemical exposure data, and health and medical program participation questions. The most important part of the letter was:

We need to hear from you, not only about your experience in the vicinity of the site, but also about any health problems you think may be a result of your service during Operations Desert Storm/Desert Shield. Your timely response to the survey will provide us with critical information. If you have information that you believe would be of immediate value to us pertaining to the events at Khamisiyah, please call the PERSIAN GULF INCIDENT HOTLINE at 1-800-472-6719.

If you are experiencing health problems you believe to be a result of your service in Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield and you are eligible for health benefits through the Department of Defense, please call the COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL EVALUATION PROGRAM at 1-800-796-9699. If you are eligible for benefits provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs system, please call the PERSIAN GULF HELPLINE at 1-800-PGW-VETS [95]. Mailing of the survey started 10 January 1997 and is still continuing [96].

This case is still being investigated. As additional information becomes available, it will be incorporated. If you have records, photographs, recollections, or find errors in the details reported, please contact the DOD Persian Gulf Task Force Hot Line at 1-800-472-6719

CCEP

Developed by a multi-disciplinary team of DOD and VA medical specialists, the CCEP provides a two-phase, comprehensive medical evaluation. Phase I is conducted at the local military hospital or clinic and consists of a history and medical examination comparable in scope and thoroughness to an in-patient hospital admissions evaluation. The medical review includes questions about family history, health, occupation, unique exposures in the Gulf War, and a structured review of symptoms.

Health care providers specifically inquire about the symptoms and Persian Gulf exposures listed on the CCEP Provider-Administered Patient Questionnaire. The medical examination focuses on patients' symptoms and health concerns and includes standard laboratory tests (complete blood count, urinalysis, serum chemistries) and other tests as clinically indicated.

Individuals who require additional evaluation after completing the Phase I evaluation and appropriate consultations may be referred to one of 14 Regional Medical Centers for Phase II evaluations. RMCs are tertiary care medical centers that have representation from most major medical disciplines. Phase II evaluations consist of symptom-specific examinations, additional laboratory tests, and specialty consultations according to the prescribed protocol.

Cyclosarin

A nerve gas agent commonly referred to as GF, similar to sarin (GB) (see below), but more persistent.

Detection Paper

Detection paper is based on certain dyes being soluble in chemical warfare agents. Normally, two dyes and one pH indicator are used, which are mixed with cellulose fibers in a paper without special coloring (unbleached). When a drop of chemical warfare agent is absorbed by the paper, it dissolves one of the pigments. Mustard agent dissolves a red dye and nerve agent a yellow. In addition, VX causes the indicator to turn to blue which, together with the yellow, will become green/green-black.

Detection paper can thus be used to distinguish between three different types of chemical warfare agents. A disadvantage with the papers is that many other substances can also dissolve the pigments. Consequently, they should not be located in places where drops of, e.g., solvent, fat, oil or fuel can fall on them. Drops of water give no reaction.

On the basis of spot diameter and density on the detection paper, it is possible to obtain an opinion on the original size of the droplets and the degree of contamination. A droplet of 0.5 mm diameter gives a spot sized about 3 mm on the paper. A droplet/cm2 of this kind corresponds to a ground contamination of about 0.5 g/m2. The lower detection limit in favorable cases is 0.005 g/m2.

M256A1 Chemical Agent Detection Kit

The M256A1 kit is a portable, expendable item capable of detecting and identifying hazardous concentrations of chemical agent. The M256 kit is used after a chemical attack to determine if it is safe to unmask. The M256A1 kit has replaced the M256 kit. The only difference between the two kits is that the M256A1 kit will detect lower levels of nerve agent. This improvement was accomplished by using an eel enzyme for the nerve test in the M256A1 kit in place of the horse enzyme used in the M256 kit.

M8A1 Chemical Alarm

The M8A1 is an automatic chemical agent detection and warning system designed to detect the presence of nerve agent vapors or inhalable aerosols. The M8A1 will automatically signal the presence of the nerve agent in the air by providing troops with both a audible and visible warning. The M8A1 was fielded to replace the wet chemical M8 detector with a dry system which eliminated the M229 refill kit, the logistic burden and associated costs. The M8A1 operates in a fixed, portable, or vehicle mounted configuration.

Mustard

Mustard ""gas"" refers to several manufactured chemicals including sulfur mustard. They do not occur naturally in the environment. The term gas is in quotes because mustard ""gas"" does not behave as a gas under ordinary conditions. Mustard ""gas"" is really a liquid and is not likely to change into a gas immediately if it is released at ordinary temperatures. As a pure liquid, it is colorless and odorless, but when mixed with other chemicals, it looks brown and has a garlic-like smell. Mustard ""gas"" was used in chemical warfare and was made in large amounts during World Wars I and II. It was reportedly used in the Iran-Iraq war in 1984-1988. It is not presently used in the United States, except for research purposes.

The only way that mustard ""gas"" would enter the environment [other than through use as a weapon] would be through an accidental release. Some evaporates from water and soil into air. It does not easily go into water, and the amount that does breaks down quickly. It is more stable in soil than in water but still breaks down within days, depending on the outside temperature (cold weather makes it more stable). It does not go from soil to groundwater. Mustard ""gas"" does not build up in the tissues of animals because it breaks down so quickly. Mustard ""gas"" makes your eyes burn, your eyelids swell, and causes you to blink a lot. If you breathe mustard ""gas,"" it can cause coughing, bronchitis, and long-term respiratory disease.

Sarin

Sarin is a light brown liquid. It is odorless, and evaporates about as fast as gasoline. It is toxic both as fumes and to the touch. It is not as persistent an agent as Tabun or Soman, the other two of the trinity of nerve gases developed in Germany. Sarin, along with Tabun and Soman was invented not long before the Second World War by German scientist Dr. Gerhard Schrader. While developing insecticides similar to malathion and parathion, he discovered the first ""nerve gas"" agents, as they were then called. In 1936 he discovered Sarin. The Germans stockpiled these weapons during the Second World War, but never used them, probably because of Hitler's personal distaste for the weapons (he himself was a victim of gas attacks in Flanders during the First World War). Sarin is now known as ""GB.""

Only very small amounts of Sarin are needed to kill. A single milligram of Sarin coming in contact with the skin is sufficient to kill. In a vaporous form, it takes a concentration of 100 milligrams per cubic meter to be fatal. Nerve gases such as Sarin are known as ""organophosphorus anticholinesterases"" or ""OP's."" Their chemical method of killing is to block the enzyme cholinesterase. The body's muscles receive electrical impulses caused by choline. Cholinesterase break down choline, making sure these impulses stop at the proper time. Cholinesterase attaches itself to choline and breaks it down, thus halting the impulse. Sarin fools thecholinesterase into acting upon the Sarin as it would choline. When the cholinesterase attaches itself to Sarin, it doesn't break down. Thus, choline is not broken down, and the body goes into convulsions.

The first symptoms start in the eyes, where the pupils contract and vision is blurred. It causes breathing problems and chest tightness. Finally it produces vomiting and headaches, after which the heart and lungs stop as the body convulses. The antidote is a substitute for the missing cholinesterase, which is atropine.

The armed forces in the Gulf War were given Oxime tablets in case of gas attack, which acts to release cholinesterase from the Sarin.

UN Security Council Resolution 687

This resolution was adopted by the UN Security Council at its 2981st meeting, on 3 April 1991. The pertinent section of this resolution, as related to the Khamisiyah report, follows:

6. Notes that as soon as the Secretary-General notifies the Security Council of the completion of the deployment of the United Nations observer unit, the conditions will be established for the Member States cooperating with Kuwait in accordance with resolution 678 (1990) to bring their military presence in Iraq to an end consistent with resolution 686 (1991);

Invites Iraq to reaffirm unconditionally its obligations under the Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925, and to ratify the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, of 10 April 1972;

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.

In a 58-second video posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed COVID-19 shots from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.

A CDC advisory panel is set to meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.

But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait. He said that annual COVID-19 booster shots have been recommended for kids “despite the lack of any clinical data” to support that decision.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Jay Battacharya, head of the National Institutes of Health, appeared in the video with Kennedy.

Kennedy and other Trump administration appointees have been moving to narrow COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and added restrictions to a recent vaccine approval. Last week, the FDA announced routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.

HHS officials did not immediately respond to questions about why Kennedy decided to take the step now or release additional information about what went into the decision.

,,2025-05-27 15:25:44+00:00,The Virginian-Pilot,"Tricare errors put families at risk of higher costs, audit finds - The Virginian-Pilot",Gavin Stone,,,,,https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/05/27/tricare-errors-audit/,"Virginia is among the states with higher rental rates than purchasing costs.
In fiscal year 2023, Tricare contractors paid a total of $183 million for items or services that didn’t have a defined reimbursement rate.
State prevailing rates are established by taking all the billed charges for a service or item in the previous year and separating them by state.
The state prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of the charges for that service or item in each state.
A Tricare spokesperson did not respond to an emailed question about how soon beneficiaries might see a change in costs.","Tricare, the federal health-insurance program for military service members and their families, and the Defense Health Agency that governs it, put beneficiaries at risk of paying much higher costs due to a lack of internal controls, according to an audit conducted by the Department of Justice.

The audit by the Inspector General reviewed financial records across both Tricare’s East and West regions (which includes all 50 states) from November 2023 to February 2025, found that policy did not require federal officials or the company to ensure that rates for services or equipment that don’t already have a defined reimbursement rate were “reasonable or consistent with other states,” and contractors did not have guidance on how to create new rates.

This caused a contractor in Illinois to pay $11,500 for custom sleep apnea mouth guards, a price 283% higher than the cost in neighboring Iowa, according to the audit report. The DHA also allowed rental costs for medical items to far exceed the cost of purchasing, resulting in a contractor paying Tricare $5,000 per month to rent one of two compression devices while the same product was available to rent for $675 per month and another supplier was selling one for $409.50.

Virginia is among the states with higher rental rates than purchasing costs. For a particular compression device, the rental cost per month in Virginia was $4,680 compared to $3,450 to buy it, a 35.7% difference. Connecticut had the highest difference at 100.2%, according to the audit.

In fiscal year 2023, Tricare contractors paid a total of $183 million for items or services that didn’t have a defined reimbursement rate. It’s unclear how much of that total is considered “unreasonable” and how much additional financial burden was passed on to beneficiaries.

“Because the DHA did not determine that the state prevailing rates were reasonable, the DoD is at risk of wasteful spending and increasing DoD beneficiaries’ risk of unreasonable cost-shares for health care services and items that are paid with state prevailing rates,” the audit concludes.

State prevailing rates are established by taking all the billed charges for a service or item in the previous year and separating them by state. The state prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of the charges for that service or item in each state.

The amount the DHA has reimbursed providers for all health care services and items has decreased by 16% since fiscal year 2021 as a result of measures taken in response to prior DOD reviews, according to the audit.

The federal agency issued a policy in July that allows contractors to set payment thresholds to “prevent reimbursement substantially in excess of customary or reasonable charges.”

The Inspector General recommends that the DHA reassess and revise the state prevailing rates in Tricare’s policy to ensure rates are “reasonable,” develop and issue guidance to require an independent party to review the state prevailing rates annually, and implement an oversight mechanism.

DHA has hired a company to monitor the accuracy of payments made by Tricare contractors. In 2022 and 2023, this company found that Tricare had a quarterly error rate of 0.31% or less and 0.4% or less, respectively, across both the East and West regions. These error rates are lower than Tricare’s own maximum allowable error rate of 1.75%.

Once you reach FRA, you can earn unlimited income without reducing your Social Security.","May 27, 2025 — Washington, D.C. | On Memorial Day 2025, Marine Corps veteran and Social Security expert Ed Weir hosted a special live Q&A to answer key questions facing U.S. veterans today. His heartfelt session covered everything from retirement filing and SSDI rules to Medicare pitfalls and surviving spouse benefits, with a powerful reminder to honor those who gave their lives in service.

This article offers a comprehensive breakdown of the key takeaways for veterans and their families.

Do Military Veterans Get Extra Social Security?

Yes—but the extra amount is modest and depends on the years of service:

1940–1956: An additional $160 per month added to past earnings.

1957–1977: $300 per quarter added to earnings (approx. $100/month).

1978–2001: Similar credits continue, but automatically added if SSA verifies military service.

After 2001: No special military wage credits—automatic reporting applies.

Important: If you served in the military and apply online or over the phone, you must report your service dates. If unsure, call the SSA and ask if your DD214 is on file.

Can You Receive Both VA Disability and Social Security Disability?

Yes. You can receive VA disability and SSDI simultaneously—but they are completely separate programs.

VA Disability: Based on service connection; allows you to work.

SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance): Based on inability to engage in “substantial gainful activity.”

Receiving VA benefits does not guarantee SSDI approval. However, veterans with a 100% permanent and total VA rating or those in the Wounded Warrior program may qualify for expedited processing.

Medicare vs VA Health Care: Should Veterans Pay for Part B?

Many veterans rely solely on VA healthcare, but skipping Medicare Part B can lead to lifetime penalties:

Part B costs $185/month in 2025 (income-based adjustments apply).

If you delay enrollment and lose VA access later, you may:

Wait until the General Enrollment Period (Jan–Mar).

Pay a 10% penalty for each 12-month delay.

Tip: Consider a Medicare Advantage “Give-Back” Plan

Some plans (like Honor or Patriot plans) reduce or pay back part of your Part B premium and allow dual coverage with the VA. Not all include drug coverage—but you can still use the VA pharmacy, which offers excellent low-cost medications.

What If You Have TRICARE for Life?

If you retired from the military, you likely qualify for TRICARE for Life, which acts as your Medicare supplement:

Must enroll in Medicare Part A and B at age 65.

No need for a separate Medicare supplement or Advantage plan.

Just present your TRICARE card + Medicare card at appointments.

Veterans often ask if Advantage plans offer extra benefits. Dr. Ed advises: TRICARE + Original Medicare is sufficient for most.

Survivor & Family Benefits: What Veterans’ Families Should Know

Spouses, widows, and dependent children may be eligible for benefits based on the veteran’s earnings and service history.

Widows aged 60+ can receive reduced survivor benefits (71.5% of PIA).

Disabled widows may apply as early as age 50.

Grandchildren: Only qualify if adopted by the veteran or if both parents are deceased or disabled.

You must apply separately for these benefits through SSA.

Can Working While Receiving Social Security Reduce Benefits?

It depends on your age:

If you start benefits before full retirement age (FRA) and earn over the limit ($23,400 in 2025), SSA may withhold $1 for every $2 over the cap.

Once you reach FRA, you can earn unlimited income without reducing your Social Security.

Even if SSA withholds early checks, you can recover lost value once you reach FRA—your benefit will be recalculated

As Dr. Ed put it:

Free and confidential mental health services

Service members’ ability to regulate emotions in healthy ways plays a crucial part in their ability to cope with challenges. Military OneSource and Military and Family Life Counselors are examples of free and confidential mental health counseling programs that offer military members and their families counseling to address short-term, non-medical concerns. Counselors within these programs are equipped to help service members improve healthy stress management, time management, and decision-making strategies and tools, including the ability to problem solve, manage conflict, build coping skills, and adapt to change. In addition, these programs foster health, resiliency, and readiness.

Military OneSource

Military OneSource is a U.S. Department of Defense program that provides free, short-term, solution-focused, confidential, non-medical counseling services for a wide range of issues, including relationship conflicts, stress management, parenting issues, coping with grief and loss, and managing deployments.

In addition to providing counseling for military- and life-related stressors, Military OneSource offers webinars and online trainings on topics including tax services, spouse employment, relocation and deployment, and stress management.

Counseling sessions can take place in a variety of forms:

In person - Face-to-face confidential counseling in an office setting with a counselor located in the local community.

Telehealth - Confidential telephonic Military OneSource counseling for service members and family members who are unable to attend in-person counseling sessions. Telephonic counseling is only available to adults aged 18 and older.

Military and Family Life Counseling

The Military and Family Life Counseling Program provides free, confidential counseling to service members, their families, and survivors on or near installations. Counselors are licensed to practice independently in the location where they are providing services and are trained to deliver valuable counseling services, briefings, and presentations to the military community. The MFLC program was designed to deploy counselors rapidly for short- and long-term assignments based on each military branch’s specific need.

The MFLC Program provides non-medical counseling for issues requiring short-term attention, including everyday stressors, deployment and reintegration concerns, parenting, grief and loss, and marital issues. MFLCs conduct consultation and outreach services to more than 200 military installations or nearby civilian communities located in most of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and over 25 foreign countries including areas considered hazardous duty/danger zones. MFLCs provide support to individuals, couples, families and groups for a range of issues including, but not limited to, deployment stress, reintegration, relocation adjustment, separation, anger management, conflict resolution, parenting, parent-child communication, relationship and family issues, coping skills, homesickness, grief and loss, isolation from extended family members, children coping with the absence of a parent, child education, and spousal employment.

Additionally, there are Child and Youth Behavioral Military and Family Life Counselor programs that specifically provide support to military children and families on topics including, but not limited to, identifying feelings, bullying, conflict resolution, self-esteem, anger management, family concerns, problem-solving, coping with deployment and reunification, transition and moving, sibling and parental relationships, time management, and divorce.

Confidential mental health resources

Confidential counseling provides service members and their loved ones with resources and support to address a variety of issues and build important skills to tackle life's challenges.

Confidential counseling is crucial for the military because it allows service members to seek support openly and discuss personal concerns when needed without fear of repercussions on their career or unit standing. With confidential services, a service member’s personal information is not provided to their military chain of command, shared with family or friends, or released to other agencies. Although services are confidential, one caveat is that counselors are required by law to report illegal activities or situations where there could be danger to the service member or to others. These include suspected domestic violence and child or elder abuse or neglect.

Other benefits of confidential military counseling:

Reduces stigma - By ensuring privacy, it removes the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, making it more likely for service members to access necessary care.

Improves unit cohesion - Addressing personal issues through confidential counseling can help service members better manage their emotions and perform effectively within their unit.

Builds resilience - Open communication with a counselor allows service members to develop coping mechanisms and build resilience against the unique stressors of military life.

Supports family well-being - Confidential counseling is also available for military families, helping them navigate challenges related to deployments, frequent moves, and other stressors.

Provided access to specialized support - Military counseling programs often provide specialized support tailored to military experiences, such as combat trauma or deployment-related issues.

In addition to mental health counseling services, there are apps that promote healthy techniques for managing stress, seeking help with life challenges, addressing health problems, and implementing safety measures against harmful behaviors.

Dr. Jorge Zamora-Quezada falsely diagnosed many of his patients, some as young as 13, with rheumatoid arthritis over the course of nearly 20 years—putting them through tests, hours of intravenous infusions, and what federal prosecutors described as other ""excessive, repetitive and profit-driven"" procedures. The more than $118 million in fraudulent health insurance claims the Texas physician submitted paid for his high-rolling lifestyle, according to the Justice Department. Last week, Zamora-Quezada, whose medical license was canceled in 2021, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the crimes, the New York Times reports. Prosecutors said the scheme included:

A coverup: Zamora-Quezada dropped any patients who questioned his diagnoses and hired employees he could manipulate over their immigration status. He fabricated records, sometimes took ultrasounds of employees he used as documentation for insurer audits. He hid patient records in a dilapidated barn in the Rio Grande Valley; they were found covered with feces, urine, rodents, and termites.

The toll: His patients, some of whom he gave chemotherapy drugs, suffered strokes, necrosis of the jawbone, hair loss, liver damage, and debilitating pain. The number of patients Zamora-Quezada misdiagnosed in all is not known.

The haul: Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Blue Cross Blue Shield paid him a total of more than $28 million in false claims. Zamora-Quezada amassed two luxury penthouse apartments in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; condominiums in San Diego; Aspen, Colorado, and Punta Mita, Mexico; as well as multiple homes and commercial properties in Texas. The doctor traveled between his offices in the Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio in a private jet and a Maserati.

Honestly it’s my only complaint about CHAMPVA: if I want to see a real doctor in an actual hospital, I’m gonna have to carry insurance and then pay for all of the out of pocket. My family has all of their out of pocket covered since I keep them on my private insurance.

My advice? Hold onto that Tricare with both hands and go see private doctors often enough to make sure they agree with what the VA is doing. You never know; your current VA might be good, but if you move or when your current primary moves on to the private sector that can change pretty abruptly.",,N,0.0,2025-05-27 04:56:35.536487

In total, his scheme involved $118 million in false claims, defrauding $28 million from insurance companies.

Videos by Suggest

According to a press release issued by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Public Affairs, Zamora-Quezada was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, seven counts of healthcare fraud, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Zamora-Quezada managed to defraud a multitude of insurance companies by falsely diagnosing his patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These include Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

He would administer “toxic medications” and make his patients believe they had the disease, which lasts for life and is incurable. That way, his patients were treated continuously at his offices.

To further expand his fraudulent scheme, Zamora-Quezada fabricated medical records. That way, he could effectively lie to his patients’ insurers by claiming they were sick with the aforementioned disease. As previously stated, he managed to secure $118 million in false claims and defrauded $28 million from insurance companies.

‘Unnecessary Treatments’

Following his faux diagnoses, Zamora-Quezada administered “unnecessary treatments” and even ordered equally unnecessary testing. These tests, which included x-rays, MRIs, infusions, and injections, can be fatal due to their potential side effects.

The effects of his reckless and illegal behavior were made evident. Some of his patients suffered serious side effects. These include, but are not limited to, strokes, jawbone necrosis, and liver damage.

“Constantly being in bed and being unable to get up from bed alone, and being pumped with medication, I didn’t feel like my life had any meaning,” one patient testified in court.

Furthermore, Zamora-Quezada also intimidated and manipulated his employees, referring to himself as “eminencia,” or “eminence” in English. He would intentionally hire employees on J-1 visas to have further control over them, threatening their legal status.

“Dr. Zamora-Quezada funded his luxurious lifestyle for two decades by traumatizing his patients, abusing his employees, lying to insurers, and stealing taxpayer money,” Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said. “His depraved conduct represents a profound betrayal of trust toward vulnerable patients who depend on care and integrity from their doctors.”",https://www.suggest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jorge-Zamora-Quezada.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-25 19:56:19.838197

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years.
Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.","Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapy rooted in the science of learning and behavior. Using principles of ABA, children and adults can learn to improve their communication skills, social skills, and daily living skills while also addressing problematic or challenging behaviors. The primary goal of ABA therapy is to teach helpful skills that promote independence and reduce harmful behaviors. Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.
