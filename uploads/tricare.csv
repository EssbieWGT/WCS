What is a government shutdown and how will it affect the Coast Guard?

A shutdown happens when Congress fails to pass appropriations or a continuing resolution to fund federal agencies and program. Once the funding lapses, in this case on Sept. 30, agencies must cease operations financed by those appropriations, except for functions that are legally required to continue.

The Coast Guard generally will continue operations authorized by law that are necessary for the safety of human life, protection of property, or national security. This includes emerging contingency operations like hurricane preparedness and response. The Coast Guard will also continue to focus on asserting presence and securing America’s borders.

How will I be affected?

It depends on which of the following categories you fall into:

Excepted employees include all military members, plus anyone else whose work is considered essential to safeguarding life or property, or otherwise mandated by law. If you’re an excepted employee you will continue working during the funding lapse.

Furloughed (non-excepted) employees are those whose functions are considered non-essential and whose pay is tied to appropriations. Furloughed employees will be placed in a non-duty, non-pay status and must stop working during the shutdown.

Exempt employees are not affected by the lapse in appropriations because they are paid out of special fees or multi-year accounts.

Contractors should check their status with their Contracting Officer Representatives.

What happens to pay?

Excepted employees work during the shutdown but may not receive pay until the government reopens. Furloughed employees do not work or get paid during the shutdown. But thanks to the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (GEFTA), both furloughed and excepted employees are guaranteed back pay once funding is restored. The timing of this pay depends on how quickly Congress acts to restore funding. Your benefits, such as health and retirement, continue during the shutdown period, although payroll deductions will stop until pay is restored.

Military Members' Pay: All Coast Guard military personnel have received a full paycheck covering the current pay period (ending Sept. 30). If a shutdown extends beyond Oct. 13, members will miss the mid-October paycheck. If a shutdown extends past Oct. 13, members will be paid about two days after the shutdown ends.

Below is a hypothetical example:

If a shutdown were to occur from 01-21 October, military members would receive their missed mid-October paycheck on or about Oct. 23. They would also receive their full paychecks at end of the month in October (on time).

Note this is different than past shutdowns which occurred after a short-term Continuing Resolution. In these past situations, the Coast Guard was able to set-aside a portion of available funding to ensure we could cover at least one paycheck after a shutdown. In the current situation, the potential shutdown would occur at the very beginning of the fiscal year (Oct. 1); thus, there is no funding available to set aside for military pay.

Civilian Members' Pay: All civilian employees have received a full paycheck from Pay Period 18 (on or about Sept. 29). All civilians paid out of single-year appropriations (the vast majority of our civilian workforce) will receive approximately 70% of their Pay Period 19 paycheck on or about Oct. 16. Similar to the military workforce, there is a roughly two-day delay to receive back-pay once a shutdown concludes. Please note that exempt civilian employees funded from the Coast Guard Yard working capital fund and un-expired multi/no-year appropriations will be paid on time during a lapse.

Back-Pay: By law, all military and civilian personnel are guaranteed to receive back-pay once a potential lapse in appropriations concludes.

Military Retiree Pay: All retired military personnel (including Coast Guard) will receive pay on time during a government shutdown. This is because military personnel are paid out of a trust fund.

Will I work during a shutdown?

Military personnel are statutorily exempt and shall report to duty – as directed by their commanding officers, officers-in-charge, and supervisors – to support missions that are legally authorized to continue during an appropriations lapse.

Civilian personnel positions are categorized as exempt, non-exempt, or excepted. Exempt and excepted employees shall report to work as usual. Non-exempt employees will be furloughed. Your immediate supervisor should already have notified you of your status; if you are not sure, please contact your immediate supervisor.

What kind of duties am I expected to conduct during a shutdown?

During a lapse in appropriations, the Coast Guard may only conduct activities that are vital to national defense and safety of life and property.

For guidance on support systems services, see ALCOAST 411/25 (CAC required) from the Deputy Commandant for Systems (DCS)

For guidance on personnel support services, see ALCOAST 412/25 (CAC required) from the Deputy Commandant for Personnel (DCP)

Operational commanders should review ALCOAST 413/25 (CAC required) from the Deputy Commandant for Operations (DCO)

Do reservists have to drill during a shutdown?

Reserve ADT/IDT in support of excepted functions, including training to maintain proficiency, shall be in accordance with ALCOAST 413/25 (CAC required for access).

How does a shutdown impact the Coast Guard Auxiliary?

Auxiliary activity may only be performed if it is specifically ordered by a Coast Guard command in direct support of an exempt activity. Exempt activities are primarily limited to urgent Search and Rescue (SAR), Aids to Navigation (ATON) outages, and national security threats.

Will military medical and dental be available during a shutdown?

Yes, uniformed staff at regional healthcare practices will be available to provide services to eligible beneficiaries. Coast Guard clinics will continue to operate during the lapse. Additionally, all TRICARE services and coverage will be available for all eligible beneficiaries during the lapse in appropriation.

Where can I get support during a shutdown?

Employee assistance and military work life services remain available to the workforce and their families 24/7/365. The Military OneSource services are the gateway to trusted information, resources and confidential help for active-duty members and their families through Military OneSource or by calling (800) 342-9647. The Federal Occupational Health (FOH) Employee Assistance Program offers confidential support and resources for the well-being of civilian employees and their families through the https://www.foh4you.com site or by calling (800) 222-0364. Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocate Program Specialists will be available.

Will Coast Guard Child Development Centers remain open?

Yes, Child Development Centers will remain open to all enrolled.

Will galleys, commissaries, or exchanges be open during the shutdown?

Yes, the Coast Guard Exchange System will remain open. In addition, galleys will be open during a shutdown.

Am I expected to pay my bills during a shutdown?

During a lapse, Coast Guard members must continue to meet all civil obligations, including insurance, rent/mortgage, child care, and child support, regardless of the government’s ability to process payroll. If you have set up direct financial allotments through the Coast Guard payroll system, please remember that no funds will be transferred during a furlough. Remember to review your automatic payments and make any necessary adjustments. Creditors are not obligated to provide relief, so communicate with them quickly if you anticipate any temporary financial constraints.

Will retirees get paid?

Military Retirees and Survivor Benefits Plan (SBP) beneficiaries are not impacted by a lapse in appropriations and will continue to receive disbursements.

Will military members receive SGLI, Tricare, and medical Benefits?

All medical benefits and insurance premiums remain current. These will be processed and paid once payroll resumes after the shutdown. Both you and your dependents will continue to have access to your primary medical providers.

Will I get reimbursed for travel during the shutdown?

Members with orders for official travel will be reimbursed after the shutdown ends. To be paid as quickly as possible, submit your claims through ETS within three days of travel.

If you incur fees due to a class/orders cancellation (i.e., service fees/cancellation fees), you will be reimbursed after the shutdown ends. The Coast Guard and DHS will work with the Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) bank, to prevent members from incurring delinquency and interest charges for travel if the lapse approaches 30 days. Commands shall handle account delinquency situations on a case-by-case basis. Travelers who have submitted a timely travel voucher but have not been reimbursed due to furlough, should not be subject to adverse action by the chain of command for account delinquency.

Will I get reimbursed for pre-shutdown travel?

Travel conducted prior to a lapse in appropriations will be reimbursed once the financial system re-opens after the shutdown.

Will military members be able to attend training during the shutdown?

Coast Guard Active Duty and Reserve members shall execute orders to Class ""A"" and Class ""C"" Schools during a lapse in appropriations unless otherwise advised by Education & Training Quota Management Command (ETQC). Active duty and Reserve members currently in attendance or in receipt of orders to Class “A” School or any enlisted or officer accession training shall continue training as planned.

Civilian employees in receipt of Class “C” school orders shall not execute those orders. Units shall send a cancellation notice to ETQC. Civilian employees currently in attendance at Class “C” school are responsible for contacting their supervisor to determine their status (i.e., exempt/non-exempt/excepted).

Auxiliarists will not be permitted to attend Class “C” school training on funded orders during a lapse. Auxiliarists may, however, attend Class “C” school training on no cost orders.

How does a shutdown affect tuition assistance?

Tuition Assistance (TA) applications will continue to be accepted during a lapse in appropriations. However, members should not assume TA is authorized until they receive their approved TA application from the ETQC. Students already approved and enrolled in courses will continue to receive TA.

Am I able to attend conferences?

Attendance at conferences during a lapse in appropriations is prohibited. This includes conferences that have already been approved by DHS prior to the lapse. Regardless of furlough status, no Coast Guard personnel may attend conferences during the lapse in appropriations either as an attendee or presenter. This prohibition includes no-cost local travel. Units requiring clarity on virtual attendance via teleconference shall obtain clearance from the Servicing Legal Offices and RMO/RA then send that request to CG-81 and CG-LGL for concurrence.

Can I fundraise for myself during the shutdown?

Federal employees may not engage in fundraising in an official capacity or in the federal workplace, except in limited circumstances (see 5 CFR 2635.702 and 5 CFR 2635.808).

Coast Guard employees have previously sought financial assistance through electronic “crowdsourcing” campaigns through platforms such as GoFundMe. Such campaigns raise a variety of ethics concerns and require careful planning to avoid violating ethics rules, employees are urged to always check with their Servicing Legal Office prior to launching a crowdsourcing campaign. Generally, federal employees or those related to federal employees may not use a crowdsourcing campaign to raise funds simply because they are in a non-pay status.

Federal employees are urged to check with their servicing legal office before engaging in fundraising or other functions that might violate a federal ethics rule.

What kind of outside support can I receive during a shutdown?

In general, employees/members can accept opportunities and other benefits provided by sources that are closely affiliated with the Coast Guard, such as the Chief Petty Officers’ Association (CPOA), local Spouses Clubs, and Auxiliary Flotillas. These sources may not discriminate amongst Coast Guard employees by official responsibility or on a basis that favors those of a higher rank or rate of pay.

Acceptable forms of support include:

Restaurants offering free meals to local Coast Guard members

Food bank offering groceries to all furloughed federal employees

Cash grants from charitable organizations to all veterans impacted by a government shutdown

Gift cards (cash equivalent and store) offered to all members of a Coast Guard unit

Unacceptable forms of support include:

Gift cards (cash equivalent and store) offered to all members of a Coast Guard unit by the owner of an inspected vessel

Offer of cash to just one or two persons at a unit from a local member of the community

Free meals offered to a unit’s command cadre

Any command or member with questions of what support or gifts can be accepted should call their servicing legal office.

With Congress locked in a budget battle and unable to reach a compromise, the U.S. government went into a partial shutdown at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 1. While some critical government functions will continue to operate, others will be paused.

Those U.S. citizens who collect Social Security – including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers – won’t see an interruption in their monthly payments during the shutdown. Food assistance programs will continue until they run out of funds.

While U.S. military operations will continue during a shutdown, U.S. servicemembers will miss at least one paycheck if a budget deal isn’t in place by Oct. 15. A shutdown also will force the furlough of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, including those in public affairs and community outreach personnel, financial management personnel and acquisition personnel.

For the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the department estimates that 97 percent of its employee will continue to work during a shutdown. VA benefits will continue to be processed and delivered, including compensation, pension, education and housing benefits. However, VA benefits regional offices are closed.

VA medical centers, outpatient clinics and Vet Centers remain open.

Here is an overview of how VA services, other DoD operations and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are affected.

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs

Programs not impacted

· Burials will continue at VA national cemeteries. Applications for headstones, markers, and burial benefits processing will continue.

· The Board of Veterans’ Appeals will continue decisions on veterans’ cases.

· Call Centers: VA’s primary call center (1-800-MyVA411) and the Veterans Crisis Line (Dial 988, Press 1) will remain open 24/7. The VA Benefit Hotline (1-800-827-1000) will be available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET.

· Suicide prevention programs, homelessness services, and caregiver support will continue.

Impacted programs

· VA will cease providing transition program assistance and career counseling.

· Call Centers: VA’s GI Bill (1-888-GIBILL-1) and National Cemetery Applicant Assistance (1-800-697-6947) hotlines will be closed.

· VA benefits regional offices will be closed.

· Public Affairs and outreach to Veterans will cease, including social media, VetResources emails, and responses to press inquiries.

· No grounds maintenance or placement of permanent headstones at VA cemeteries.

· Applications for pre-need burial at VA cemeteries will not be processed.

· No printing of new Presidential Memorial Certificates.

· No outreach to state, county, tribal, municipal, faith-based, and community-based partners by VA Central Office.

U.S. Department of Defense

· Operations. Subordinate leaders in the DoD have the authority to evaluate and determine whether activities are “excepted” for supporting high priority efforts and for the safety of human life and protection of property. As of September 2025, the department considers the following among its highest priorities: Operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East Operations, Golden Dome for America, Depot Maintenance, Shipbuilding and Critical Munitions.

· Servicemember Impact. Though not getting paid, active-duty servicemembers, including reserve component personnel on federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties. National Guard servicemembers performing duties under Title 32 will be terminated unless such duties are in support of excepted activities defined by the department. Reserve servicemembers performing Active Guard Reserve (AGR) duty will continue to carry out AGR authorized duties for the period of their AGR tour. Reserve servicemembers will not perform inactive duty resulting in the obligation of funds, except in support of military operations necessary for national security, disaster response or fulfilling pre-deployment requirements. And Temporary Duty Travel (TDY) scheduled to begin after the shutdown may be cancelled if not in support of an excepted activity, such as returning to one’s official duty station. Those on PCS orders attending training and educational activities may continue to attend classes only if the instructor is military or is a contractor paid with prior year funds. PCS orders for duty station changes may be impacted if not funded with prior year funds.

· Quality of Life Impact: On the medical side, inpatient care, acute and emergency outpatient care in DoD medical facilities will continue during a shutdown. Elective surgeries and other procedures may be postponed or canceled. Private health care through TRICARE will not be affected. Services and counseling for victims of sexual assault, religious, suicide, substance abuse, counterdrug activities and operations of mortuary affairs will still be provided during a shutdown. On the education side, schools that are operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity will remain open, but sports and extracurricular activities will result in a pause during a shutdown. Mess hall operations, physical training and “childcare activities required for readiness” would continue in a shutdown. Meanwhile, the operation of childcare centers is still to be determined. During past shutdowns, childcare centers depended on the level of base staffing and demand. Thus, a shutdown would affect childcare on a case-by-case basis.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

· Impact to operations. DHS secures U.S. borders and critical infrastructures, while protecting the U.S. from hybrid threats. A shutdown would disrupt DHS’s ability to work effectively, leaving Americans less safe. Without proper pay, both members of the U.S. Coast Guard and border agents may have less productivity due to financial uncertainty, further decreasing DHS’s ability.

· U.S. Coast Guard: The 40,000 active-duty members of the U.S. Coast Guard will continue to work and will only be compensated for their unpaid work if an appropriation is passed. Members of the Coast Guard are unable to file for interim support that would supplement their income. During the longest government shutdown (2019), members needed severe assistance for the costs of shelter, food, utilities, clothing and health expenses.",https://www.legion.org/assets/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-10-01 14:57:21.901226

The meeting comes amid continued momentum in security ties, even as trade relations between the two countries face occasional friction.

Earlier in September, Kwatra also met U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby at the Pentagon, where the two reviewed defense cooperation initiatives and reaffirmed their commitment to advancing strategic collaboration.

Egg- and non-egg-based influenza vaccines showed equivalent protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza‑like illness and related hospitalizations among healthy adults in the military health system. However, recombinant influenza vaccine achieved higher seroconversion rates across all influenza subtypes.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers conducted a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine and a recombinant influenza vaccine with that of an egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine among military health system beneficiaries over four influenza seasons from 2018 to 2022.

A total of 15,432 participants (32.1% women; 79% younger than 45 years) across ten US sites were randomly assigned to a control group that received the egg-based inactivated vaccine (n = 5148) or to test groups that received the cell culture-based inactivated vaccine (n = 5130) or the recombinant vaccine (n = 5154).

Participants completed weekly text or email surveys beginning 2 weeks after vaccination, reporting any influenza-like illness symptoms over the past 7 days; a nasal swab and a blood sample were collected if influenza-like illness was reported.

The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza, detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from study-collected swabs or positive clinical tests at least 14 days post-vaccination.

A secondary aim of the study was to compare the immunogenicity of the cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines with that of the egg-based vaccine in a subset of 1087 participants, with samples taken before vaccination and 21-35 days post-vaccination.

TAKEAWAY:

Influenza occurred in 1.7% of cell culture-based vaccine recipients, 1.5% of recombinant vaccine recipients, and 1.3% of egg-based vaccine recipients; most laboratory-confirmed cases were due to subtype influenza A.

No significant difference in vaccine effectiveness was seen between the cell culture-based and egg-based vaccines (relative vaccine effectiveness [rVE], -26.53%; 95% CI, -73.13% to 7.53%) or between the recombinant and egg-based vaccines (rVE, -14.36%; 95% CI, -57.59% to 17.01%).

Recombinant vaccine recipients achieved higher seroconversion rates than egg-based recipients across all subtypes, whereas cell culture-based vaccine recipients achieved higher seroconversion rates than egg-based recipients only for virus subtype A/H3N2.

When egg-based vaccines were compared with either cell culture-based or recombinant vaccines, no significant differences in rVE were observed for influenza subtypes, influenza-like illness, or related hospitalizations.

IN PRACTICE:

“This study did not detect significant differential effectiveness of newer non-egg-based influenza vaccines compared to egg-based products in preventing influenza illness in a population of predominantly healthy, working-age adults with low influenza incidence,” the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Rhonda E. Colombo, MD, MHS, from the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program, Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland. It was published online on September 18, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

LIMITATIONS:

This study was limited by the small number of influenza cases, and the wide CIs around rVE point estimates indicated that a higher infection rate might have uncovered clinically meaningful differences. The open-label design may have introduced bias, and the largely young, healthy sample limited generalizability to older adults or those with comorbidities.

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton is Ohio’s largest single-site employer with more than 38,000 military, civilian and contractor employees.

It boasts an annual economic impact of $4.2 billion.

According to a contingency plan from the Pentagon, all active-duty troops across the board are required to keep working but civilian employees will face furloughs unless they are deemed mission critical.

Pay will be affected starting with the Oct. 13 payday.

Backpay is guaranteed, but it will not process until the shutdown ends or another exemption passes.

Mono-mono twins occur in approximately 1% of identical twin pregnancies and less than 0.1% of all pregnancies.
But now 10 months old, the twins are thriving, despite doctors warning Michaela and Elijah they would likely have developmental issues.
“We got super lucky.” Being in the Navy added to their luck from a financial perspective as well.","Michaela and Elijah Dominguez weren’t expecting any surprises when, on a whim, they decided to get a 3D ultrasound 20 weeks into Michaela’s second pregnancy. Already the parents of an 18-month-old daughter, the Navy petty officer second class and his wife had been through it all before.

“I’m laying on the table, and my toddler’s holding my hand,” said Michaela. “And the tech is like, ‘I think I have mirror image on, because I’m seeing two.’ And my husband is looking at the screen like, ‘Oh my gosh, there are literally two heads.’”

The couple’s shock at discovering the twin pregnancy changed to fear once doctors discovered the Dominguez family was in the incredibly rare position of expecting monoamniotic-monochorionic (mono-mono) twins.

Mono-mono twins occur in approximately 1% of identical twin pregnancies and less than 0.1% of all pregnancies. They share both an amniotic sac and placenta, which leads to much higher risk than a typical pregnancy. Their umbilical cords can become entangled, leading to potentially fatal cord compression. The twins can also develop twin-twin transfusion syndrome, where blood is unevenly distributed between the twins and causes an imbalance in amniotic fluid, also a possibly fatal condition.

30% of mono-mono twins do not survive.

“The cord entanglement was so bad it looked like Celtic knots,” Michaela said. “I was going to the doctor every single day, with every appointment being an ultrasound appointment.”

Elijah had recently transferred to a new administrative position at Fleet Readiness Center Southeast in Jacksonville, Fla., and was initially concerned about how the stress of Michaela’s high-risk pregnancy would affect his work.

“But the assistant officer in charge pulled me aside and said, ‘Hey, Dominguez, I know that you’re new here … but we’re here for you, anything you need,’” Elijah said.

Michaela’s doctors already planned to deliver the twin girls by 34 weeks, so when they began to develop twin-twin transfusion syndrome at 32 weeks, Michaela had a scheduled cesarean section. Both twins spent 38 days in the NICU.

“They had a lot of growing to do,” said Michaela.

But now 10 months old, the twins are thriving, despite doctors warning Michaela and Elijah they would likely have developmental issues. “They’re crawling!” she said. “They’re pulling up on things!”

“They’re babbling,” Elijah added with a laugh.

“They’re doing everything they’re supposed to do,” said Michaela. “We got super lucky.”

Being in the Navy added to their luck from a financial perspective as well. The medical expenses would have been astronomical — almost $250,000 before insurance. But TRICARE coverage knocked the cost down to approximately $300 per twin.

Now living in San Antonio where Elijah is a Navy recruiter, the Dominguez family of five is healthy, happy and grateful for the support they received at Fleet Readiness Center Southeast.

“They were always checking up on both of us,” Michaela said. “There was never a moment where I felt bad about all these doctor appointments. They always made it a point to make all of us comfortable.”",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Photo-1-scaled.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-10-01 11:56:55.451644

Studies have shown that autistic individuals respond positively to music and often show an increased interest in music making music therapy a great option for them.2 Many autistic and neurodivergent children are drawn to creative activities.

Music is a powerful tool and can have a major impact on brain function. Music therapy can help children with autism improve connections in their brain and it is a great complementary intervention that works well in conjunction with other therapies like occupational or physical.

Music therapy and learning to play an instrument are not the same things. And while they may have some overlapping benefits, the overall goals and techniques used are not the same.

If you are looking to build your child’s vocal skills or have them learn to play an instrument you would need to find a musical instructor, not a music therapist. However, with that being said, playing an instrument can be part of the therapy process, but learning to play the instrument is not the priority.",https://beaminghealth.com/ogimage.png,N,0.0,2025-10-01 05:56:50.472274

He and Trump repeatedly criticized the former Biden administration’s military policies and prioritization of diversity and inclusion efforts.
In another memo, Hegseth directs department watchdogs to use artificial intelligence as they seek to “expedite” oversight investigations.
Notably, in their remarks on Tuesday, both Hegseth and Trump underscored a need for immediate actions without specifying exact timelines for the initiatives.
During his 72-minute speech, the president also suggested that Hegseth “will soon be announcing major reforms to streamline military acquisitions and expedite” foreign military sales.","The Trump administration’s sweeping U.S. military shakeup is expected to gain momentum in the months to come — with more leadership changes, major acquisition updates and possible personnel cuts in the Pentagon’s pipeline, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested during an unusual gathering of military brass Tuesday.

At the “key leaders all-call” meeting with hundreds of top generals and admirals summoned from around the world at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Hegseth and President Donald Trump unveiled a broad docket of new and forthcoming directives meant to reflect their overarching vision for “woke”-ending reforms.

“We will not be politically correct when it comes to defending American freedom. We will be a fighting and winning machine. We want to fight, we want to win, and we want to fight as little as possible,” Trump said.

Theories swirled about the intent behind this mass gathering after Hegseth hastily ordered it last week.

In the portion that was publicly livestreamed, Hegseth outlined his plans for policy shifts — via 10 directives — around physical fitness and grooming standards, mandatory training, oversight processes, records retention rules and more.

Details on implementation were sparse, but some of those moves include mandating all combat arms positions to use the “highest male standard” in their physical fitness requirements; overhauling the inspector general process; launching a new department-wide review of physical standards; and banning beards except for people with temporary waivers, among others.

He and Trump repeatedly criticized the former Biden administration’s military policies and prioritization of diversity and inclusion efforts.

“I have fired a number of senior officers since taking over — the previous chairman, other members of the Joint Chiefs, combatant commanders and other commanders,” Hegseth noted. “It’s nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create or even benefited from that culture.”

More than 60,000 civilians voluntarily left their jobs within the department so far this year, through the Trump administration’s Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority offerings and other options. And as Hegseth noted, in the last few months the administration fired top military leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles “CQ” Brown, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, U.S. Cyber Command commander Gen. Timothy Haugh, and Defense Intelligence Agency director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, among others.

“More leadership changes will be made — of that, I’m certain. Not because we want to, but because we must. Once again, this is life and death. The sooner we have the right people, the sooner we can advance the right policies. Personnel is policy,” Hegseth said on Tuesday.

“If the words I’m speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” he told the crowd of senior officers.

Shortly after addressing the service members, the Pentagon chief signed several associated memorandums that outline the administration’s new proposals — including one that calls for a “cultural refresh” among the civilian workforce. In that issuance, Hegseth directed the department’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness “to immediately issue specific guidance” that will simultaneously encourage rewards for top performers and demystify the employee removal process. In another memo, Hegseth directs department watchdogs to use artificial intelligence as they seek to “expedite” oversight investigations.

Notably, in their remarks on Tuesday, both Hegseth and Trump underscored a need for immediate actions without specifying exact timelines for the initiatives.

“Enemies gather, threats grow. There is no time for games. We must be prepared. If we’re going to prevent and avoid war, we must prepare now. We are the ‘strength’ part of ‘peace through strength,’ and either we’re ready to win or we are not,” Hegseth said. “You see, this urgent moment, of course, requires more troops, more munitions, more drones, more Patriots, more submarines, more B-21 bombers. It requires more innovation, more AI in everything and, ahead of the curve, more cyber effects, more counter-UAS, more space, more speed.”

The secretary emphasized that the “War Department is tackling and prioritizing all of these things.” On that, Hegseth said he’ll give a speech next month “that will showcase the speed innovation and generational acquisition reforms we are undertaking urgently, and likewise, the nature of the threats we face in our hemisphere and in deterring China.”

Officially changing the name of the Department of Defense requires an act of Congress, but earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order rebranding DOD as the Department of War.

During his 72-minute speech, the president also suggested that Hegseth “will soon be announcing major reforms to streamline military acquisitions and expedite” foreign military sales.

“Together over the next few years, we’re going to make our military stronger, tougher, faster, fiercer and more powerful than it has ever been before,” Trump told the audience.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/09/Hegseth.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-30 18:56:28.852396

Those experiencing financial difficulties should contact their chain of command, who can provide more information on the financial aid organizations below.

Compensation:

The Military Leaders Economic Security Toolkit, located on the Military OneSource website, offers information and support. The site is updated regularly to reflect challenges and policy changes related to economic security.

Unemployment Benefits:

Furloughed employees are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits, but excepted employees working on a full-time basis are generally not eligible. Employees who wish to file should do so with the Unemployment Office for the state where the employee worked (i.e., last official duty station prior to furlough). Please be advised that when employees receive retroactive pay they will be required to pay back any unemployment benefits received in accordance with State law. For more information, see OPM guidance and the U.S. Department of Labor’s Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees.

Personal Financial Readiness:

The Military and Family Readiness Center personal financial readiness program sustains and improves financial literacy and readiness by offering information, education, training and free personal financial counseling to Airmen, Guardians and their families. The DAF has also increased the number of Personal Financial Managers available to assist and enhance financial readiness and money management skills for members and their families.

The Air Force Aid Society continues to support emergent needs such as basic living expenses (e.g., food, rent/mortgage, utilities), vehicle expenses (e.g., payments, repairs, insurance) and childcare costs. Airmen and Guardians can submit requests through local Military and Family Readiness Centers and Airman and Family Readiness Centers.

If Airmen, Guardians or their families are not near an aid organization, they may seek financial assistance from the Red Cross.

Several banking institutions, such as USAA, Navy Federal Credit Union and Marine Federal Credit Union, have been known to advance military pay to their customers during government shutdowns. Contact your bank to inquire about their policies for situations like these.

Food Insecurity:

First sergeants and Military and Family Readiness Centers assist Airmen, Guardians and their families in need of food security-related grants and loans with referrals to programs such as U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Federal Subsistence Supplemental Allowance program and the Air Force Aid Society.

The FY22 National Defense Authorization Act established a Basic Needs Allowance. The BNA Program provides supplemental income for military members and dependents whose gross household income falls below 200% of federal poverty guidelines.

TRICARE:

In response to the ongoing possibility of a government shutdown, the Defense Health Agency has authorized its TRICARE contractors to continue delivering health care to the 9.4 million beneficiaries of TRICARE. TRICARE beneficiaries seeking medical care from private providers should feel no significant effects. Care at military hospitals and clinics would remain largely unaffected. The TRICARE website includes current information about the impact of the shutdown on TRICARE health plans and military hospitals and clinics.

Overseas and Remote Commissaries:

Check status of local commissaries to determine the status of your local store. During a shutdown some non-appropriated fund services may continue to operate. Check with your local installation’s website to determine which services will remain open in your area. If able, plan ahead and minimize its impact on day-to-day routine.

“Government shutdowns are bad for national security and bad for Hampton Roads. That’s why I voted to keep the government open. The responsible, short-term measure House Republicans passed is designed to keep the government running while negotiations continue on year-long spending bills. Unfortunately, Democrats are demanding an additional $1.5 trillion in spending in exchange for just 30 days of government funding. This is unacceptable.

I firmly believe we must keep the government operational and working for Virginia’s Second District and our country while we work to resolve the broader spending issues. A government shutdown will disrupt critical programs that protect our national security, withhold pay from hardworking federal employees, and delay the ability of government agencies to serve the American people. House Republicans voted for clean CRs 13 times under President Biden. It’s time for Democrats to do the same—and to stop playing politics.

While this CR is only a short-term solution, it allows the full-year appropriations process to move forward and ensures federal agencies can continue serving our constituents without disruption. This spending bill is the most responsible and commonsense solution available to preserve this historically bipartisan process.

To ensure our servicemembers aren’t caught in the middle of this, I introduced the Pay Our Troops Act. This critical piece of legislation is designed to guarantee that our military personnel, including our Coast Guard, will continue to receive their paychecks during a shutdown, and I am hopeful it will be voted on soon.

Rohan Kulkarni, executive research leader for business consultancy HFS Research, told Healthcare Brew Omnicare’s bankruptcy filing didn’t come as a surprise given the size of the penalties the company was ordered to pay.
The bankruptcy likely won’t do much financial damage to CVS, Kulkarni said, as Omnicare makes up only a small portion of the overall company.
In its bankruptcy petition, Omnicare listed assets of between $100 million to $500 million and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.
Omnicare’s bankruptcy comes after a slew of changes to the retail pharmacy market, including competitor Walgreens selling to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in August.","“Bankruptcy” is becoming an all-too-familiar word in the pharmacy world.

CVS subsidiary Omnicare, which provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 22. The move comes a couple months after a judge ordered Omnicare to pay roughly $949 million in penalties for allegedly overcharging Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare (the federal insurer for the military) for prescription drugs.

It also comes a few months after pharmacy chain Rite Aid filed its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.

David Azzolina, Omnicare’s president, said in a press release announcing the bankruptcy filing that the penalty was “extreme” and potentially “unconstitutional.”

“Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,” Azzolina said. “There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it.”

Diving deeper. Rohan Kulkarni, executive research leader for business consultancy HFS Research, told Healthcare Brew Omnicare’s bankruptcy filing didn’t come as a surprise given the size of the penalties the company was ordered to pay.

The bankruptcy likely won’t do much financial damage to CVS, Kulkarni said, as Omnicare makes up only a small portion of the overall company. CVS doesn’t report financial results for Omnicare separately from its other subsidiaries, so the exact percentage is unclear, but based on the market’s reactions to both the lawsuit judgement and the bankruptcy news, Kulkarni estimated Omnicare makes up 3% to 4% of CVS’s total business.

After the judgement was announced, the stock dipped less than 1%, and after the bankruptcy news, the stock increased by about 1%.

However, the move could result in some reputational damage for the company, Kulkarni added.

“Over a period of time, CVS’s decision-making [and] CVS’s performance have indicated that they’re probably not really good at managing and operating a vertically integrated healthcare enterprise,” he said. “We’ve seen their challenges with Aetna. We’ve seen their challenges with some of their other lines of businesses.”

And while CVS executives said in the press release they’re considering selling Omnicare, Kulkarni said they’ll likely only do so when “the dust is settled” since the company’s value would be too low immediately following the bankruptcy news.

Kulkarni also said he expects some layoffs at Omnicare, “or some form of business process reengineering, some leadership shown the door.”

A look at the finances. In its bankruptcy petition, Omnicare listed assets of between $100 million to $500 million and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.

Omnicare executives said in the release that the company has secured $110 million to fund its operations through the bankruptcy process.

“Omnicare remains fully focused on meeting the pharmacy needs of its customers and long-term care residents,” the release stated.

Slavin told Healthcare Brew the company has no additional comment beyond the press release.

Many people wear a pink ribbon or pink clothes to raise breast cancer awareness. Let’s put another spin on bringing awareness to breast cancer prevention — eat pink! Let's explore how eating colorful, antioxidant-rich foods can support breast cancer prevention.

We're talking about foods rich in pink, red, and purple colors that are high in antioxidants, fiber, and phytonutrients — not cotton candy or bubble gum.

There is no sure way to prevent breast cancer. Many factors influence potential breast cancer risk over a lifetime. Some factors, such as getting older and family history, are things women can’t change. But we can lower the risk of breast cancer by taking care of our health.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers several recommendations for women to reduce their breast cancer risk:

Maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, and breastfeeding can help reduce the risk of breast cancer.

Limiting alcohol consumption and being aware of the risks associated with hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives are also important.

Understanding family history and discussing risk factors with a health care provider are crucial for determining appropriate breast cancer screening schedules.

Research on diet and prevention

Can diet specifically prevent breast cancer? No, but it is an important factor that we can control related to prevention. Healthy nutrition can make a difference in maintaining a healthy weight and decreasing the overall risk of cancer.

A meta-analysis of 48 research studies published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found no specific link for healthy eating styles to prevent breast cancer. However, the study found a diet high in vegetables, citrus fruit, mushrooms, and low-fat, calcium-rich dairy products was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. A diet higher in meat, red or processed meats, simple sugars, and eggs seems to be associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.

Post-diagnosis survival benefits

A separate study published in the scientific journal Nutrients found a diet pattern of high fiber, vegetables, fruit, nuts and olive oil might improve survival after diagnosis of breast cancer. This study found women can lower their breast cancer risk by living a healthy life, managing their weight, and eating well. When people don't move much, and eat too many unhealthy foods, their lifestyle often leads to obesity. Being obese can cause inflammation in body tissues, making it easier for breast cancer to develop and spread. This research study found obesity increases the risk of breast cancer after menopause and is also linked to the cancer’s return and a higher chance of death.

Power foods for prevention

Changing our diet is one of the factors we have control over; it can positively affect health and reduce the risk of cancer. Whether you're shopping at the commissary, eating at the dining facility, or meal prepping for the week, these colorful foods can easily fit into your busy military life.

Here’s a short list of foods that support “eat pink for breast cancer prevention” and the ways they can help prevent cancer:

Berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries): Packed with antioxidants and vitamins

Beets: Contain nitrates that may improve blood flow and lower blood pressure

Pomegranates: Rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds

Red/purple grapes: Contain resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant

Acai berries: Packed with antioxidants, available as a frozen packet, mixed with other fruit

Purple cabbage: A cruciferous vegetable with potential cancer-fighting properties

Red onions: Another source of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds

Pink grapefruit: Contains lycopene and other beneficial compounds; check for interactions with medications

Salmon: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may have protective health effects

Lentils (pink/red varieties): Good source of fiber and protein

Pink power plates

Engage friends and family with pink power plates by adding a splash of color to your meals. Swap out regular baked potatoes or french fries by baking or roasting purple sweet potatoes. Roasted, sliced beets are great additions to salads. Pomegranate seeds or berries can also be added to salads for color and variety. Sockeye salmon makes an easy, protein-rich entrée. Other ideas include making red cabbage slaw or a pink smoothie bowl with berries and dragon fruit. Eating the colors of the rainbow is a great way to get a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day!

Thinking pink is one way to help with overall health and wellness goals and breast cancer prevention. It is also important to prioritize screenings like mammograms, clinical breast exams, and, if applicable, genetic counseling for those at higher risk of breast cancer. TRICARE beneficiaries can find more information about breast cancer screenings and treatment options through the TRICARE website and the Defense Health Agency Virtual Education Center.

Talk to your primary care provider for more information about breast cancer prevention. For personalized nutrition advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

Margaret Rincon, Chief, Clinical Quality Improvement, at the Defense Health Agency. “Your feedback is valuable and would help craft the best evidence-based care pathway to treat service members and veterans for years to come.”

The focus group will meet virtually and last about two hours. It requires nine volunteers. The deadline to register is Friday, Oct. 10 at 5 p.m. ET.

Participation requirements

You must have a COPD diagnosis or be the caregiver of a person diagnosed with COPD.

You must be at least 18 years old.

You or the person you care for gets most of the care for this condition at a military hospital or clinic.

What to expect

During the virtual session, you’ll discuss your experiences in a small group led by a facilitator.

You’ll have the opportunity to review and comment on the final draft of the treatment guidelines. Note that the guideline won’t include any personally identifiable information.

How to register

Are you interested in signing up? Do you have more questions? Email the DHA CPG Group Mailbox at dha.ncr.medical-affairs.mbx.cqi-cpg@health.mil. Please indicate that you’re interested in the COPD focus group in your subject line.

The new program coined “Medical Right Start,” is an effort to educate Cannon’s Air Commandos and families on all things medical, according to Dr. (Lt. Col.) Rene Hinton, chief of medical staff at the 27 SOMDG. Providing our Airmen and their families with a baseline knowledge of medical care here at Cannon and the 27 SOMDG’s medical processes is a priority, she said.

The monthly briefing will be mandatory for all newcomers to Cannon, and will take place on the fourth Thursday of the month at the Base Theater, beginning at 9:00 a.m.

The new program is an initiative born from the Medical Support Summit Cannon AFB hosted in September 2023. The summit included: leaders from Air Force Special Operations Command, the state of New Mexico, the Defense Health Agency, the Department of the Air Force’s Surgeon General Office, the DAF Exceptional Family Member Program, and local medical community leaders, and aimed to tackle the challenges Airmen and their families face at Cannon AFB regarding access to specialty medical care. Since the summit, these leaders have come together to discuss improvements and ways forward for the 27 SOMDG periodically, with the goal of improving care for Airmen and families.

While Cannon AFB Airmen and families face unique challenges regarding access to specialty medical care, there are capabilities and benefits to assist them with these challenges. The new Medical Right Start program affords Airmen certainty that they have the ear of medical program leaders and have the correct point of contacts that will address their concerns directly. It aims to inform and educate the Airmen on how the 27 SOMDG provides support to overcome these challenges.

The Secretary of War said that there would be a male standard of fitness for all troops, stating that he was 'tired of seeing fat troops.'
When in doubt, assess the situation, follow your gut, and if it's best for the military, do it,' Hegseth said.
Hegseth asked his fellow officers to resign if they do not agree with his new military rules laid out during today's speech.
This includes removing top-level officials, renaming the Defense Department as the Department of War and slashing the number of generals by about about a quarter.","Secretary of War Pete Hegseth today fired a direct message to America's top generals: 'No more DEI, dudes in dresses, or gender delusion .... prepare for war.'

Speaking at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia, Hegseth said that America's enemies would 'FAFO', which stands for 'f*** around and find out,' if they chose to challenge its military might.

'From this moment forward the only mission of the newly restored Department of War is this: war fighting, preparing for war and preparing to win,' Hegseth continued, saying, however, that they do not wish for war, touting their 'strength through peace' motto.

What started as a pep talk turned into a list of new directives.

The Secretary of War said that there would be a male standard of fitness for all troops, stating that he was 'tired of seeing fat troops.' Hegseth also said these new rules are 'not about preventing women from serving.'

But he added that the physical standards needed to be gender neutral.

'If women can make it, excellent, if they cannot — then so be it ... it will also mean that weak men won't qualify. This is combat.'

Hegseth said standard training guidelines will be restored 'to what it should be — scary, tough disciplined,' and one where drill sergeants 'can put their hands on recruits.'

Hegseth slammed the political softening of the armed forces, including concerns over bullying and hazing, and wokeness.

'No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses, no more climate change worship, no more division, distraction or gender delusion, no more debris. I've said before and will say again, we are done with that s***,' the Secretary of War said.

Hegseth continued to lay out other directives. Notably, that each service will require high-level physical requirements, adding a combat arms field test.

Hegseth also issued new policies that would overhaul the Inspector General and the department’s equal employment opportunity office, overhauling a process that he says has been 'weaponized.'

'No more anonymous complaints, no more repeat complaints, smearing reputations, no more endless waiting or side-tracking careers,' Hegseth said.

Hegseth harped that the media has been obsessed over the number of firings the Secretary of War has made since taking over, adding that even more leadership changes will be made.

'My approach has been simple. When in doubt, assess the situation, follow your gut, and if it's best for the military, do it,' Hegseth said.

Hegseth asked his fellow officers to resign if they do not agree with his new military rules laid out during today's speech.

As Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth neared the conclusion of his speech at Quantico, he pointed to the Gulf War as an ideal blueprint for U.S. military engagement — a conflict where American forces, alongside coalition partners, swiftly repelled Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait in a matter of months.

Len Khodorkovsky, former deputy assistant secretary of state, tells Daily Mail that Hegseth wants to stay in line with the president’s MAGA lane, while cementing his own role, saying ‘everything is being recalibrated towards winning.’

‘It is a big recalibration in terms of what does it really take to lead in the 21st century and getting there. I think what you are seeing with Hegseth and his pentagon is connected to that idea. Let’s focus on the fundamentals, let’s focus on what our military is supposed to be doing and our warfighting capacity and name changes,’ Khodorkovsky said.

The secretive session has drawn concerns that pulling officers to one meeting could make the US vulnerable to a security threat.

'I think it is very concerning that you are pulling every single general and flag officer back to Quantico… that is a lot of people to pull from their duty stations,' a former defense official said. 'It would be very rare to have the combatant and deputy commander come into town and leave your station to be in town.'

A source close to Hegseth argued the Pentagon has taken safety precautions into account to ensure that their operations, like military bases, were not compromised.

'We hand–picked who would be in attendance, but nobody is reporting that,' the source close to Hegseth explained.

The order, first reported by the Washington Post, was sent to all of the military's top leadership worldwide earlier this week.

It comes months after Hegseth's Pentagon staff reported plans to slash the US military's senior ranks, cutting jobs held by about 100 admirals and generals.

Hegseth called that move necessary to cut 'redundant force structure' and continue streamlining the Pentagon's 'red-tape jungle.'

Roughly 800 generals and admirals are stationed across the US and around the world, spanning numerous countries and time-zones.

The new directive comes after several significant changes Hegseth implemented, as he attempts to restructure the department.

This includes removing top-level officials, renaming the Defense Department as the Department of War and slashing the number of generals by about about a quarter.

The recent dismissals are part of a continuing sweep through the upper echelons of the country's top defense leadership.

Hegseth has frequently slammed high-ranking military officials, expressing his views in podcasts last year. He has said that about one-third of the top brass are deliberately trying to turning the military into a political tool.

Sources tell Daily Mail that Hegseth reportedly fears for his safety after the Charlie Kirk assassination. Two insiders in the defense secretary's department say their boss has been raging at staffers and obsessing over issues relating to his security.

Both sources spoke to Daily Mail on the condition of anonymity, saying they were worried they could lose their jobs at a time when Hegseth has been slashing the department roles, and firing Pentagon officials.

The bill requires the Department of War (DoW) to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect. Notices must be delivered electronically and supported by a proactive outreach campaign through TRICARE’s website, social media, and family readiness groups.

Rep. Kiggans said, “As a Navy veteran and Mom, I know firsthand how critical it is for servicemembers, retirees, and their families to have reliable access to healthcare. Too often, families are caught off guard by coverage changes that create confusion, gaps in care, or unexpected costs. This bipartisan bill ensures TRICARE beneficiaries get repeated, clear reminders, well in advance, so they can plan, budget, and make informed decisions.”

Rep. Ryan said, “Military families have sacrificed so much for this country—it’s absolutely unacceptable that their coverage can be ripped away without notice. It’s entirely un-American. This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them. Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

Rep. Wittman said, “Our military families and retirees deserve the best—which includes transparency and clarity about changes to their healthcare. Too often, changes in coverage come with too little notice, jeopardizing the well-being of recipients and putting undue stress on families. I’m proud to cosponsor the TRICARE Transition Transparency Act, bipartisan legislation that will deliver for military families and retirees by ensuring they receive clear and punctual notice of changes to their TRICARE coverage.”

Rep. Goodlander said, “America’s military families sacrifice every day for our country. But right now under our laws, basic healthcare can be ripped away from them without notice. That is dead wrong. And our bipartisan bill will right this wrong.”

“The TRICARE Transition Transparency Act will ensure military families are notified when approaching life events that trigger changes in TRICARE eligibility. TRICARE is a complex benefit and awareness of pending eligibility changes is key to ensuring seamless coverage and access to health care. MOAA appreciates Rep. Kiggans’ leadership on this important legislation, and we look forward to supporting her efforts to improve TRICARE communication to military families,” said MOAA President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret).

Background:

Under current rules, dependent children lose regular TRICARE eligibility at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in school). Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570/month for TYA Prime and $300/month for TYA Select.

At age 65, beneficiaries must enroll in Medicare Part B to maintain TRICARE for Life coverage, a requirement many retirees learn about too late.

These transitions often come with little advance notice, leading to missed enrollment windows, coverage gaps, and higher out-of-pocket expenses.

Act 624, however, went much further.
§ 1103, expressly preempts any state law that obstructs “health care delivery” under TRICARE.
The speed with which Act 624 was enjoined should serve as a warning beyond Arkansas.
Act 624, for all its stated good intentions, was an unconstitutional attempt to advantage local businesses by walling off competition.","When Arkansas lawmakers rushed through Act 624 this spring, they cast it as a bold defense of independent pharmacies. The law prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)—the intermediaries that negotiate prices with drug manufacturers, manage insurance formularies, and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions—from owning pharmacies or having common ownership with Arkansas pharmacies. While this may have seemed like a win for locally owned businesses, barely sixty days later a federal court enjoined it as unconstitutional, setting it up to likely be dismantled.

Fundamental flaws in the law are what led a judge to stop the law swiftly in its tracks. By attempting to bar national PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies, Arkansas tried to do in statute what the Constitution forbids: erect economic barriers against out-of-state commerce and usurp federal authority over military health benefits. Those twin defects—protectionism at the state level and intrusion into the federal domain—made Act 624 vulnerable the moment it was signed, something that should give pause to legislators elsewhere contemplating similar measures.

The business models of PBMs have long drawn scrutiny in Arkansas. Because many are vertically integrated—operating specialty pharmacies or sharing common ownership with large retail chains—lawmakers in recent years have adopted targeted legislation to address reimbursement practices and prohibit steering prescriptions to their related pharmacy, while the state’s insurance department has enacted additional transparency mandates.

Act 624, however, went much further. Rather than instituting additional rules about how PBMs interact with independent pharmacies, the bill categorically banned them and their affiliates from holding pharmacy permits in the state. Effectively, this required PBMs to close or divest themselves of their affiliated pharmacies by January 2026.

Arkansas defended the law as a structural safeguard against conflicts of interest, but the district court’s injunction made clear why such a sweeping measure could not stand. With regard to violations of the Commerce Clause, the judge concluded that Act 624 “appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out-of-state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests.”

As the court observed, “the legislative history of [Act 624] is brimming with protectionist rhetoric.” The statute itself states that its purpose is to eliminate “business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business.” And even though Arkansas already had narrower laws that addressed those same policy concerns, they pressed forward with Act 624 which imposed an “excessive” burden on interstate commerce when “less burdensome means” were readily available.

The law also ran headlong into the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. TRICARE, the federal program providing health coverage for nearly 40,000 residents in Arkansas, contracts with PBM-owned and affiliated pharmacies to deliver mail-order and specialty drugs. Act 624 would have forced those facilities to close, directly interfering with federal operations. But 10 U.S.C. § 1103, expressly preempts any state law that obstructs “health care delivery” under TRICARE. The court found Act 624 “both explicitly and impliedly preempted” because it not only gives state regulators the right to veto which companies TRICARE may use to deliver pharmacy benefits but it also undermines the “stability,” “uniformity,” and “national” character of the program.

The speed with which Act 624 was enjoined should serve as a warning beyond Arkansas. Legislators in states as across the country have already signaled interest in pursuing similar bans, and others may follow when their sessions convene but they should not repeat the mistake Arkansas made. The constitutional roadmap is clear. Laws animated by protectionist intent will be struck down under the Commerce Clause. And, measures that let state officials interfere with the operation of federal programs will not be allowed to stand. The only certainty such statutes create is expensive litigation, prolonged uncertainty, and likely defeat.

Act 624, for all its stated good intentions, was an unconstitutional attempt to advantage local businesses by walling off competition. It should be overturned and other states should resist the temptation to follow its example. Protectionist pharmacy bans are not only bad policy but bad law. Legislatures should take the lesson now: good intentions cannot rescue unconstitutional statutes, and bad policy dressed as reform is destined to collapse under judicial scrutiny.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/58/588105_6_.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-09-30 12:57:03.305629

The extension is for a period of performance from Sept. 30, 2025, through Sept. 29, 2026.

“The Department recognizes the vital contributions of our civilian workforce abroad,” said Anthony J. Tata, the undersecretary of war for personnel and readiness. “Extending this pilot ensures continued support for our employees and reflects the Department’s unwavering commitment to taking care of our people who are supporting crucial military missions in Japan.”

The pilot program offers access to a bilingual call center that assists participants with appointment scheduling, medical provider coordination, and upfront payment guarantees. Eligibility requires enrollment in a participating Federal Employees Health Benefits plan, with non-appropriated fund employees qualifying through Aetna International coverage.

A recent evaluation determined the pilot program addressed many concerns and barriers to care, including issues related to billing. In the first eight months of the pilot, over 829 people contacted the call center for assistance, and DOW civilians avoided upfront, out-of-pocket costs for medical care while their claims were processed.

Beneficiaries noted the pilot’s positive impacts. “The International SOS program was a life-changing moment for me as the employee. I'm able to now get health care,” said one employee. Another commented that, “This [the pilot program] has made getting seen with health care in a foreign country easy and seamless.”

The new interpreter support came about as a result of direct feedback from participants. Interpreter services will now be included, subject to their availability, in the next period of performance. The second year of the pilot will continue to monitor participant feedback and utilization rates to determine if the contract will expand to include dependents of DOW civilians.

The extension will continue to be administered by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Affairs, in partnership with International SOS Government Services Inc., the support contractor for the TRICARE Overseas Program. The $4.2 million contract extension is funded by participating military departments and defense agencies.

Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of war for health services policy and oversight, emphasized the program’s impact: “This supplemental service has already improved the patient experience for our civilians in Japan by helping over 829 individuals navigate their medical care. We’re pleased to continue offering this vital support.”

Further details, including updated enrollment information and program enhancements, will be released ahead of the upcoming Federal Benefits Open Season, which starts Nov. 11, 2025.",https://www.health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/DVIDS/Photo-Items/image9346275.jpg?sc_lang=en&hash=FC9CD13AD9919EC4812088EE3D6C8AC14E2BDD9B,N,0.0,2025-09-30 08:56:37.799045

Expanded eligibility for young adults, new protections for survivors, and a reshuffling of regional plans are already reshaping how families access care. For military families, understanding these updates is essential to maintaining coverage and exploring better options.

One of the most talked-about developments involved young adult dependents. Currently, TRICARE coverage for children ends at age 21, or 23 if they’re enrolled full-time in college. Beyond that, families often turn to TRICARE Young Adult (TYA), a premium-based plan that can hit some households with monthly fees of several hundred dollars. In 2025, that premium reached $337 per month for TRICARE Select, while Prime costs soared to $727 per month – a stark contrast to civilian plans covering youth up to age 26 at no additional cost.

To bridge the gap, lawmakers introduced the bipartisan Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, which would extend TRICARE dependent coverage to age 26 at no extra cost. Its backers include Senator Kelly, Murkowski, and Warren, and Representatives Ryan and Kiggans. If passed, this reform would align military families with typical civilian health insurance standards. It is currently gaining momentum as more families share the financial burden of exorbitant premiums.

In addition to age-related reforms, TRICARE is also refining how coverage works after a sponsor dies for a narrow group of beneficiaries. Starting on October 1, 2025, survivors of non-activated National Guard or Reserve members will be able to continue or purchase TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) coverage for up to three years following the sponsor’s death, an update intended to ease the transition to survivor benefits.

Another significant change affecting families is the reshuffling of TRICARE regions. Beginning on January 1, 2025, six states – to include Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin – switched from the East to the West Region. Since the West Region is now managed by TriWest Healthcare Alliance rather than Health Net, families were required to take action: anyone paying via bank transfer or credit card had to resubmit their payment to TriWest before the end of the year, or risk losing coverage. Those using military allotment payments did not need to act. These region changes promise benefits such as streamlined referrals, broader telehealth access, and a stronger provider network.

Looking ahead to 2026, TRICARE will pilot a new type of Prime plan in Atlanta and Tampa under a demonstration project with CareSource Military & Veterans. Starting January 2026, eligible family members will gain access to a managed-care-style option that eliminates referrals and introduces a dedicated provider network. Retirees and families in these regions will have enrollment fees waived for the first year, after which standard Bronze Prime rates apply. They’ll also benefit from services like 24/7 nurse advice, virtual care, and care coordination, but they must still rely on military facilities for emergencies.

Putting it all together, 2025 delivered meaningful, although incremental, gains for military families. Young adults may soon enjoy longer access to affordable health care. Surviving dependents gain a buffer through expanded coverage. Regional health networks are shifting, forcing administrative attention but offering improved access. Next year’s pilot programs in major metro areas could lay the groundwork for more flexible care options nationwide.

For today’s military families, close attention and proactive follow-through remain vital. Dependent families should monitor TRICARE announcements, stay current in DEERS, submit required payments on time, and see if their young adults qualify for extended coverage. If you’re in Atlanta or Tampa and want to change plans, open season late this year is your opportunity. All of these changes underscore a system in motion which, when navigated well, can better meet the evolving needs of servicemembers and their dependents.

Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans should continue to be obligated and disbursed during a federal shutdown, but only as long as carryover and mandatory appropriations last.
Free Applications for Student Aid (FAFSA), Pell Grant, and Federal Direct Student Loans, and servicing of federal student loans should continue for a “very limited time” under a shutdown.
If a shutdown continues for an extended period of time, school districts, colleges, and universities may begin to experience funding shortages due to lapsed federal funding.
During previous federal shutdowns, taxpayer phone calls, taxpayer disputes and tax refunds were delayed.","Posted 9/29/2025

Funding for the federal government currently expires on September 30. That means that absent new legislation passed by Congress and signed into law, the federal government will enter a shutdown beginning at 12:01 AM on Wednesday October 1, 2025.

I am in Washington, ready to vote and working to keep critical services up and running for families in our community while lowering health care costs. Sadly, Republicans are continuing to push a partisan spending bill that takes health care away from working families.

Without action by President Trump and Congress, many Affordable Care Act tax credits will expire at the end of the year. Approximately 38,000 people in our district could see their premiums increase by hundreds of dollars per year, beginning in 2026.

Government Shutdown Information: What You Need to Know

In the event of a government shutdown, my DC and district offices will be available to assist you and your family.Our constituent services will continue, however there may be delays in processing casework due to agency policies. To help you plan for a possible federal government shutdown, my office has prepared answers to these frequently asked questions. You can also contact my office at 202-225-7032 or 216-522-4900.

Note: the summary below is based on previous shutdowns. The Trump Administration has not released formal guidance on current agency plans. My office is monitoring developments closely and calling on the Trump Administration to follow existing law regarding a lapse in appropriations.

Will I continue to receive my Social Security and SSI checks?

Recipients will continue to receive their Social Security and SSI checks. The Social Security Administration (SSA) will continue providing limited services like issuing Social Security cards and holding appointments for benefit applications. However, SSA will stop activities like benefit verifications and processing overpayments and the public will likely experience increased wait times for customer service.

Will Medicare and Medicaid benefits be affected?

Medicare, Medicaid and disability insurance will be largely unaffected by a shutdown lasting less than three months. Current beneficiaries will continue to receive their benefits.

What will happen with SNAP and WIC?

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) will quickly run out of funding and be unable to provide food for children and parents in need. In the case of a prolonged shutdown, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may also be affected.

What is the impact on veterans' services?

All Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities and clinics will remain fully operational. The VA will continue to process veterans’ benefits.

Will military and federal retiree benefits be suspended?

Military and federal retirees will continue to receive their retirement benefits. Processing new applications or other requested changes will be delayed.

Which federal employees keep working during a government shutdown?

When the government shuts down, federal agencies are required to classify their employees whose salaries have lapsed as either ""excepted"" or ""not excepted."" The employees classified as ""excepted"" work without pay during the shutdown. The employees classified as ""not excepted"" are put on unpaid furlough. Under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, all federal employees must be retroactively paid for the duration of the shutdown upon its conclusion.

What is the impact on U.S. military personnel and federal law enforcement?

In previous shutdowns, all active-duty and Guard and Reservists on active-duty orders were excepted and therefore are required to work. On-base non-acute health care ceased, but off-base care provided through Tricare was not impacted. On-base child care was open on a case-by-case basis. Federal law enforcement was also required to work. Both federal law enforcement and military personnel will not be paid until after the shutdown is over.

Will mail still be delivered?

Yes. The U.S. Postal Service is not affected by a shutdown.

Will commercial air travel be affected?

In prior shutdowns, air traffic controllers, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents remained on the job. However, like all federal employees, they will not be paid until the shutdown is over.

What is the impact on small businesses?

In prior shutdowns, the Small Business Administration (SBA) stopped processing new business loans, such as through the 7(a) and 504 programs. However, SBA’s Disaster Loan Program continued regular operations.

What is the impact on federal housing loans?

In prior shutdowns, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) stopped insuring some new mortgages and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) stopped processing some new loans. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) also stopped new loan and loan guarantee activity. The VA will continue to guarantee home loans.

What is the impact on student loans?

Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans should continue to be obligated and disbursed during a federal shutdown, but only as long as carryover and mandatory appropriations last. The department staff needed to carry out these functions are significantly reduced during a shutdown. Free Applications for Student Aid (FAFSA), Pell Grant, and Federal Direct Student Loans, and servicing of federal student loans should continue for a “very limited time” under a shutdown. If a shutdown continues for an extended period of time, school districts, colleges, and universities may begin to experience funding shortages due to lapsed federal funding.

What happens with passport and immigration applications?

Visa and passport operations are fee-funded and not normally impacted by a shutdown. Immigration court cases on the detained docket should still proceed during a lapse in congressional appropriations while non-detained docket cases will be reset for a later date when funding resumes. In past shutdowns the Department of Homeland Security has continued Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement staffing and operations. All services at international embassies and consulates should continue during a shutdown. If you are abroad and need help, you can contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.

What is the impact on disaster relief efforts?

FEMA staff will still respond to emergencies. In prior shutdowns, long-term projects were delayed due to a lack of funding in the Disaster Relief Fund.

What is the impact on food safety activities?

In prior shutdowns, some Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety activities — such as routine inspections of facilities — were delayed.

Will tax refunds be delayed?

During previous federal shutdowns, taxpayer phone calls, taxpayer disputes and tax refunds were delayed.

Do national parks and monuments close?

To date, NPS guidance has not been released. National Park closures will be determined on a location-by-location basis; open-air parks and monuments in Washington, D.C. will likely remain accessible. Smithsonian museums may also be impacted by a lengthy shutdown. Many services and facilities could be impacted – including visitor centers, educational programs, restrooms, trash collection, and road maintenance. There would also be limited emergency/rescue services and safety updates would not be published. Please keep this in mind when planning any visits to national parks.",http://shontelbrown.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/shontelbrown.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/2025-01-07_bt_1323.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-09-29 20:56:37.349575

Tata, the undersecretary of war for personnel and readiness. “Extending this pilot ensures continued support for our employees and reflects the Department’s unwavering commitment to taking care of our people who are supporting crucial military missions in Japan.”

The pilot program offers access to a bilingual call center that assists participants with appointment scheduling, medical provider coordination, and upfront payment guarantees. Eligibility requires enrollment in a participating Federal Employees Health Benefits plan, with non-appropriated fund employees qualifying through Aetna International coverage.

A recent evaluation determined the pilot program addressed many concerns and barriers to care, including issues related to billing. In the first eight months of the pilot, over 829 people contacted the call center for assistance, and DOW civilians avoided upfront, out-of-pocket costs for medical care while their claims were processed.

Beneficiaries noted the pilot’s positive impacts. “The International SOS program was a life-changing moment for me as the employee. I'm able to now get health care,” said one employee. Another commented that, “This [the pilot program] has made getting seen with health care in a foreign country easy and seamless.”

The new interpreter support came about as a result of direct feedback from participants. Interpreter services will now be included, subject to their availability, in the next period of performance. The second year of the pilot will continue to monitor participant feedback and utilization rates to determine if the contract will expand to include dependents of DOW civilians.

The extension will continue to be administered by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Affairs, in partnership with International SOS Government Services Inc., the support contractor for the TRICARE Overseas Program. The $4.2 million contract extension is funded by participating military departments and defense agencies.

Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of war for health services policy and oversight, emphasized the program’s impact: “This supplemental service has already improved the patient experience for our civilians in Japan by helping over 829 individuals navigate their medical care. We’re pleased to continue offering this vital support.”

Further details, including updated enrollment information and program enhancements, will be released ahead of the upcoming Federal Benefits Open Season, which starts Nov. 11, 2025.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9346275/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-29 20:56:42.491956
,,2025-09-29 23:16:18+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,How would a government shutdown impact the U.S. military? - CBS News,Eleanor  Watson,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-impact-u-s-military/,"During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over.
Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or ""excepted,"" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.
Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the ""Pay Our Military Act,"" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.
During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October.
During the shutdown, medical care and dental care would be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness.","Unless Congress comes to a funding deal ahead of October 1, the government will shut down, forcing active-duty service members to continue to serve without pay until a deal is made.

During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or ""excepted,"" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.

""After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,"" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the ""Pay Our Military Act,"" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.

Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the ""Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,"" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it's unlikely to pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.

During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a press release it would ""offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support."" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a ""no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.""

The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.

The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.

While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.

During the shutdown, medical care and dental care would be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness.

Lawrence, Drew Lawrence",,,,,https://taskandpurpose.com/news/gambling-addiction-troops/,"The military could do a better job at helping service members with gambling addictions, according to a government watchdog report released last week, as a growing body of research suggests that troops and veterans may be more susceptible to the disorder.
While the Defense Department offers treatment for troops diagnosed with a gambling disorder, officials told the GAO that the military does not have specialized care for it.
Because assessments are based on self-reported cases of gambling abuse, the prevalence of the issue may be much greater, the report said.
Now you’ve created apps that are addictive,” Mark Lucia, a program manager at Kindbridge Research Institute, which studies gambling disorders in the military, previously told Task & Purpose.
The GAO report said that DHA survey response rates for gambling disorders were less than five percent.","The military could do a better job at helping service members with gambling addictions, according to a government watchdog report released last week, as a growing body of research suggests that troops and veterans may be more susceptible to the disorder.

In a 19-page finding, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said that the services are inconsistent in their gambling prevention methods, and that the Department of Defense should clearly define roles and responsibilities for staff to help curb the issue.

Multiple academic studies have reported that gambling addiction is on the rise as a whole since the legalization of state-sponsored sports betting in 2018. A 2021 Rutgers University study found that troops were at an increased risk of gambling abuse, given a young military population, the prevalence of risk-taking, stress and other factors that make it more likely for service members to develop the disorder.

While the Defense Department offers treatment for troops diagnosed with a gambling disorder, officials told the GAO that the military does not have specialized care for it. Because assessments are based on self-reported cases of gambling abuse, the prevalence of the issue may be much greater, the report said.

Based on available data from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the report found that 185 troops self-reported a gambling-related diagnosis last year. That’s up about 30 percent from 2019.

In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that states could authorize sports betting and since then, online and app-based sports betting has exploded in America. Experts have said that troops can easily fall into a troublesome gambling pit.

“You are a risk taker. You’re competitive. It lines up perfectly. Now you’ve created apps that are addictive,” Mark Lucia, a program manager at Kindbridge Research Institute, which studies gambling disorders in the military, previously told Task & Purpose. But he added that “we don’t have anything that even offers something remotely that looks like a smoking gun, that this is a huge issue.”

Notably, the GAO report said that recreational establishments owned by the military operate slot machines around the world, with some services raking in tens of millions of dollars a year that then go back to funding recreational programs.

However, military officials told the GAO that retirees, contractors and family members primarily use these machines, and that anecdotal evidence suggested that active duty troops were attracted to commercial gambling options, especially online.

The military issued a policy in January addressing “problematic substance use and gambling disorder,” but the GAO report said that it did not adequately assign oversight for its implementation or specific staff responsible for preventing, assessing, diagnosing and treating the issue.

Top Stories This Week

The DHA is expected to issue the first of what will become an annual report next year, the GAO report said, which aims to track prevalence and trends among service members when it comes to gambling.

Meanwhile, Task & Purpose previously reported that owners of sports betting apps such as FanDuel, BetMGM and DraftKings were calling for more research into gambling abuse, the latter of which announced in 2023 it would be funding research into the disorder among veterans.

Experts in behavioral science acknowledged that limited treatment and reporting for this specific disorder has made it difficult to study. The GAO report said that DHA survey response rates for gambling disorders were less than five percent. On top of that, service members must receive a diagnosis of a gambling disorder to receive care, which is likely a tall order in an organization that has long struggled to overcome its stigma in seeking care for mental health issues overall.

The recommendations from the GAO were directed at all of the services and generally called for them to update policy to be more in line with the recently-released DoD directive from January.",https://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1430548801-e1751556352205.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-09-29 18:56:19.442188

“Getting vaccinated against influenza each year is the best way to protect yourself, your family, and your community,” said 1st Lt. Kennedy Reeves, a public health nurse and chief of Munson’s Department of Public Health. “Flu can lead to serious illness, hospitalization, or even death, especially among young children, older adults, and those with certain medical conditions.”

Reeves added that influenza viruses change from year to year, making annual vaccination important. The flu vaccine reduces the risk of infection, and for those who do become ill, it can lessen the severity and duration of symptoms.

Common symptoms of influenza include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and fatigue. Complications may include pneumonia, worsening of chronic medical conditions, and in some cases, life-threatening outcomes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual flu vaccination for everyone six months and older, unless otherwise advised by a healthcare provider.

(2023).","Having a strong social network helps support your psychological health and keeps you mission ready. Feeling connected is especially important during tough times. However, frequent moves and deployments can make it hard to maintain close relationships. Fortunately, positive social media use can help you keep up with friends and family and get or give support when the going gets tough.

POSITIVE SOCIAL MEDIA USE

The following are positive ways you can use social media to support psychological health:

Stay in touch with loved ones: this is especially important on deployment. Use social media to exchange updates. This can give you and your family a sense of comfort. It can also remind you to stay strong for those you care about.

Find support during tough times: if you are struggling, you can use social media and apps to locate important psychological health resources.

Settle in a new location: moves can be challenging for you and your family. Fortunately, using social media can help you learn about a new area. You can find entertainment and services, learn about community events, and join social groups. This can help your family quickly find a sense of belonging

Stay up to date on base and unit information: many installations and units have their own social media pages. These pages can help you learn about events, emergencies, deployments and more.

Support fellow warriors: You may be the first line of support for fellow service members who are struggling. Share helpful resources on your social media profiles. Keep an eye out for posts that could mean a member of the military community, friend, family member is struggling. Reach out to support them. Even sharing something sympathetic can let them know you have their back.

GETTING CARE

Social media can help you locate resources and connect with care. The social connections you forge can even help you cope during difficult times and support your recovery after traumatic events. However, social media is never a replacement for formal care. If you have psychological health concerns because of your military service or home life, talk to a psychological health care provider. Connect with a provider by visiting your nearest military hospital or clinic. To locate care in your area, use TRICARE's hospital and clinic finder (https://www.tricare.mil/GettingCare/FindDoctor/mtf) or call the MHS Nurse Advice Line at 1-800-TRICARE (874-2273) and press 1.

STAYING SAFE ON SOCIAL MEDIA

Even though social media has many benefits, you should be mindful of personal and operational security while using it:

-Stay informed of Defense Department, branch and unit policies.

-Update your operating system and web browser.

-Avoid sharing details like specific dates or locations.

-Be wary of mobile apps that mark or record your location.

-Stay current on privacy policies for each of the social networks you use.

-Keep electronics locked when not in use.

-Guard your passwords and change them frequently.

If you are feeling distress as the result of military service or other life stress, reach out for help. You can contact the Psychological Health Resource Center 24/7 at 866-966-1020 or use the live chat (https://home-c72.niceincontact.com/incontact/chatclient/index.html) to confidentially speak with trained health resource consultants.

,,2025-09-29 11:03:05+00:00,Snopes,Contextualizing claims Trump deployed National Guard on 29-day orders to avoid paying benefits,Rae Deng,,,,,https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/09/29/trump-national-guard-29-days/,"As of this writing, there have been two major National Guard deployments set into motion by Trump in 2025.
Daniel Szarek, a spokesperson for the Mississippi National Guard, said via email that the ""claims you are referencing are factually inaccurate.""
On Reddit, various users of the National Guard subreddit joked about being put on 29-day orders in the district.
In sum … There is no concrete evidence the Trump administration has been repeatedly activating National Guard members on 29-day orders to avoid paying benefits to them.
In the District of Columbia, where Trump both deployed the district's guard and requested governors send their own states' guard members, the situation is more complicated.","In 2025, a claim circulated online that U.S. President Donald Trump had repeatedly deployed the National Guard on 29-day cycles to avoid paying out housing and health benefits that activate after 30 days.

The rumor spread on X, Facebook and Instagram. Snopes readers also wrote in to ask whether it was true.

This claim needs context. While it is true that sending the National Guard on a 29-day order can skirt requirements to pay out full benefits, this is a common practice in the guard, according to legitimate news reports.

As of this writing, there have been two major National Guard deployments set into motion by Trump in 2025. In the first instance, when Trump sent the California National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles in June, soldiers received full benefits starting from their first day on active duty due to U.S. law about federal activation, according to the California Military Department.

In the second instance, when Trump deployed the guard to Washington, D.C., ""for the purpose of restoring law and order,"" he actually did so in two ways: He requested governors of other states to send their own National Guard to the district, and he sent the D.C. National Guard, which reports directly to the president, unlike the National Guard in states.

A spokesperson for Joint Task Force — District of Columbia, the mission in charge of the deployment, said that for the purposes of that specific mobilization, ""no service member was intentionally placed on an order of 29 days or less for the purpose of avoiding the allowance or entitlements for which they are entitled.""

""While exceptions may exist, the majority of service members are mobilized on orders extending beyond 30 days, ensuring they qualify for full benefits,"" the spokesperson said via email, adding that states that sent their guard members to D.C. would be responsible for their benefits.

Given the complex nature of this claim, we have not rated it. Here's what we know:

The 29-day limit did not apply to LA

Under federal law, members of the ""reserve components"" of U.S. military — which includes the National Guard — are obligated to the same rate of ""basic allowance for housing"" that regular military members receive under certain circumstances, detailed here:

(4) The rate of basic allowance for housing to be paid to the following members of a reserve component shall be equal to the rate in effect for similarly situated members of a regular component of the uniformed services:

(A) A member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days.

(B) A member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of 30 days or less in support of a contingency operation.

Similar rules apply for health care coverage.

In other words, members of the guard receive full benefits only when called to active duty for more than 30 days or for a ""contingency operation,"" legally defined either as a deployment by the secretary of defense against ""an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military force"" or an activation after the president declares a national emergency or war.

When Trump deployed the California National Guard, he did so under a ""Title 10"" contingency operation, which is when the president calls in the National Guard due to invasion, rebellion, ""danger of a rebellion"" or because the president is ""unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."" That means that regardless of the number of days the guard was deployed, soldiers received full benefits from their first day on active duty, as confirmed by an emailed statement from the California Military Department.

""About 4,300 Soldiers served on this activation and received the same benefits,"" the department said. ""In this case, Soldiers were entitled to full benefits—including housing allowance—from their first day on active duty, regardless of whether their orders were for one day or several months.""

Did the 29-day limit apply to the National Guard in DC?

Unlike in California, Trump's activation of the D.C. National Guard did not fall under Title 10 federal activation because the district's guard answers directly to the president rather than to a governor because the district does not have one. As previously stated, a spokesperson for the joint task force said the Trump administration activated the ""majority"" of the guard under orders lasting more than 30 days.

In a Sept. 4, 2025, X post, Brig. Gen. Leland D. Blanchard II, interim commanding general for the D.C. task force, said he extended the encampment in part to ensure ""Guard members and families retain their activation benefits.""

Guard members from outside states deployed to D.C. by their governors on request of the president ""remain under the administrative control of their home states,"" according to the joint task force spokesperson.

""D.C. Guard works hand-in-hand with those states to ensure every Guard member is paid, supported, and cared for,"" the spokesperson said.

At least six states, all Republican-controlled, have also sent their own National Guard to the district by request of the president: Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Dakota and West Virginia.

Only Mississippi, Georgia and South Dakota responded to inquiries from Snopes. In response to our question about 29-day orders, Georgia National Guard provided a generic statement detailing its support for the D.C. mission and said other questions should go to the task force. South Dakota directed all questions to the task force. Daniel Szarek, a spokesperson for the Mississippi National Guard, said via email that the ""claims you are referencing are factually inaccurate.""

""Our Mississippi Guardsmen are not deployed on 29-day orders and are receiving the benefits they are entitled to,"" Szarek said.

On Reddit, various users of the National Guard subreddit joked about being put on 29-day orders in the district. We filed a records request in an attempt to determine how common these orders were in comparison with the longer orders and await a response.

Many Redditors in the National Guard subreddit also alleged that being put on 29-day orders to avoid paying out benefits has been a common tactic used in the guard long before the Trump administration — although no user felt comfortable providing their name to Snopes for verification due to fear of retaliation. We reached out to a litany of experts and universities with defense studies programs to confirm the frequency of 29-day orders and will update this story if we receive additional information from them.

In sum …

There is no concrete evidence the Trump administration has been repeatedly activating National Guard members on 29-day orders to avoid paying benefits to them. In fact, when the president deployed the California National Guard in June, guard members received full benefits from the first day of work as required by federal law.

In the District of Columbia, where Trump both deployed the district's guard and requested governors send their own states' guard members, the situation is more complicated. According to the joint task force overseeing the deployment in D.C., the Trump administration did not purposefully send anyone out on 29-day orders, and the majority of guard members have received orders lasting more than 30 days, ensuring full benefits. However, it was unclear whether any states' governors have sent their guard members on 29-day orders to the district; only Mississippi's National Guard responded to an inquiry about it and stated that its members are receiving full benefits.",https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2025/09/national_guard.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-29 07:56:31.962360

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently released a report highlighting the increasing cases of gambling disorders among U.S. military service members. Despite this growing issue, the Pentagon has yet to establish effective solutions or support systems for affected personnel.

Young Service Members and Risky Gambling Behavior

The GAO report points out that younger members of the military are particularly susceptible to gambling, often driven by a tendency to take greater risks. This demographic trend raises concerns about their vulnerability to developing gambling-related problems.

Lack of Leadership and Coordination in Addressing Gambling Disorders

Although procedures to identify and manage gambling disorders among military staff have been updated, the GAO found that no specific individual or office has been designated to lead these efforts. This lack of coordination hinders effective intervention and support for those affected.

Current Diagnosis Rates and Possible Underreporting

In 2024, there were 185 military personnel formally diagnosed with gambling disorders. However, Kristy Williams, the GAO’s Director of Defense Capabilities and Management, emphasized that this number might not fully capture the extent of the problem. Many individuals may not seek medical help, or their symptoms might not meet the official diagnostic criteria, resulting in potential underreporting.

Recommendations for Improved Support Systems

The GAO proposed nine recommendations aimed at enhancing the Pentagon’s approach to preventing, identifying, and treating gambling disorders among service members. The Defense Health Agency and various military branches are encouraged to revise their policies to better address this issue.

Funding Challenges and Lack of Preventive Measures

Financial support for programs related to service member welfare often comes from revenues generated by slot machines located at military bases outside the United States. These funds assist with morale, childcare, and infrastructure programs. However, the GAO report notes that there are no current initiatives in place at these locations to deter gambling problems or support those struggling with gambling disorders.

Key Findings on Gambling Behaviors and Mental Health

The 2024 study revealed that approximately 4.7% of surveyed personnel admitted to lying about gambling or feeling compelled to increase their bets. Among 15,039 personnel who gambled in the past year, 2.7% reported experiencing agitation related to gambling. Additionally, about half of those affected also suffered from depression, anxiety, or, in some cases, substance abuse.

Diagnosis Criteria for Gambling Disorders

To receive a diagnosis of a gambling disorder, individuals must exhibit four or five behavioral and psychological symptoms within a 12-month period. This strict criterion ensures accurate identification but may exclude those with less severe problems who still require support.",https://www.newsnet5.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gao-report-pentagon-gambling-disorders-military-preparedness.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-29 03:56:44.602224
