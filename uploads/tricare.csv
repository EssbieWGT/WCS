Prevent Bigger Problems with Early, Conservative Care | New York Dental Clinic | Daegu Dental Clinic

Cavities may seem small, but if left untreated, they can rapidly progress—damaging deeper tooth layers, causing pain, and eventually requiring root canal therapy or even extraction. At New York Dental Clinic, a leading Daegu dental clinic, we specialize in early-stage cavity detection and minimally invasive treatment that preserves your natural tooth and protects your long-term oral health.

Whether it’s your first cavity or a recurring issue under an old filling, we use advanced diagnostic tools and aesthetic materials to restore your smile quickly, safely, and painlessly.

🦠 What Is a Cavity?

A cavity (or dental caries) is the result of tooth enamel breakdown caused by acid-producing bacteria. This acid forms when sugars and carbohydrates combine with plaque on the tooth surface. If not addressed, it can eat through the enamel, spread into the dentin, and eventually reach the nerve, causing infection, pain, and tooth loss.

✅ Signs You May Have a Cavity:

Sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweets

A visible hole or dark spot on the tooth

Pain when chewing or biting down

Bad breath or an unpleasant taste

Roughness or food getting stuck in certain areas

Even if you don’t feel pain, cavities can silently progress. That’s why regular checkups at New York Dental are critical for early detection.

🛠️ Our Cavity Treatment Options

At our Daegu dental clinic, we offer a range of filling materials to suit every need—whether it's cosmetic, functional, or budget-conscious:

1. Resin (Tooth-Colored Fillings)

Aesthetic and natural-looking

Requires minimal enamel removal

Ideal for front teeth and visible areas

2. Gold Fillings

Extremely durable—can last 20+ years

Excellent for molars and heavy chewers

Biocompatible and wear-resistant

3. Amalgam (Silver Fillings)

Long-lasting and cost-effective

Fast to apply and ideal for posterior teeth

Not suitable for patients with metal allergies or cosmetic concerns

4. Ceramic / CEREC Fillings

Made of high-strength porcelain

Custom-designed with CAD/CAM technology

Best for patients who want a seamless, stain-resistant restoration

We also provide inlays and onlays for larger cavities where standard fillings may not offer enough structural support.

💡 Why Treat Cavities Early?

✔️ Prevent Root Canal or Extraction

Catching decay early avoids nerve damage and saves your natural tooth.

✔️ Stop Spread to Adjacent Teeth

Cavities can affect neighboring teeth if bacteria aren't removed.

✔️ Restore Function and Appearance

A healthy, smooth tooth surface helps with chewing, speech, and aesthetics.

✔️ Quick and Comfortable

Small cavities can often be treated in less than 30 minutes, with little or no discomfort.

🧾 Cost of Cavity Treatment in Daegu

Cavity treatment pricing depends on location, size, and material used:

Resin Fillings: ₩100,000–₩300,000

Gold Fillings: ₩500,000–₩1,000,000 (subject to gold pricing)

Amalgam Fillings: ₩80,000–₩150,000

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, engaged with installation leaders and Defense Health Agency officials to discuss modernization initiatives and the base’s evolving role within the MHS. Leaders highlighted Travis AFB's strategic role as a readiness hub and a vital link in the Department of Defense’s integrated medical and logistics network.

While visiting David Grant USAF Medical Center, military health leaders showcased the team’s contributions to military medicine. DGMC prepares warfighters, sustains medical proficiency, and enhances medical force readiness through innovation and partnerships. Its mission includes trauma training, global aeromedical evacuation, contingency response, and integrated Veterans Affairs/DHA healthcare delivery models.

“David Grant is not just a hospital -- it’s a critical piece of the readiness and logistics infrastructure that connects the medical mission to global mobility operations,” said Col Patrick Parsons, 60th Medical Group commander and DGMC’s director. “What happens here directly supports the warfighter anywhere in the world.”

DGMC leaders emphasized the importance of joint training initiatives, which include training medics, nurses and trauma teams alongside civilian partners, recognizing this integrated approach will be essential in future conflicts, while also enhancing vital medical skills for high-quality patient care at home.

They also showcased ongoing efforts to bolster workforce resilience through clinical training, expanded readiness rotations, and robust academic affiliations. These initiatives aim to ensure the medical force remains adaptable and prepared for emerging challenges.

During a town hall at DGMC and throughout his visit, Ferrara expressed his deep appreciation for the staff's commitment, professionalism, and ongoing impact on military medicine. He also emphasized the vital role Travis AFB plays in developing a resilient and ready medical force, capable of responding globally with speed and efficiency.

“I deeply value these visits because they provide an opportunity to see firsthand the incredible work being done and the unique capabilities that drive our mission forward,” Ferrara said. “Most importantly, I want to thank our medical professionals at Travis for their unwavering dedication to caring for patients, pursuing excellence, and training the next generation of medical professionals who will carry this mission into the future.”

The visit reaffirmed the DOD’s focus on ensuring the MHS remains a cornerstone of military readiness, with Travis AFB and DGMC at the forefront for the delivery of world-class medical care and operational support.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9110749/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-18 17:56:18.717191

When someone thinks about what people use their insurance for, they often think about things like broken bones, long-term illnesses, and cardiac events. However, there are other complex conditions a person can use their Tricare insurance to get help for that they may not know about.

Substance use disorders cause physical and psychological damage to people who suffer from them. The disorders can be overcome when a person attends a licensed professional treatment program that treats people who have an addiction to alcohol or drugs. For this reason, Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California is available to those who need help finding a way to heal from their dependence on substances.

About Tricare Insurance

Tricare offers health plans, special programs, prescriptions, and dental plans, and most of their plans meet the requirements for coverage provided under the Affordable Care Act.

What Types of Rehab Programs in California Does Tricare Cover?

Tricare is in-network with Bright Future, which means several types of rehab programs can be accessed to help people in all stages of recovery enroll in the right treatment plan for their specific needs. Upon acceptance to a program, each person will receive an assessment to determine which level of care is right for them.

Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California can be used when attending the following types of programs:

Detox:This is the beginning step in treatment for people who have substance use disorders. A detox program usually takes seven to ten days.

Residential:After attending detox, a residential program provides the multi-disciplinary treatment a person needs to continue the work begun during detoxification. Residential programs typically run from 30 to 90 days.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP): PHP requires the person to travel to a facility for their treatment sessions and then return home. Appointments take place for several hours per day on weekdays.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):IOP requires attendance for several hours each week, which gives people time to commit to personal and professional obligations.

Does Tricare Cover Detox?

Tricare covers detoxification programs because they provide people with the structured and nurturing care they need as they navigate the first several days of their recovery.

Does Tricare Cover Residential Rehab?

Once a person completes detox, they can use their coverage to enroll in a residential rehab. They will live in a comfortable facility so they can have round-the-clock care that helps them manage their withdrawal symptoms.

Does Tricare Cover Outpatient Treatment?

TRICARE beneficiaries in Hamilton, Hill, Lampasas, Maverick, Sutton, and Uvalde counties are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through July 27.

For beneficiaries in Bandera, Bexar, Burnet, Caldwell, Coke, Comal, Concho, Gillespie, Guadalupe, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Reeves, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson counties, the date has been extended from July 17 to July 27.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy. As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

I’m adhering to my military branch’s instructions on keeping physically fit and eating nutritiously, but I’m having trouble getting rid of some excess pounds from my last duty station, where I mostly sat at a desk. How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way?

Sincerely,

U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon

To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you’ll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

--

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you're doing vigorous exercise where you're getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you're still moving quite a bit, and that's a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it's also important to recognize that it's fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don't achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

""Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,"" Franzos noted. ""Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.""

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It's just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We've taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzos said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they're going to reinforce that, and they're going to want you to prove to them that you've taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

For more information, check out these resources, and remember, stay safe out there. We want you and your teammates to stay fit and in fighting shape.

Or, have you just married a uniformed service member? If you’re new to TRICARE, you may have some questions about how to enroll in a plan, get care, and learn more about your coverage. So, what exactly is TRICARE?

“TRICARE is the uniformed health care program for service members, retirees, their family members, and other eligible beneficiaries,” explained Malcolm Jones, a TRICARE subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency. “It brings together the resources of military hospitals and clinics with a network of civilian health care providers and pharmacies.”

TRICARE covers:

Active duty service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

Survivors

Certain former spouses

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Dependent parents and parents-in-law (In some locations, they may be eligible for TRICARE Plus, a program offered at some military hospitals and clinics.)

Foreign force members and their family members

Are you in one of these groups? Keep reading to learn more about the basics of using your TRICARE benefit.

Eligibility

Your uniformed service personnel office determines your TRICARE eligibility.

To check your eligibility, first make sure your information is fully updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Sponsors are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must register their eligible family members by going to a local ID card office. (Note: You should call first, or set up an appointment online, to check appointment availability.)

Then, log in to milConnect to check if you’re eligible for TRICARE. Once you’ve registered on the milConnect website, you can update your contact information in DEERS and view your TRICARE enrollment information.

Health plans

Choosing a plan

You have different TRICARE health plan options depending on your sponsor’s status, your relationship to your sponsor, your age, and where you live.

To see which plans you may be eligible for, check out the Plan Finder Tool and answer a few simple questions. Then, you can use the Compare Plans Tool to figure out which plan is right for you. (Note: Families can have split enrollment, meaning some family members can enroll in one plan, while others enroll in a different one.)

Enrolling in a plan

Once you know your plan, visit TRICARE Enrollment for steps on how to enroll or purchase a plan. These steps may differ depending on the plan you choose and where you live.

Are you a new active duty family member? Once you’re registered in DEERS, you’ll be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan based on where you live and the plan selection of your other family members who aren’t active duty service members. You have 90 days from the automatic enrollment date to change to a different plan (TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime Remote, or the US Family Health Plan, if available).

Changing plans

Interested in switching your TRICARE plan? You may have the opportunity to do so during the annual TRICARE Open Season in the fall each year. Changes you make during open season will take effect Jan. 1 of the following year.

You may also be able to change your plan when you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. QLEs are certain life changes that open a 90-day window for you and your family members to make eligible enrollment changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.

Common QLEs include, but aren’t limited to:

Marriage, divorce, or annulment

Birth or adoption of a child (or placement of a child by a court in a member’s home)

Moving

Activation or deactivation

Retirement or separation

Losing or gaining other health insurance

If you experience a QLE, make sure to update DEERS right away.

Getting care

Regions

TRICARE is available worldwide, and your benefits are the same no matter where you live. But different regional contractors help deliver the benefit around the world. If you get civilian health care, this means you’ll reach out to different customer service contacts depending on where you live.

There are two TRICARE regions in the U.S.:

East Region

West Region

And there is one Overseas Region.

To learn which region you’re in, visit Regions.

Military hospitals and clinics

The DHA operates military hospitals and clinics. You may be able to seek care there, depending on where you are, what plan you have, and your beneficiary group.

Civilian network

You can also seek care from a civilian network of TRICARE-authorized providers. This network depends on your region.

To search for a network provider, use the Find a Doctor Tool to get you to the right provider directory.

Note: You may be able to see a non-network TRICARE-authorized provider, depending on your TRICARE plan. But you may have higher out-of-pocket costs, and you may have to file your own claims.

ID cards

For most beneficiaries, you’ll need to show your Uniformed Services ID card to your provider as proof of TRICARE coverage. If you’re an active duty service member, you’ll need to show your Common Access Card.

Coverage

TRICARE covers treatments, procedures, prescription drugs, or devices that are medically necessary and considered proven. Learn more about how a service becomes a TRICARE-covered benefit.

You can use the Covered Services Tool to see if a service is covered by TRICARE or not. You can search by keyword or browse common categories.

Pharmacy, dental, and vision coverage

TRICARE offers prescription drug coverage and several options for filling your prescriptions. You have the same prescription coverage with almost any TRICARE health plan. (Note: If you’re enrolled in USFHP, you have separate pharmacy coverage.)

To check if your prescription drugs are covered, use the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE’s medical coverage. Depending on your beneficiary group, you may get dental care through:

Military dental clinics

Active Duty Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program

Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage, including eye exams, depends on:

Who you are

Your TRICARE plan

Your age

Costs

Each TRICARE plan has different costs for care and coverage. See TRICARE Costs to view and compare costs for covered services, enrollment fees, and plan premiums.

Do you have more questions about plan options, enrollment, or getting care? Contact your regional contractor or visit www.tricare.mil for more information. Welcome to TRICARE!",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/getting-started-with-TRICARE.png,N,0.0,2025-07-18 11:56:29.269257
