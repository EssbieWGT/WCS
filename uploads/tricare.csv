This initiative builds on the organization’s deepening commitment throughout 2025 to assist those affected by alcohol and substance use disorders, and reflects recognition of the broader mental health challenges facing military communities.

A Commitment to Support Those Who Serve Our Country

In recent years, TriCareRehabs.com has served as a vital referral and guidance resource, connecting hundreds of veterans and service members to treatment facilities that accept TRICARE insurance and facilitating timely access to evidence-based care.

The organization’s leadership noted that many clients confronting substance use issues also experience co-occurring emotional and psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, grief, and relationship strain. To better address these needs, TriCareRehabs.com is now expanding its support to include mental health services alongside addiction treatment.

Under the new offering, TriCareRehabs.com will guide clients toward qualified providers offering therapy, counseling, dual diagnosis care, and integrated behavioral health services tailored to the military lifestyle. Treatment modalities span inpatient psychiatric care, outpatient counseling, partial hospitalization programs, intensive outpatient services, and long-term supportive therapy. Through this holistic approach, the organization seeks to reduce fragmentation in care and foster better long-term outcomes.

Placement at Top In-Network Behavioral Health Facilities Nationwide

TriCareRehabs.com emphasizes that it is not a treatment provider itself, but a navigation and referral service. Its expanded role includes helping clients understand insurance coverage, preauthorization requirements, facility matching, and transitions between levels of care.

The facilities that their expert team assists in placement for accept TRICARE plans, including TRICARE for Life plans, all of which typically cover both substance use disorder treatment and mental health services, depending on eligibility and clinical justification. The service also seeks to ensure clients are directed to providers in the network, to minimize out-of-pocket costs.

By integrating mental health into its service portfolio, TriCareRehabs.com aims to enhance the depth and reach of support available to the military population and their families. The organization believes that addressing psychological health and substance-related issues together creates a more resilient pathway to recovery and stability.

The company stated the security incident occurred in December, but it was not discovered until late June. Notification letters were subsequently sent to affected individuals in mid-August. A wide range of personal and medical data was exposed, including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and patient identification numbers. The compromised information also encompassed health insurance details, comprehensive medical histories, specific diagnoses, and treatment plans. This breach impacted thousands of residents in Texas as part of the total number of affected individuals.

In its notification letter, the company informed patients, “As a result of a cybersecurity incident, CPAP learned that an unauthorized actor gained access to our network environment.” The firm confirmed it is now working with external cybersecurity professionals to investigate the incident and to determine the full extent to which personal or sensitive data had been compromised.

Department of the Army civilians who support initial military training are ‘excepted’ employees and will continue to work during a government shutdown.
“Please call 833286-3732 to schedule or cancel appointments.” For questions about TRICARE during the shutdown, visit www.tricare.mil/shutdown.
• Compensation: The Military Leaders Economic Security Toolkit, located on the Military OneSource website, offers information and support.
• Finance and military personnel flight services continued, although wait times may have increased.","During the federal government shutdown, civilian employees at Oklahoma’s military installations were furloughed and not allowed to work, not even to respond to emails or telephone calls.

However, officials said routine military duties and operations continued uninterrupted.

Fort Sill Army post “Due to a lapse in federal appropriations, civilian employees of the Fires Center of Excellence and Fort Sill are currently furloughed and are not permitted to work, including responding to emails or phone calls. Normal operations will resume once funding is restored,” announced Bryan L. Araujo of Fort Sill’s Public Affairs Office.

“All ongoing projects will be suspended until government operations are reinstated,” he added.

In response to an inquiry from Southwest Ledger, Edward Muñiz, Public Affairs Director for the Fires Center of Excellence and Fort Sill, reported the following: “All service members continue to report to their place of duty and work during a government shutdown. Department of the Army civilians who support initial military training are ‘excepted’ employees and will continue to work during a government shutdown.

“Trainees will continue their Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training with no interruption.

“All Defense Commissary Agency and AAFES (shoppette) facilities are operating normally. And all dining facilities are operating normally.”

Reynolds Army Health Clinic remains open and continues to schedule appointments.

“We will do our best to minimize the impact on our beneficiaries who need health care during the shutdown,” RAHC posted in a message. “Your health and well-being remain our highest priority.”

No medical or dental appointments or procedures have been canceled. All ancillary services (pharmacy, laboratory, radiology) remain operational. “Please call 833286-3732 to schedule or cancel appointments.”

For questions about TRICARE during the shutdown, visit www.tricare.mil/shutdown.

Altus AFB At the very top of the Altus Air Force Base page was this declaration: “Due to the government shutdown, this website is not being updated.”

The only information posted on the Altus AFB website was issued by the Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs on Sept. 30. It reported: Assistance to reduce the impact of the government shutdown on Airmen, Guardians, civilians and their families is available through various means. Those experiencing financial difficulties should contact their chain of command, who can provide more information on the financial aid organizations below.

• Compensation: The Military Leaders Economic Security Toolkit, located on the Military OneSource website, offers information and support. The site is updated regularly to reflect challenges and policy changes related to economic security.

• Unemployment Benefits: Furloughed employees are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits, but excepted employees working on a full-time basis are generally not eligible. Employees who wish to file should do so with the Unemployment Office for the state where the employee worked (i.e., last official duty station prior to furlough).

Please be advised that when employees receive retroactive pay they will be required to pay back any unemployment benefits received in accordance with State law. For more information, see OPM guidance and the U.S. Department of Labor’s Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees.

• Personal Financial Readiness: The Military and Family Readiness Center personal financial readiness program sustains and improves financial literacy and readiness by offering information, education, training and free personal financial counseling to Airmen, Guardians and their families. The DAF has also increased the number of Personal Financial Managers available to assist and enhance financial readiness and money management skills for members and their families.

The Air Force Aid Society continues to support emergent needs such as basic living expenses (e.g., food, rent/mortgage, utilities), vehicle expenses (e.g., payments, repairs, insurance) and childcare costs. Airmen and Guardians can submit requests through local Military and Family Readiness Centers and Airman and Family Readiness Centers.

If Airmen, Guardians or their families are not near an aid organization, they may seek financial assistance from the Red Cross.

Several banking institutions, such as USAA, Navy Federal Credit Union and Marine Federal Credit Union, have been known to advance military pay to their customers during government shutdowns. Contact your bank to inquire about their policies for situations like these.

• Food Insecurity: First sergeants and Military and Family Readiness Centers assist Airmen, Guardians and their families in need of food security-related grants and loans with referrals to programs such as U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Federal Subsistence Supplemental Allowance program and the Air Force Aid Society.

The FY22 National Defense Authorization Act established a Basic Needs Allowance. The BNA Program provides supplemental income for military members and dependents whose gross household income falls below 200% of federal poverty guidelines.

TRICARE: In response to the ongoing possibility of a government shutdown, the Defense Health Agency has authorized its TRICARE contractors to continue delivering health care to the 9.4 million beneficiaries of TRICARE. TRICARE beneficiaries seeking medical care from private providers should feel no significant effects. Care at military hospitals and clinics would remain largely unaffected. The TRICARE website includes current information about the impact of the shutdown on TRICARE health plans and military hospitals and clinics.

Vance AFB The only information posted on the website of Vance Air Force Base at Enid was this statement: “DUE TO THE LAPSE IN APPROPRIATIONS, THIS PAGE WILL NOT BE UPDATED REGULARLY UNTIL FULL OPERATIONS RESUME.” McAlester Army Ammunition Plant Southwest Ledger placed calls to two telephone numbers listed on the installation’s website; no one answered either call. Also, no information whatsoever was listed on the website about the government shutdown and how it affected the ammunition plant. Tinker AFB The most comprehensive notice of what was and what wasn’t available during the shutdown was posted on the Tinker Air Force Base website.

At Tinker, in the Oklahoma City metro area, Public Affairs for the 72nd Air Base Wing announced that the base “remains committed to sustaining national defense, supporting mission-essential operations, and ensuring the safety and readiness of its service members, civilian workforce, and families.”

Myriad services were not affected by the shutdown.

• Flying operations, depot maintenance, and national defense tasks continued uninterrupted.

• Aircraft launch, recovery, and air traffic control remained active.

Agency/Office: Defense Health Agency

Location: TRICARE Dental Program Office - Aurora (Colorado)

Title: DEFENSE HEALTH AGENCY DENTAL PROGRAM OFFICE SERVICES

DESCRIPTION: The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is developing the 7th generation of the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP) contracts, as well as a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) contract to provide services to the TDP-7 contract. The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2023, Section 701, requires the Department to offer a multi-carrier, multi-choice dental benefits program for Active-Duty family members, survivors, and qualified Reserve Component members and their families. The current contract, TDP-6, consists of one contract/contractor providing all required dental services and necessary eligibility, enrollment, and other administrative functions. The TDP-7 contract will remove several responsibilities performed under the TDP-6 contract and transfer them to the TPA contract. The TPA contractor will manage the administrative features of the premium sharing plans in TDP-7 including eligibility, enrollment, plan changes, premium payment processes, reconciliation, submission of qualifying life events, and address changes for eligible TRICARE beneficiaries. Dental insurance contractors will continue to: process claims; build and maintain dental provider networks; educate providers on TDP policies, educate beneficiaries and eligibles on TDP coverage; and provide customer service to TDP beneficiaries.

The Industry Forum will be held 4-5 November 2025, 8:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. MST, at the DHA Aurora Office. Please see link below with separate RSVP Instructions for those who wish to attend.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Codes are 524114 for TDP and 524292 for TPA. The Product Serivce Codes (PSCs) are Q503 Medical-Dentistry for TDP and Q201 Medical-Managed Care for TPA.

The intent of the Industry Forum is to accomplish the following:

To gather information from the dental care industry through an open exchange of information to be used by the DHA TRICARE Health Plan Dental Program Office and Program Management Office in support of continuous market research in the development of the TDP-7 and TPA acquisition strategy. DHA desires to identify, to the maximum extent possible, commercial best practices in delivering the TRICARE dental benefit and TPA services.

The Government intends to hold a general forum on 4 November 2025 and intends to meet individually with interested TDP7 or TPA PRIME CONTRACTORS on 4 and 5 November 2025. Each interested prime contractor may bring up to three in person attendees. A virtual option will be available for any additional attendees. Industry is advised that not all members of the Government team may be available for every individual session. Information presented by attendees will be shared within the Government team. Industry should bring at least five copies of any briefings provided.

DISCUSSION: The current TDP contract (TDP-6) will expire on 28 February 2030. The NDAA for FY 2023 requires the DHA to develop and implement improvements to dental contracts requiring DoD to offer a multi-carrier, multichoice dental benefits program for Active-Duty families and qualified Reserve Component members and their families.

CONTRACT PURPOSE: DHA is contemplating awarding TDP-7 contracts to multiple carriers, as well as a TPA contract, utilizing full and open competition to provide the covered benefit, and manage enrollment and eligibility and process encounter data.

TDP-7 CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: The following are anticipated to be the major areas of required services for the TDP-7 contract:

Standardized pricing structures that support affordability, simplify comparisons, and reduce enrollment barriers.

Information exchange with the TPA using a systems architecture flexible enough to support technical, business, and mandatory Federal requirements without inhibiting or limiting functionality or user experience.

Dental insurance claims processing in accordance with contractual obligations and TRICARE Dental Program policies.

Maintain a global dental provider network to meet the needs of TDP beneficiaries, including OCONUS providers.

Education of network providers on claims processing procedures and their own contractual obligations.

Education of TRICARE beneficiaries regarding services, how to enroll through the TPA, and what coverage is available under each plan offered.

Comprehensive range of marketing materials, including brochures, flyers, and digital content effectively communicating program offerings and tailored to the military community.

Maintain a Customer Service/Call Center with a knowledgeable, courteous, and responsive call center staff resulting in highly satisfied beneficiaries.

Execute a methodical and carefully planned transition plan, with a focus on maintaining continuity of care and access to services.

Testing capabilities complying with Government Performance Readiness Validation and Performance Readiness Assessment and Verification requirements during the 12-month transition period.

TPA CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: The following performance-based objectives are to be accomplished in the TPA contract:

Provide a cost effective, centralized TDP benefit eligibility and enrollment system.

Provide customer service support for TDP, including plan changes, submission of qualifying life events, and address changes.

Provide related premium/allotment administration services.

Provide a mechanism to reconcile enrollments, premiums, and allotments completely and accurately at the individual enrollee level with each TDP carrier.

Provide superior customer service/call center services for the convenience of users.

Provide a user friendly and informative website with account information and decision support tools with TDP plans' dental premiums and benefits comparison.

Provide education and outreach to eligible beneficiaries.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): DHA sent out RFIs for both TPA and TDP-7 and this forum will be used to discuss questions in those RFIs, as well as other topics. If industry has questions not in those RFIs, DHA asks they be submitted prior to the forum so the appropriate points of contact are present to answer the questions. It is envisioned participants in the Forum, after discussion with DHA, will submit post-Forum position papers, concepts, and alternative ideas related to Forum topics. All Industry Forum attendees having post-Forum questions or submitting position/concept papers will be given an opportunity to further discuss any questions or submissions with the Government after the Forum.

Comments, questions, position/concept papers, and capabilities should be provided to the Government at the address below. Questions industry would like the DHA to address at the industry forum may be sent to the address below, however, due to time constraints, the Government may be unable to provide individual answers during the open forum.

RESPONSES: Written responses are not required; however, written questions will be accepted up to ten (10) business days prior to the Industry Forum. Any questions submitted, unless of a proprietary nature, may be addressed during the Industry Forum. Questions should be submitted to Kristin Moore, Kristin.m.moore13.civ@health.mil and Chelsea Lavelle, Chelsea.m.lavelle.civ@health.mil.

I understand that if I get rated 30% or more of DoD or DoW whatever it is now, I will get the Tricare for Life/Prime.
I really like Tricare Reserve Select so I assume Tricare for Life is similar.
Will they open up my VA claims again and I have to go through that hassle, or they will omit VA since I'm already VA rated and they will just do the DoD rating?","Hello,

Here is my situation.

20+ years in the Guard with several deployments. I'm already rated at VA 100% P&T. I currently use Tricare Reserve Select for myself and my family. I already have my 20 good years letter. Can experts please tell me what happens if I select to be medboarded out? I understand that if I get rated 30% or more of DoD or DoW whatever it is now, I will get the Tricare for Life/Prime.

Is this Tricare only for my or my spouse/family too? If not, can I pay a difference to get them on this plan? I really like Tricare Reserve Select so I assume Tricare for Life is similar.

If I'm on Tricare for Life after retirement, can I put my family on CHAMPVA?

When I go to the annual PHA (physical health assessment), and I tell them about my conditions they will have no choice but to flag me. That will probably result in medboard actions.

What happens next? Will they open up my VA claims again and I have to go through that hassle, or they will omit VA since I'm already VA rated and they will just do the DoD rating?

What happens if for some reason they rate me lower than 30%?

I already did some research and have a good general understanding of how this process works, but please share it with me anyways so I don't miss anything. Thank you for your responses.",,N,0.0,2025-10-06 19:56:31.523212

Recognition: From Invisible to Indispensable Military spouses were once the “silent ranks,” expected to endure without acknowledgment.

A paycheck might show up late, communication came in thin, blue aerogram envelopes, and recognition rarely extended beyond polite nods at a change of command ceremony.

These challenges have not disappeared, but the way military families meet them has changed. Today’s spouses carry the same grit, determination, and resilience, but they do so with advantages their predecessors could only dream of. Here are seven ways military life for spouses has improved across the generations.

1. Pay and Benefits: From Paper Checks to Predictable Deposits

Older generations of spouses knew the stress of wondering if payday would bring an envelope of cash or another round of IOUs to the landlord (the “poor house” was an actual thing). Today, direct deposit lands on schedule, predictable and steady, while housing allowances and cost-of-living adjustments stretch further than ration books ever could.

While no one pretends military pay will allow you and your friends to vacay in Tahoe, spouses can at least plan a grocery run without hoping the commissary will extend credit until payday.

2. Healthcare Access: To TRICARE and Beyond

There was a time when medical care meant whatever the base clinic could provide and little more. A sick child might have to wait days for a doctor, and specialized care could be out of reach entirely. Now, TRICARE opens doors to networks of providers, expanded mental health care, and even telehealth appointments from the comfort of your living room couch.

It isn’t flawless by any means, as milspouses still experience the frustration of long hold times and billing surprises, but the safety net is stronger and options are wider than what previous generations had to contend with.

3. Communication: From Waiting Weeks to Real-Time Connection

A letter from Vietnam or Korea could take weeks to arrive, often outdated by the time it was read. Families clung to every word like lifelines. Today, military spouses can video call from their bathroom while a deployed partner is halfway around the world. Kids can show off missing teeth over FaceTime, anniversaries can be celebrated with an emoji exchange, and social media groups keep spouses connected across continents.

Distance still has a sting, but anxiously waiting agonizing weeks is no longer the default.

4. Career and Education Opportunities: From Limited Options to Portable Paths

For decades, moving every few years meant starting over again. Careers would dissolve with each relocation, and educational dreams were often shelved.

Today, programs like MyCAA help spouses cover the cost of training, and online universities make degrees more portable. Remote work and interstate licensing agreements mean that more spouses can maintain professional identities, rather than being defined solely by their partner’s service. Progress is uneven, but the doors are more open than they have ever been.

5. Community Support: From Isolation to Infrastructure

Ask anyone who has served, and they will tell you that military life can feel lonely, even in crowded base housing. Support came only if you happened to live next to the right neighbor. Today, there are organized Family Readiness Groups, school liaisons, chaplains, and countless online networks that turn strangers into mentors overnight. A spouse searching for a pediatrician, a babysitter, or just a decent bagel can now find it with a few messages.

Isolation hasn’t magically evaporated, but the pathways out of it are clearer and stronger.

6. Recognition: From Invisible to Indispensable

Military spouses were once the “silent ranks,” expected to endure without acknowledgment. This was often accomplished with aplomb. That silence is slowly being broken. Annual appreciation days, awards that highlight their contributions, and advocacy groups that push for better policies have given spouses more visibility.

They may not yet receive the credit equal to the sacrifices they make (what else is new), but the cultural tide is shifting. What was once hidden labor is now being recognized as essential to readiness and morale, not to mention the mission.

7. Quality of Life: From Bare Bones to Built for Families

Military housing once meant drafty walls, unreliable plumbing, and waiting lists for repairs that stretched further than Black Friday lines. Today’s standards are higher, with accountability measures and renovations aimed at making homes safer and healthier. Expanded child care options, commissary delivery services, and inclusive programs for families enrolled in EFMP have also improved daily military life.

It isn’t perfect; every milspouse has a story of broken appliances or soul-crushing waitlists, but the baseline of comfort has climbed significantly.

We Salute You

The essence of a spouse’s military life has never been about ease for themselves; it has always been about their families first. It has always been about courage, adaptation, and finding strength wherever possible. Today’s spouses still carry that weight of uncertainty, but they do so with steadier paychecks, better healthcare, and stronger networks at their backs.
