It’s unclear how many jobs San Antonio will lose in the move — early indications were about 200.

The Army is in the midst of a service branch restructure aimed at reducing inefficiencies, and San Antonio’s congressional delegation put everything it had into promoting the city for the new consolidated command.

Nevertheless, Breaking Defense reported this week that the Army’s Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said it will be stood up in North Carolina before the end of the year — surprising members of Congress who still haven’t been given the full details of the move.

“On the surface, it may not seem as if [the administration] listened,” said U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-San Antonio), who tried to stop the move by putting San Antonio-specific language in a defense reauthorization bill that the Senate still hasn’t taken up.

“But there are bigger conversations that are being had as far as the overall direction of the Department of War,” he continued. “If we’re consolidating in one area, but we’re growing in another, I think that ultimately doesn’t hurt our city.”

Local leaders have long had their sights set on courting military medicine installations, which they believe would align closely with the region’s growing bioscience industry.

As talk of losing the Army North and Army South commands heated up, the City of San Antonio and Bexar County have been hurrying along plans to renovate an old Fort Sam hospital building that’s expected to house about 600 Defense Health Agency (DHA) employees when it’s complete.

“While I am disappointed to hear the consolidated headquarters will relocate to North Carolina, … San Antonio is unmatched in our ability to host military missions and families, and we look forward to working with the [administration] to identify additional missions [the city] may be able to host,” Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones said Thursday.

A DHA move?

It’s no secret San Antonio is hoping the Defense Health Agency, which is currently headquartered in Falls Church, Va., could be that next get.

It has about 130,000 employees spread out across the country, and Gonzales said Texas lawmakers are now well-positioned to push for the agency to call San Antonio home.

“I’m working with Sen. [John] Cornyn on growing out the Defense Health Agency, [which already has some jobs] located here, and I think [San Antonio] would be a great location for the headquarters.”

Last week Jones also pointed to the city’s many offerings on the health-science front as a path forward, including UTSA’s merger with the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.

The city and county each set aside $10 million from their tight budgets to help renovate the Fort Sam Houston building for DHA, and last week applied for state money to help.

“This one grant that we’re applying for is important in the larger conversation about how we think about the strengthening the defense ecosystem, building the pipeline of talent recruiting companies here, and also strengthening the very the ties that are so unique to [our region],” Jones said.",https://sanantonioreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bria-Woods-Joint-base-san-antonio-JBSA-fort-sam-houston-Randolph-features-6JAN2025-6-scaled-1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-16 19:01:07.918724

More than half a million Tennesseans pay lower health insurance premiums because they receive federal health care subsidies.
Currently, with subsidies, Roberts pays $10 a month for her insurance premium.
Subsidy amounts vary from person to person based on income level, household size, age and health care plan.
Even for people who are not directly affected by the subsidy expiration, health care experts say there will be wider impacts on Tennessee's health care ecosystem.","Chattanooga resident Cheri Roberts, 62, said on Wednesday that if the shutdown of the federal government continues, she worries her very health could hang in the balance.

""I see eight specialists and am looking at upcoming surgeries. I couldn't afford (health insurance) premiums without (federal subsidies),"" she said by phone. ""You know, I'm not trying to exaggerate, but I might die if I stop going to the doctor.""

More than half a million Tennesseans pay lower health insurance premiums because they receive federal health care subsidies. Those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year.

Currently, with subsidies, Roberts pays $10 a month for her insurance premium. Without subsidies, she said her premium will cost $1,140 a month — which she cannot possibly afford.

""I just had no idea,"" Roberts said about the expiring tax credits.

It wasn't until her daughter, Jessica Roberts, told her about the pending expiration of the subsidies that she learned her health insurance could be in jeopardy, she said.

Democrats have leveraged the ongoing federal government shutdown in an attempt to permanently extend federal health care subsidies like those Roberts uses, rather than let the program expire.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said that without a permanent extension of subsidies, Senate Democrats will not vote to pass a temporary budget to reopen the government. More than two weeks into the shutdown, an agreement with Republicans on a permanent extension has not been reached.

U.S. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said the proposal for a permanent extension is costly.

""What we asked them to do is to continue the government under the budget that they all voted for under President (Joe) Biden,"" Hagerty previously said by phone. ""They've refused to do it. They proposed another trillion dollars of expenditures.""

'STICKER SHOCK'

Roberts requires periodic knee injections to walk and is trying to schedule a knee replacement. She also cares for her father, who is in his 90s.

""Knowing that this is on the line, I mean, it's just hard for me to look into the next year and see any kind of quality of life, because I could not get my issues treated,"" Roberts said. ""I don't want to sound like I'm over-exaggerating or dramatizing, but it will completely affect my life, my way of life, how I take care of my dad.""

Jessica Roberts said her mom will have to move in with her in Virginia to save money for medical costs if her subsidies expire.

About 200,000 Tennesseans could lose their health insurance if they lose their subsidies, according to KFF, an independent health policy research non-profit.

""A lot of people, I don't think they're watching and looking at what's going on, so they don't know this is coming,"" said Silvia Calzadilla, who works as the statewide director of Enrollment Services for Tennessee Health Care Campaign, where she helps Tennesseans purchase subsidy-qualified health care plans. ""We have close to 400 clients. I haven't had any calls, no people asking me anything, which is weird.""

For a 60-year-old couple making $82,000 in the congressional district represented by U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Ooltewah, which includes Hamilton and Bradley counties, along with eight others, premiums will increase 261%, from $581 a month to $2,099, according to KFF.

""If they don't have subsidies, I don't think many people are going to be able to afford the insurance, because it's really expensive,"" said Calzadilla by phone. ""I have people say to me, if you don't help me, I'm going to die, because the hospital said they are not going to treat me anymore if I don't have insurance.""

Subsidy amounts vary from person to person based on income level, household size, age and health care plan.

""It's not a flat $100 off for everybody, and I think that also makes it very complicated for people to understand it in a real way,"" said Mandy Spears, executive vice president of the Sycamore Institute, an independent, nonpartisan public policy research center for Tennessee. ""I think that's probably going to be a very real ... sticker shock situation when people go to renew.""

'SERIOUS CONCERN'

BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee provides subsidy-qualifying health insurance plans and began to raise awareness about the potential expiration months ago through outreach on social media and an opinion article.

""This is a serious concern for families across the state, and that's why we've taken proactive steps to raise awareness,"" said Dalya Qualls White, senior vice president and chief communications officer of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, in an email to the Chattanooga Times Free Press. ""Since early summer, we've worked to inform our members, community leaders and elected officials about the potential impact of the expiration.""

More people in Tennessee have health insurance since the marketplace premium subsidies became available, according to a Health and Human Services report. Since the implementation of premium subsidies, the total uninsured rate in Tennessee decreased 4.6 percentage points, from 13.9% in 2013 to 9.3% in 2022.

Even for people who are not directly affected by the subsidy expiration, health care experts say there will be wider impacts on Tennessee's health care ecosystem.

A greater burden could be placed on hospitals and drive up uncompensated care costs if more Tennesseans become uninsured with the loss of subsidies.

""It's going to drive up costs and burden on the hospital systems,"" said Lacey Lyons, communications coordinator at the Tennessee Health Care Campaign. ""Because people might postpone care, and it's more costly to care for someone who has been putting off care and comes to the emergency room and is in critical condition.""

People end up using hospitals and emergency rooms as doctors, Calzadilla said. People can't pay those bills, and then those hospitals close.

""It's a chain; if you don't do one thing, another thing will happen,"" Calzadilla said.

Hospitals are required to provide certain services regardless of insurance and absorb the cost.

HOSPITAL CLOSURES

Tennessee has experienced the second-most hospital closures of any state, particularly in rural areas, with 15 closures since 2010, according to KFF.

In Tennessee, the demand for uncompensated care could increase by 29.2% or $378 million if subsidies expired, according to a study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute.

Two local clinics that provide health care to people without insurance in Chattanooga, Volunteers in Medicine Chattanooga and Purpose Point, expect more patients if premium subsidies expire.

Therma Beaman works as a community health specialist at Purpose Point in Chattanooga, said they are looking to bring on another practitioner in preparation for health care subsidies expiring.

""We are not going to turn anyone away because of the ZIP code that they live in. We're not going to turn them away because of their financial situation,"" Beaman said by phone. ""We're not going to turn them away.""

U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn characterized a permanent subsidy extension as unnecessary.

""Senate Democrats deliberately forced a shutdown and blocked a clean extension of current spending levels in favor of a nearly $1.5 trillion package of far-left priorities,"" Blackburn said in a statement.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/10/17/103811871_101625-Subsidies-Tennessee-002_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,0.0,2025-10-16 19:01:16.712621

ARLINGTON, Virginia — Connecticut-based Motive Labs and the University of Nebraska at Omaha are working on an exoskeleton for combat boots that could prevent ankle injuries during military training and in the field.

The FlyBand ExoBoot is a durable, eight-inch-tall reinforced boot built to support chronic ankle instability, aid in recovery from lingering injuries and prevent future sprains. It uses “cartridges that can be inserted on the inside of the liner of the boot,” said Sara Myers, a biomechanics professor and the principal investigator of the university’s ongoing study of the ExoBoot’s mechanics and potential use by servicemembers.

Without the carbon-fiber cartridges, the boot provides the support of a compression sleeve — with them, its support mimics a “high-motion control, air cast-looking brace,” Myers said in an interview. “That helps it evolve as people start to recover from an ankle sprain — instead of having to issue them a different device, you can just exchange the cartridge.”

On obstacle courses and jump landings on inclined surfaces, healthy individuals in the ExoBoot had “similar or better control of the medial-lateral motion, which is the way that people sprain their ankle if they have excessive motion,” while simultaneously allowing for “more natural motion in the forward plane that we walk in,” she said.

The current study — funded by the Defense Department’s Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs — is examining the boot’s effect on active and recently retired servicemembers with chronic ankle instability. Previous research has been funded by the Defense Health Agency and the Small Business Innovation Research program.

“What we’re trying to do is protect the ankle from excessive side-to-side motion — that could be either preventative, as well as used long-term by soldiers who have previous ankle sprains,” Myers said.

The exoskeleton’s invisible integration into a combat boot “may seem trivial” but is a conscious design choice, she added. Often, soldiers will avoid “ankle braces that can be seen” or having “their colleagues see them putting on a brace and then putting on the boot.”

With the ExoBoot, “it’s just the boot. It doesn’t look any different. And so, no one could tell if you had a high level or a low level of support, or any support at all,” Myers said. “That’s something that we think could help with compliance to ankle rehabilitation devices.”",,N,0.0,2025-10-16 16:00:42.332879

""Although these charges did not result from criminal actions during his time as a bus driver or involve a student on his bus route, our agency cannot rule out the possibility that Buono may have other victims,"" the Walton County Sheriff's Office says. ""We encourage anyone who believes they are a victim to please contact our agency.""

According to the sheriff's office, on Tuesday, deputies were contacted by a professor at a local college who reported that one of their students had disclosed being sexually abused.

""Investigators met with the victim, who provided a detailed statement with recordings supporting her account,"" the sheriff's office says in a release. ""The evidence depicted inappropriate sexual contact and explicit comments made by the suspect toward the victim.""

Deputies met with Buono at his home, where he initially denied the allegations.

""When presented with one of the videos, he admitted to being the individual depicted and confirmed the nature of the acts described by investigators,"" the sheriff's office says.

Buono was arrested without incident and transported to Walton County Jail.

“What happened here is nothing short of evil,” said Sheriff Michael Adkinson. “Crimes like this shake our sense of humanity, and we will not rest until justice is served.”

The investigation remains ongoing. Additional charges may be forthcoming.",https://weartv.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/19a996b4-9997-4898-aef2-036611cddd35-cover20251016T105557.512.png,N,0.0,2025-10-16 14:00:14.426626

— Chris Lovell, CEO of Lovell Government Services.

PENSACOLA, FL, UNITED STATES, October 16, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and VISIUM, the innovator behind the nation’s most advanced continuous Far-UVC sanitization systems, announced today a strategic partnership to expand access to Far-UVC technology across federal healthcare systems, including the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Under this partnership, Lovell Government Services will act as Visium’s Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor, streamlining procurement through established federal contracting channels.

Visium Far-UVC is a ceiling-mounted, UL-8802–certified system that continuously inactivates pathogens in the air and on surfaces in occupied spaces. Already deployed in healthcare, education, manufacturing, and defense environments, Visium provides a new layer of environmental protection for both workforces and workspaces. For VA and DoD facilities, the system represents a breakthrough in biosecurity, strengthening operational resilience while helping create safer, more sustainable environments. Beyond healthcare, Visium also addresses the growing need to safeguard the nation’s critical infrastructure with sustainable, always-on pathogen inactivation.

A peer-reviewed study funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and published in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology (ICHE) in September 2025 evaluated Visium ceiling-mounted Far-UVC systems in a simulated operating room. The study demonstrated significant reductions of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contamination on surfaces, providing independent evidence that Visium technology can meaningfully reduce environmental contamination and supplement existing infection prevention modalities in high-acuity healthcare environments. This latest VA-led study builds on a growing body of peer-reviewed research supporting the efficacy and safety of Far-UVC technology and has led to Far-UVC being recognized as an approved technology for use within VA healthcare facilities.

As Visium’s SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this Far-UVC technology to federal healthcare providers. The product is now available through the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency’s Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). By listing products on these contract vehicles, Lovell simplifies the acquisition process and supports government agencies in achieving their SDVOSB procurement goals.

“We are thrilled to partner with VISIUM. This partnership allows us to provide VA and DoD facilities with a VA-approved, cutting-edge technology that strengthens biosecurity, enhances facility environments, and ultimately supports the mission of caring for our nation’s veterans and service members,” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

“At VISIUM, we believe Infection Prevention infrastructure is essential to supporting the people who serve and the facilities they rely on,” said John Rajchert, Co-Founder and CEO of VISIUM. “This partnership ensures that VA, DoD, and other federal healthcare systems have access to technology that enhances biosecurity, supports operational continuity, and helps protect our nation’s critical infrastructure.”

,,2025-10-16 02:52:32+00:00,BioMed Central,Treatment variability for shoulder pain between physician and non-physician clinicians ...,"Daniel I, Maggie E, Hui-Jie, Morton-Oswald, Steven Z",,,,,https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-025-13175-w,"This cohort study used routinely collected health information to identify healthcare patterns from the initial shoulder care visit prospectively for a 3-month period.
Patients with a non-specific shoulder diagnosis and a specific diagnosis were put into the corresponding specific diagnosis category.
However, the specific shoulder disorder and the initial care setting influenced the variability and differences were not equivocal.
For rotator cuff, hypermobility, and hypomobility shoulder disorders, initially seeing a physician was more likely to result in an opioid prescription.
Furthermore, it is not clear if a specific diagnosis will necessarily substantively change the treatment.","This cohort study used routinely collected health information to identify healthcare patterns from the initial shoulder care visit prospectively for a 3-month period. The study received ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board at Brooke Army Medical Center. It was deemed exempt due to use of de-identified data and therefore the consent requirement was waived. The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Data (RECORD) [21] extension of the Strengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist was used to guide reporting.

Setting and participants

Participants were adults 18 to 65 years of age (17 years if emancipated minors on active duty), seeking care for shoulder pain between July 2013 and March 2019. All patients were beneficiaries of the Military Health System (MHS), one of the largest health systems in the United States (45 hospitals and 566 ambulatory clinics supporting nearly 10 million beneficiaries) [22]. Participants were eligible if they had at least one visit for a shoulder-related disorder in an outpatient military treatment facility and seen by a credentialed clinician. Their initial visit was termed the index date. Six months of eligibility prior to the index date and three months of eligibility after the index date were also required. Only individuals with no shoulder care in the prior six months were included. To improve the homogeneity of the sample, we excluded individuals with shoulder fractures, trauma, or open dislocations, as well as anyone with an upper extremity amputation. We excluded patients who did not have their index visits in a military clinic because claims data for the private sector do not reliably capture associated provider type and clinic setting. Patients with missing index provider type or clinic setting, or those who were only seen by non-clinicians (e.g. nurses or technicians), or visited multiple settings on the index date (e.g. primary care and emergency care) were further excluded from the analysis.

Data source

Data were sourced from the MHS Data Repository (MDR), which houses person-level electronic medical record (EMR) data and claims data for all outpatient encounters in both military and private section civilian clinics where beneficiaries seek care. There are over 250 unique data sources that feed into the MDR and missing data are continuously cross-referenced across multiple data sources for validation.

Variables

Shoulder care

We identified patients based on encounters coded with a shoulder-related International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) code 9th and 10th edition. We categorized all shoulder care within 3 months of the index date based on ICD codes subgrouped by rotator cuff (RC) related pain syndromes, acromioclavicular (AC) joint pain and dysfunction, glenohumeral instability (to include closed dislocations and subluxations), glenohumeral hypomobility (to include adhesive capsulitis), glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and non-specific shoulder pain. Patients with a non-specific shoulder diagnosis and a specific diagnosis were put into the corresponding specific diagnosis category. Finally, we placed individuals with multiple specific diagnoses into a caterogry of more than one shoulder diagnosis. We characterized shoulder-related care using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes linked to shoulder-related encounters. For all follow-up care we included encounters from both military and private sector clinics. We also included radiology and prescription data using American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) therapeutic class codes, all sourced from the MDR. The list of codes can be found in the appendix (Tables SA.8-SA.13).

Clinician type and setting

No current standard exists for classifying clinicians types, with multiple approaches used in different scenarios. Some classification systems use unique proprietary markers [23], while others use health provider taxonomy codes [24, 25]. However, the assigned classification does not guarantee the provider works in the corresponding clinical care setting [26], which is why we chose to focus more on clinic types, where actual care took place. The majority of clinical care pathways for managing musculoskeletal pain endorse a stepped care approach, where care should initiate in primary care and only escalate to specialty providers if symptoms persist or are unresponsive to initial lines of care. We categorized clinicians delivering the index visit shoulder-related care using the SKILL variable from MDR (1 = physician; 2 = non-physician). Patients seeing both physicians and non-physicians on the index date were classified as seen by physicians. We excluded cases where a patient did not see a clinician on the index visit (SKILL ≠ 1 or 2). We used product line (PRODLINE) and Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS) codes to identify the settings where initial care took place, as either primary care, emergency care, or specialty care (i.e., orthopaedics, physical medicine, physical therapy). We excluded cases where a patient visited multiple locations on the index date.

Outcome variables

We assessed healthcare utilization that occurred within the first three months after the index shoulder visit, broadly classified into three main groups: pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological treatments, and imaging. The number of prescriptions and treatments per patient. and a binary indicator of specific treatment receipt were calculated. Pharmacological treatments included NSAIDS, opioids, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers, analgesics, and steroid joint injections. Non-pharmacological treatments included physical therapy (anyone seen by a physical therapist), and other specific interventions regardless of who delivered them: exercise therapy, passive modalities (e.g., electrical stimulation, hot/cold therapy), manual therapy, and acupuncture. Imaging studies included radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), arthrograms, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Imaging was also further categorized as plain radiographs or advanced imaging, the latter of which was the combination of MRIs, arthrograms, or CT scans. We also determined the timing of imaging and classified patients as having received advanced imaging only, radiographs only, or a combination of the two (and in which order). It’s important to note that all clinicians working in this health system have priveleges for ordering radiographs and advanced imaging (e.g., occupational and physical therapists).

Statistical analysis

Diagnostic subgroups were designated based on clinician and setting seen for their initial shoulder encounter. We summarized healthcare utilization for each shoulder disorder subgroup and compared utilization events across type of clinician and settings (primary care, emergency care, or specialty care). Descriptive statistics, including mean and standard deviations, summarized the number of times the care was received per patient. Given the large sample size of this study, a small non-clinically important difference can be claimed as statistically significant with a p-value < 0.05 [27]. Therefore, we prioritized the focus on clinical relevance and did not perform inferential statistical testing.

There were 246,041 individuals meeting inclusion criteria (Table 1), with a mean (SD) age of 37.9 (12.3) years, 21.9% female, 63.1% on active duty, and 76.3% enlisted (or with enlisted sponsor; Table 2). A non-specific shoulder disorder diagnosis was the most common (73.9% of all cases). These individuals never received a more specific diagnosis. Rotator cuff related pain disorders (15.9%), glenohumeral osteoarthritis (2.0%), and hypomobility disorders (1.8%) were the next most common. Patients with more than one diagnosis accounted for 3.7% of the cohort. Patients with a non-specific diagnosis had the fewest mean [SD] visits per patient (2.8 [3.3]) and patients with multiple diagnoses and hypomobility disorders had the highest (8.3[5.7] and 6.8[5.8], respectively). Full demographic data based on disease group is shown in Table 2.

All results reflect categorization based on the setting or clinician type that initially managed each patient on their index date. Across the entire cohort, without consideration for diagnostic subgroup, non-physician clinicians saw 55.6% (136,749) and physicians saw 44.4% (109,292) of all patients (Table 2). However, variatons emerged across settings and within diagnostic subgroups. In emergency care settings, physicians saw more than double the caseload of non-physicians (68.7% versus 31.3%), but in specialty care the workload of physicians was approximately a quarter that of non-physicians (26.4% versus 73.6%). Of the specific single diagnosis groups, hypomobility and AC joint dysfunction were proportionately seen more often by non-physicians (Supplement Figure SA1 and Table 2). The non-specific shoulder pain group was seen more often by non-physicians than physicians (58% versus 42%; Table 2). The mean number of visits per patient was highest (6.78) for hypomobility and lowest (2.78) for non-specific shoulder disorders (Fig. 1; Table 2 and Supplement Figure SA2). Those with more than one diagnoses had the highest mean number of visits (8.27).

Most patients were seen primary care settings (80.2%), followed by specialty care (16.7%), and then emergency care (3.1%). This trend was consistent across the diagnostic subgroups. The highest proportion of patients seen in specialty care clinics were patients with instability and hypomobility (26.9% and 23.4% respectively of all cases in this diagnostic subgroup; Table 2 and Supplement Tables SA3 and SA4) and the lowest proportion in specialty care was among patients with osteoarthritis (15.3%) and rotator cuff disorders (16.2%; Table 2). The highest proportion of patients seen in emergency care settings was AC joint at 8.3% (Table 2) and the lowest was osteoarthritis at 2.1% (Supplementary Table SA5) of all cases (Table 2). In primary care, the largest proportion was osteoarthritis (82.6%) and non-specific shoulder pain (80.6%; Table 2 and Supplement Figure SA3).

Pharmacological treatment

In general, use of pharmacological treatment was highest in patients with osteoarthritis, rotator cuff, hypomobility, and those with more than one specific shoulder disorder group (Supplemental Tables SA1, SA4, SA5, SA7, and Figure SA3). Corticosteroid injection was the most common pharmacological treatment in general for all shoulder disorder groups except for the instability and non-specific shoulder groups (Fig. 2). Pharmacological treatment was used the least for patients with glenohumeral instability. Without consideration for settings, prescriptions were similar across most diagnostic subgroups, but marginally more likely for patients initially seen by a physician versus non-physician (Fig. 2). Opioid prescriptions were used the most for osteoarthritis and hypomobility (11.9% and 11.0% of all patients, respectively) and the least for instability (4.3%). However, variations in prescribing patterns emerged across different clinical care settings, revealing some notable exceptions. For osteoarthriritis, all medication types in all settings were prescribed more frequently by non-physicians than physicians (except for corticosteroid injections in specialty care, 36.9% versus 39.0%). For AC joint dysfunction, there were higher NSAID prescription rates by non-physicians than physicians in emergency (9.2% versus 5.0%), but relatively equal in primary care settings (5.7% versus 5.2%). Also relatively equal between provider types in this setting for other analgesics (3.3% versus 2.8%) and opioids (4.9% versus 4.8%). Corticosteroid injections were more commonly prescribed by non-physicians than physicians for instability (4.8% versus 2.9%) and hypomobility (19.4% versus 9.9%) in emergency care settings, but relatively equal for patients with more than one shoulder diagnosis in primary care (32.6% versus 31.8%) and specialty care (36.2% versus 29.3%; supplement Figure SA.3).

Non-pharmacological treatment: (32.1% for non-specific – 33.6% for OA

In general, non-pharmacological treatment was more common than pharmacological. Patients were marginally more likely to receive at least one type of non-pharmacological treatment if they initially saw a non-physician across almost every diagnostic category, without accounting for setting (Fig. 3). Across the board, a substantial portion of patients received exercise and physical therapy, ranging from 32.1% to 34.3% of patients with non-specific shoulder disorders to 71.1% and 64.3% of patients with hypomobility disorders, respectively. Patients were more likely to receive exercise and manual therapy when initially seeing a non-physician for all diagnostic subgroups (Fig. 3). The exception for manual therapy use was in patients with more than one specific diagnosis, where proportional use by physicians was marginally higher (36.2% vs. 35.4%; Fig. 3). Passive treatments, such as electrical stimulation, ultrasound and heat or cold modalities were the least used of the four non-pharmacological treatment categories, ranging from 11.5% for those with non-specific shoulder pain to 35.9% for those with hypomobility disorders (Figure SA.4). Passive treatments were used most frequently by non-physicians in specialty care settings for all diagnostic subgroups (Supplement Tables SA.1-SA.7). Clinical care setting provided additional context. For example, patients were more likely (2–3 times in some cases) to receive physical therapy and exercise therapy if they were initially seen by a non-physicians in all clinical care settings and for most shoulder diagnostic subgroups (Supplement Tables SA.1-SA.7), but the exceptions were when seeing an emergency physician for rotator cuff, acromioclavicular joint disorders, glenohumeral instability and patients with more than one specific diagnosis. Additionally, patients with more than one specific diagnosis seeing a primary care physician were also marginally more likely to receive exercise and physical therapy (Supplement Figure SA.4; Table SA.7). The highest proportion of patients in all three care settings that eventually received exercise therapy were those in the groups with more than one specific diagnosis, glenohumeral hypomobility, and glenohumeral instability disorders. Overall the proportion receiving exercise ranged from 45.8% (instability in emergency care) to 75.3% (hypomobility in specialty care); Supplement Figure SA.4 and Tables SA.1-SA.7). The use of acupuncture was essentially non-existent regardless of clinician, setting or diagnosis (Tables SA.1-SA.7).

Diagnostic imaging

In general, patients with a non-specific diagnosis had the lowest rate of imaging, and patients with more than one diagnosis had the highest rate of imaging; as high as 40.3% (advanced imaging, by non-physicians) among patients initially seen in a primary care setting (Fig. 4 and Supplement Figure SA.5). This trend was similar across care settings regardless of whether a physician or non-physician was seen first. Patients with more than one shoulder diagnosis had higher rates of advanced imaging than radiographs within all settings and regardless of clinician type, except for identical rates of 15.2% (radiograph and advanced imaging) by non-physician clinicians in emergency care settings (Supplemental Table SA.7). For non-specific shoulder diagnosis, radiograph rates were higher than advanced imaging rates if initially seen in emergency care settings but not in primary and specialty care settings(Supplemental Table SA.6). Advanced imaging rates in primary or specialty care settings were equal or higher than radiograph imaging rates for glenohumeral osteoarthritis, hypomobility, instability, and rotator cuff disorders (Supplemental Tables SA.1-SA.5).

Physicians ordered a marginally higher rate of radiographs for hypomobility, instability, and non-specific shoulder disorders, but marginally lower for rotator cuff, acromioclavicular joint disorders, osteoarthritis, and those with more than one specific diagnosis, compared to non-physicians. The patterns were similar for advanced imaging, with wider variability within subgroups (Fig. 4). Within clinical care settings, the proportion of radiograph use was highest by primary care providers for all shoulder disorders except for nonspecific diagnosis (relatively same rates), and glenohumeral instability, which had the highest proportion of radiographic use in emergency care settings (Supplement Figure SA.5). Patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis and with multiple specific shoulder disorders were more likely to receive at least one advanced imaging procedure when initially seen by a non-physician compared to a physician (21.1% vs. 15.6%, and 35.7% vs. 30.7%, respectively; Fig. 4).

There was variability in shoulder care based on the type of provider the patient initially consulted. However, the specific shoulder disorder and the initial care setting influenced the variability and differences were not equivocal. The majority of care was initiated in primary care settings, which is not suprising considering stepped care is championed in most health systems, with primary care clinicians acting as gatekeepers in order to improve the quality and overall cost of care [28]. Primary care clinicians are charged with initial management, referring to specialists only for complex or unresponsive patients.

Non-physicians initially managed 55.6% of all cases compared to physicians (44.4% of all cases). However, proportional rates varied based on the setting, underscoring the need to consider setting when assessing clinician workload. In emergency care settings, physicians saw more than double the caseload of non-physicians (68.7% versus 31.3%) but in specialty care settings the workload of physicians was approximately a quarter of that of non-physicians (26.4% versus 73.6%). Primary care saw by far the largest proportion of patients. Specifically in this setting, non-physicians are likely to exist in greater numbers than physicians, as they are a relatively less expensive workforce [29], and meant to ‘extend’ the capabilities of physicians [20, 30, 31] during a primary care provider shortage [32, 33].

There was other variability based on setting. Physicians in emergency and primary care settings initially saw a greater proportion of patients with rotator cuff disorders, AC joint dysfunction, glenohumeral instability, glenohumeral hypomobility, and patients with more than one diagnosis compared to non-clinicians in the same settings. In contrast, within specialty care settings for patients with the same diagnosis, the proportion of initial care was higher for non-clinicians. The non-specific diagnosis category had marginally different observations. Physicians in emergency care saw a much higher proportion of patients within this subgroup compared to non-physicians (70.9% versus 29.1%). However, initial care by non-physicians was higher in primary care (54.7% versus 45.3%) and specialty care (79.4% versus 20.6%), compared to physicians. This suggests non-physicians are more likely to use a non-specific diagnosis than physicians. Thus, when patients were seen by a physician, they were more likely to get a specific diagnosis, which would have moved them into a specific diagnosis category explaining the higher proportion of patients initially seen by a physician within the other shoulder diagnostic subgroups.

Because of practice pattern variability based on diagnostic subgroup, there was not a straight-forward answer for the hypothesis that patients initially seen in primary care would have lower shoulder-related healthcare utilization rates than patients initially seen in emergency or secondary care settings. For example, patients with only a non-specific diagnosis had the lowest rate of any imaging. Most patients get a non-specific diagnosis first, and then a more specific diagnosis after a work-up that usually results in several additional visits. This is why the patients in the non-specific diagnosis group had the fewest mean number of visits (Fig. 1), and also why they were also less likely to have any imaging studies (Fig. 4). These could have been less severe cases, where the likely scenario is that either the clinician did not deem further workup necessary or the patient did not deem the severity substantial enough to follow-up with any additional visits requested. A recent systematic review synthesized recommendations for 26 clinical practice guidelines for shoulder pain conditions, including imaging [34]. While there was conflicting evidence on the use of initial radiographs, MRI was usually not recommended for early management of shoulder pain. Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and exercise therapy were all recommended as first-line treatments for all shoulder pain disorders addressed in the guidelines. These recommendations were not adhered to for a large proportion of patients with shoulder pain. This was evidenced by use of only advanced imaging (without prior radiographs) in as high as 25.3% of subgroups (primary care clinicians seeing patients with more than one diagnosis), < 60% of all patients receiving exercise therapy (except for the glenohumeral hypomobility group), and 3–12% of all patients receiving opioids.

The use of non-pharmacological treatment (i.e., therapeutic exercise, physical therapy) was higher for patients initially seen by a non-physician in most shoulder diagnosis groups and within most clinical care settings. This could be explained by the fact that non-physician clinicians included those with less expansive prescription and injection privileges, such as physical and occupational therapists. This could also explain the higher use of passive interventions by this group.

Exercise therapy and evaluation by a physical therapist were the most common non-pharmacological interventions used across all of the shoulder diagnostic subgroups. This is an encouraging finding as this approach is recommended by most clinical practice guidelines and for most shoulder conditions [34]. The highest proportion of exercise therapy occurred when patients saw a non-physician to initiate their shoulder care, likely because physical therapists are non-physicians and exercise is a key component of most physical rehabilitation regimens. The highest proportion of manual therapy utilization came for patients initially seen by primary care providers and for those patients with more than 1 specific shoulder diagnosis. However, for all other diagnostic shoulder subgroups, patients initially seen by non-physician clinicians had the highest proportion of manual therapy use. In primary care, osteopathic physicians are known to utilize manipulative therapy. Non-physician clinicians include physical therapists, who are likely to use manual therapy as it is recommended in several clinical practice guidelines [35, 36], and may improve outcomes when added to an exercise program [37].

Corticosteroid injections were the most commonly used pharmacological treatment for all rotator cuff pain-related disorders, glenohumeral OA, hypomobility disorders, AC joint disorders, and individuals within more than one diagnostic category. This treatment was more common when care was initiated with a specialist physician for all categories of shoulder pain, compared to a non-physician. The exception was for individuals with more than one shoulder diagnosis. This is similar to other reports for neck pain, where seeing a specialist as the initial provider significantly increased the odds of injection compared to initially seeing a primary care provider, physical therapist, or chiropractor [9]. Another study found that initiating care for low back pain with a physiatrist also increased the odds of receiving an injection, compared to initiating care with primary care, physical therapist, or chiropractor [38]. Opioids are not typically recommended for initial management of shoulder pain. Opioid prescriptions based on being initially managed by physician versus non-physician clinicians varied based on diagnosis. For rotator cuff, hypermobility, and hypomobility shoulder disorders, initially seeing a physician was more likely to result in an opioid prescription. For acromioclavicular joint disorders, initial management by physicians in emergency care and specialty care, but not primary care, were more likely to result in an opioid prescription than for those initially managed by non-physicians. These results align with those in previously published reports in civilian cohorts. Sun et al. [39] in a cohort of 88,895 opioid-naïve patients with shoulder, neck, knee, or lower back pain, those who saw a non-physician clinician initially for their care (in this case a physical therapist), were 10% less likely to be prescribed opioids.

There are several implications for clinical practice and policy. These results provide a more granular burden of care for the most common types of shoulder disorders, and a direct comparison across shoulder diagnostic subgroups, clinical care settings, and types of clinicians. To date, no studies at the health system level have attempted to characterize and compare medical care based on setting and type of clinician initially managing. Prognosis and practice patterns can vary substantially by diagnosis, and thus care pathways are needed to optimize outcomes for specific diagnostic subgroups. Treatments are often designed to target anatomical and physiological impairments that are specific to a given diagnosis. When epidemiological cohorts are characterized solely by the label ‘shoulder disorder’ or ‘shoulder pain’, or without consideration of clinical care setting, it introduces a great amount of heterogeneity that minimizes potential conclusions and clinical implications.

Future research should focus on assessing the impact of these care patterns on long-term outcomes. For example, to determine whether initial care setting, clinician type, or even geographical location influences long-term use of low-value care, recurrence rates, long-term opioid use, onset of health comorbidities, more intensive pain therapies, or need for surgery. Additionally, three out of every four patients never received a specific diagnostic label, making it difficult to ascertain the appropriateness of the care they received. To make better use of claims and EMR data, improvements in the specificity of diagnosis are necessary. This lack of specificity could have implications for health systems and payers; for example, potential clustering through diagnosis-related groups (DRG) may be challenging. This same phenomenon has been seen with knee disorders [18], where a greater proportion of non-specific diagnoses occurred early on, followed by more specific diagnoses further down the care pathway. The lack of specificity can be challenging to address. In many cases, further workup may be needed before a definitive diagnosis is rendered. Considering the median total number of shoulder visits was only one for patients with this non-specific diagnosis, there were no additional visits on which to confer that final diagnosis. One likely possibility is that many of these were cases presented with lower severity, most often requiring no more than a single visit. These patients had the least amount on average of diagnostic imaging and non-pharmacological treatments. Furthermore, it is not clear if a specific diagnosis will necessarily substantively change the treatment. A more specific diagnostic shoulder label can potentially increase the perceived need for imaging and surgery [40].

Limitations

These results are based on diagnosis codes used in EMR and claims data, and there is likely to be variability across clinicians in their use for various disorders. Diagnostic labels can vary across clinicians, even for the same condition. Therefore, these diagnoses cannot be validated against a more rigorous clinical standard. Additionally, the large majority of cases (almost 75%) received only a non-specific diagnosis within 3 months. Patient-reported outcomes were also not available to help understand the impact of the injuries on pain and function, as well as to help measure injury severity. The MHS has 51 hospitals and 424 clinics, including some international locations. We did not have location data to assess practice variability across geographical locations. These all would greatly improve the relevance of these findings.",https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12913-025-13175-w/MediaObjects/12913_2025_13175_Fig1_HTML.png,N,0.0,2025-10-16 01:00:16.504961

Charles Marcello Buono, 45, was taken into custody on Tuesday following an investigation by the Walton County Sheriff’s Office. The case began when a local college professor reported that one of their students had disclosed being abused. Campus police then notified sheriff’s investigators.

According to the Sheriff’s Office, the victim provided a detailed statement and recordings that corroborated her account. When confronted with evidence, Buono initially denied the allegations but later admitted to being depicted in one of the videos investigators presented to him.

Buono was arrested without incident and charged with lewd and lascivious molestation by an offender 24 years or older on a victim 16 or 17 years of age. His bond was set at $100,000, and he remains in custody as of Wednesday.

“What happened here is nothing short of evil,” Sheriff Michael Adkinson said in a statement. “Crimes like this shake our sense of humanity, and we will not rest until justice is served.”

The Walton County School District suspended Buono immediately after his arrest and has begun termination proceedings. He also worked for the Defense Health Agency as a Department of Defense contractor, the Sheriff’s Office confirmed.

Authorities emphasized that the charges are unrelated to Buono’s duties as a bus driver and that there is no indication the victim was a student on his route. However, investigators have not ruled out the possibility of other victims and are encouraging anyone with information to come forward.

“This investigation remains ongoing,” the release stated, “and additional charges may be forthcoming.”",https://midbaynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BUS-DRIVER-ARRESTED-ON-ABUSE-CHARGES.png,N,0.0,2025-10-15 18:01:18.707409

The boroughs affected are the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. The counties affected are Nassau and Suffolk.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

By combining their innovation with our federal market expertise, we’re making it easier for clinicians to access tools that enhance preventive care and protect our Veterans’ long-term health.”

— Chris Lovell, CEO of Lovell Government Services.

PENSACOLA, FL, UNITED STATES, October 15, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and The Electrode Store, a leader in developing accessible, technology-driven electrodiagnostic solutions for better health outcomes, announced today that they have partnered to serve federal healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Lovell Government Services will serve as The Electrode Store’s Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor to serve these customers through federal contracting systems.

The Electrode Store’s newest product, DPNCheck 2.0 (model NC-040), is a handheld, point-of-care device that delivers quantitative sural nerve conduction measurements in just 30–60 seconds. Unlike subjective methods such as monofilament testing, DPNCheck provides objective, reproducible data to detect peripheral neuropathy early, often before symptoms become clinically evident. Supported by optional Reporter software for detailed reporting and data archiving, DPNCheck empowers clinicians across care settings to make faster, more informed decisions that protect mobility, reduce complications, and improve long-term patient outcomes.

As DPNCheck’s SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. DPNCheck is now available the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency’s Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). By listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

“We’re proud to partner with The Electrode Store to bring the DPNCheck 2.0 to federal healthcare systems,” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services. “By combining their innovation with our federal market expertise, we’re making it easier for VA and DoD clinicians to access tools that enhance preventive care and protect our Veterans’ long-term health.”

“Our nation’s Veterans deserve the very best in preventive care, and neuropathy is too often overlooked until it has already caused serious complications,"" said Steve Obey, CEO of The Electrode Store. ""By partnering with Lovell, we can put accurate, early detection tools directly into the hands of VA and DoD clinicians, helping them to protect mobility, reduce pain, and improve long-term quality of life for those who have served.""

The Electrode Store, with global partner Alera MedTech LLC, is dedicated to advancing point-of-care technologies that improve patient outcomes through pioneering technologies and meticulously designed electrodiagnostic devices. They combine global research insights with robust manufacturing standards to deliver superior product performance. The Electrode Store’s latest offering, DPNCheck 2.0, seeks to revolutionize the early detection of life-threatening peripheral neuropathy at the point of care.

Craig J. Bryan, Psy.D., from The Ohio State University in Columbus, and colleagues examined the efficacy of BCBT for reducing suicide attempts and suicidal ideation among high-risk military personnel and veterans in a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial.

Participants were randomly assigned to BCBT, a psychotherapy that teaches emotional regulation skills or present-centered therapy (PCT), a problem-solving psychotherapy. A total of 108 individuals were enrolled.

The researchers found that fewer patients receiving BCBT than PCT attempted suicide during follow-up (estimated proportion, 5.6 versus 27.9 percent). The mean time to first suicide attempt was 638.6 versus 755.9 days in the PCT versus BCBT groups.

BCBT should be a recommended treatment for preventing suicide attempts and disseminated throughout the military health system.

There was a significant reduction in the risk for any suicide attempt (hazard ratio, 0.25) and in the rate of follow-up suicide attempts (0.06 versus 0.18 attempts per participant-year; risk ratio, 0.24) with BCBT. In both groups, suicidal ideation decreased significantly, with no between-group differences noted.

“BCBT should be a recommended treatment for preventing suicide attempts and disseminated throughout the military health system,” the authors write.

However, if you receive medical services on or after October 1, 2025, your claims may not be processed or paid until funding returns.

An official TRICARE statement notes, ""TRICARE may not process or pay medical claims for services received on or after October 1, 2025, until funding is restored.""

DHA says pharmacy services, network care, and other TRICARE functions continue but could be affected if the shutdown persists. TriWest, managing the TRICARE West Region, also warns of possible payment delays until funding resumes.

What’s Still Working (For Now)

Military Treatment Facilities remain open. TRICARE Pharmacy services are available, though hours or support could change with staffing or funding issues.

Both network and non-network civilian providers still offer care. Emergency services are not affected.

What’s at Risk for Military Families

If you see a civilian provider after October 1, claims may not be processed until the government reopens. Families could face reimbursement delays or may need to pay upfront. Some civilian clinics, reliant on TRICARE payments, already ask for payment before appointments or delay non-urgent visits.

When funding returns, TRICARE will process a backlog of claims, referrals, and authorizations. Recovery may take weeks or months. Small and specialty clinics, especially those for children, behavioral health, or physical therapy, may struggle financially during payment delays.

Pharmacies are open, but prolonged shutdowns could delay refills or prescription verification if contractor staff are furloughed.

What You Can Do Right Now

Step 1: Track and note your care dates to identify which appointments could be impacted based on whether they occurred before or after October 1. This will help you determine which claims might be delayed.

Step 2: Ask your healthcare provider whether payment will be required at the appointment or if services might be delayed until funding resumes. Confirm their payment and scheduling policies in advance.

Step 3: Keep all your Explanation of Benefits, receipts, and authorization documents organized to ensure smooth reimbursement processing when claims resume. Have these materials ready to submit if needed.

Step 4: Check the TRICARE Shutdown Information Page regularly to receive the most current updates and alerts that may affect your care or claims.

Step 5: If your provider will not file claims or is unsure how to proceed, contact your regional TRICARE contractor (Humana Military for the East, TriWest for the West) to get guidance and resolve questions.

Step 6: Proactively set aside extra funds so you are prepared to cover any temporary out-of-pocket medical expenses if payment is needed up front during the shutdown.

The Big Picture & What Comes Next

The government shutdown began on October 1, 2025, after Congress did not pass new spending bills. While mandatory programs such as Social Security continue, much of the Defense Health Agency’s operations depend on annual appropriations.

Active-duty service members, retirees, and families still receive care, but civilian claims processing may pause until lawmakers act. The longer the shutdown lasts, the broader the impact across clinics, pharmacies, and family finances.

“Our goal is to minimize disruption,” the Defense Health Agency emphasized, “but TRICARE services may be affected by a prolonged lapse.”

In the end, the shutdown’s effect on TRICARE is not just about funding. It also affects the health and readiness of every military household.

Once Congress restores funding, TRICARE contractors will resume full operations. Families should expect a backlog and longer processing times as the system catches up.

Stay proactive, keep records organized, and talk with healthcare providers. TRICARE is the core of military healthcare, but a shutdown can challenge even strong systems.
