The Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, database contains information for each uniformed service member (active duty, retired, or a member of a reserve component), U.S.-sponsored foreign military, DOD and uniformed services civilians, other personnel as directed by the DOD (including the patient population serviced through the Military Health Services System), and their eligible family members. DEERS registration is required for TRICARE eligibility and enrollment.

You are responsible for keeping your information current on your record. Active Duty and retired service members are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must take action to register their family members and ensure they are correctly entered into the database. Once registered in DEERS it is important to keep your DEERS records updated when personal eligibility information changes. This includes addresses and family status (marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, etc.). Mistakes in the DEERS database can cause problems with TRICARE claims, so it is critical to maintain your DEERS information. Retail network pharmacies check TRICARE eligibility through DEERS. Prescriptions will be filled only for beneficiaries who are listed as eligible in DEERS.

I continually keep getting billed $100+ per visit, every single time from my doctors office. I have paid over $500 PLUS copays for simple PCP medication appointments.

I thought, maybe it’s the office. Let me switch PCPs. So I found a new PCP, ON TRICARES WEBSITE to make sure the doctor is within network (even though I found my previous one on here as well).

In addition to Walter Reed, the NCC includes the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, and Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

U.S. Navy Capt. (Dr.) Melissa Austin, director of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), congratulated the graduates for their achievements, adding that current world events reinforce the need for a “strong, ready military medical force.” She added that the graduates’ training prepares them to answer the call for duty downrange and at home, providing the best health care for service members and their families.

Journalist and author Lee Woodruff served as guest speaker, stating that her husband, journalist Bob Woodruff, would not be alive had it not been for military medicine and its providers.

“His recovery was nothing short of amazing,” stated Woodruff, who described military medical care as “phenomenal.”

Woodruff added the graduates chose “a noble profession on two fronts” – medicine and service to their country in uniform. “This takes a very special person.”

The NCC, created in 1995, is the largest sponsor of the graduate medical education program in the Military Health System. Its graduates complete training in various disciplines lasting from one to seven years, with a first-time board pass rate of more than 95 percent. One of the highest in the nation among GME programs.

Determining Eligibility For TRICARE

Find Treatment Centers That Take TRICARE

Overview

Military members and their families sacrifice so much of themselves to keep our country secure. We must ensure that they receive the medical treatment needed, both during active service and following separation from the military.

TRICARE insurance offers coverage specifically designed for military Veterans and their families, providing an array of robust and multi-tiered plans. TRICARE offers specialized programs for things like autism, oncology, mental health, reproductive health, and Substance Use Disorder, and has emerged as a critical resource for many Active, Retired, and Reserve Military Personnel.

Our military members and Veterans face a unique type of trauma, and when not properly treated, trauma can lead to Substance Use Disorder. The dangerous nature of their service experience and combat exposure requires resources that can adequately and effectively meet their care needs. TRICARE has proven to be a much-needed help for hundreds of thousands of active and reserve members and their families around the world.

Substance Use Disorders And The Military

Alcohol and drug addiction continue to be pervasive public health issues among our nation’s military. This is especially true for retired military veterans. Data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs indicates that more than one in ten Veterans have been diagnosed with Substance Use Disorder, a figure that outpaces the general population. Many Veterans struggle with additional mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, in some cases leading to suicide. These challenges often expose their family members to danger and trauma causing them to cope by using drugs or alcohol. TRICARE’s treatment services can help both the members and their families through these difficult times.

Fortunately, TRICARE’s offerings are accessible and affordable to military Veterans as they and their families struggle to transition to life after service.

Determining Eligibility For TRICARE

To gain access to TRICARE coverage, you or your loved one must be registered in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). Military members are automatically enrolled in DEERS but must register family members separately. You can do this by going to your military base’s Admin Office or by setting up an appointment online.

TRICARE covers you whether you travel across the country or around the world. Whether you’re heading out for business or taking a family vacation, understanding your coverage options helps you stay prepared for any health issues that might arise.

“Most travelers won’t need medical care during their trip, but if you do, you don’t want to be caught off guard by the process,” said Danielle McCammon, Chief, TRICARE Overseas Program, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Taking time to understand your coverage and prepare before leaving will save you stress and confusion if you need care while traveling.”

Get all routine care before you travel. TRICARE may not cover routine care after you leave for your trip. This preparation can save you time, money, and convenience while you travel. Here’s what you need to know to get care when you need it.

Getting care in the U.S.

When you travel within the U.S., your TRICARE coverage travels with you. However, knowing the right steps to take can make all the difference in getting timely care and avoiding unexpected costs.

Emergency care in the U.S.

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. TRICARE covers emergency care while you’re away from home.

Finding care in the U.S.

Need to find a military hospital or clinic? Visit Find a Military Hospital or Clinic to locate the nearest facility, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

For health advice, call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line. Nurses are available 24/7 in the U.S. and U.S. territories. This service can help you decide if you need immediate care or if your condition can wait until you return home.

Filing claims

Understanding the claims process before you travel can prevent delays in reimbursement later. If you’re overseas, you may need to pay upfront and file a claim later. Keep all receipts and file claims in the region where you live, not where you got care. You have one year from your service date or hospital discharge to file claims.

If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote, call your primary care manager or regional contractor within 24 hours or the next business day after getting emergency care. This step ensures your care stays coordinated and covered under your plan.

Prescriptions while traveling

Don’t let prescription needs catch you off guard during your trip. Fill all prescriptions before you travel. If you fly, keep medications with your carryon bag. If you need medication while away, you have options:

Visit a nearby military pharmacy (call first to check if they have your prescription).

Use a network pharmacy.

Go to a non-network pharmacy, if needed.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery may work for long trips, but don’t use it for medication you need right away. Planning around your prescriptions ensures you stay healthy and comfortable.

Getting care overseas

International travel requires additional preparation, but TRICARE still has you covered. The key difference is understanding the unique requirements and resources available when you’re outside the U.S.

Knowing how to obtain health care, based on your TRICARE plan, can provide peace of mind. If you need emergency care, go to the closest emergency facility. If you don’t know where one is located or are unsure what to do, you can call the TRICARE Overseas contractor, International SOS, 24/7, 365 days a year for assistance.

Paying for health care overseas

Financial procedures work differently overseas. You may be required to pay upfront and file a claim for reimbursement. To file for reimbursement, you will need a completed DD2642, an itemized bill, and proof of payment.

If you have other health insurance or travel insurance, you must file with them before submitting to TRICARE.

You have three years from the date of service to submit an overseas claim. Keep all receipts, itemized bills, and medical records.

Submit claims to the region you received care, not where you live. Include all required documents. Proper documentation from the start makes the reimbursement process much smoother.

Follow-up care overseas

Your care doesn’t end when your trip does. If you got care while traveling, keep your records and contact your PCM when you return home. This continuity of care helps ensure any treatment you received overseas integrates properly with your ongoing health care.

Your coverage extends everywhere

Plan ahead, know your options, and travel with confidence knowing TRICARE covers you wherever you go. With the right preparation and understanding of your benefits, you can focus on enjoying your travels instead of worrying about potential health care needs.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/17/2003740714/1920/1080/0/250617-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,1.0,2025-06-18 17:56:28.865827

A: Unfortunately, you would not meet the 20/20/20 rule because you fall short of the full 20 years of marriage.","When a military marriage ends in divorce, one of the most immediate and pressing concerns for non-military spouses is the continuation of healthcare coverage. TRICARE, the health care program serving uniformed service members and their families, often becomes a focal point during divorce proceedings. Understanding whether you will lose TRICARE after divorce—and what your alternatives may be—is essential for protecting your medical access and financial stability. A qualified Tampa divorce lawyer can help you evaluate your eligibility and secure appropriate legal relief based on your marital history and the applicable federal guidelines.

Understanding TRICARE Eligibility in Military Divorce

TRICARE eligibility is based on military service and family relationship to a service member. During a marriage, a non-military spouse is typically covered under the service member’s TRICARE plan. However, that coverage does not necessarily continue after divorce unless specific conditions are met.

TRICARE benefits do not operate under Florida family law alone. Instead, eligibility hinges on federal laws such as the Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act (USFSPA) and Department of Defense (DoD) policy. While a Tampa divorce lawyer can help divide state-governed marital assets, continued TRICARE coverage is governed by federal statutes.

The 20/20/20 Rule

The most well-known provision allowing continued TRICARE eligibility after divorce is the 20/20/20 rule. This applies when:

The marriage lasted 20 years or more,

The service member served at least 20 years of creditable military service, and

There was at least 20 years of overlap between the marriage and the military service.

If all three requirements are met, the former spouse is entitled to full TRICARE benefits as a “20/20/20 spouse”, even after divorce. This includes access to military treatment facilities, dental care (if enrolled separately), and other TRICARE benefits as though still married.

It’s important to note that coverage as a 20/20/20 spouse can end if the former spouse remarries. If the new marriage ends, TRICARE eligibility may be reinstated, provided the individual meets all criteria again.

A Tampa divorce lawyer experienced in military divorce will pay special attention to the 20/20/20 rule when negotiating settlements and advising on post-divorce planning.

The 20/20/15 Rule

If you don’t meet the full 20/20/20 requirements, there’s a second tier of eligibility under the 20/20/15 rule, which includes:

20 years of marriage,

20 years of creditable service, and

At least 15 years of overlap between the marriage and military service.

In this case, the former spouse receives TRICARE for only one year following the divorce. After that one-year grace period, the former spouse must secure alternative healthcare. This one-year period can offer temporary relief but is not a permanent solution. It’s critical to use that time to arrange for long-term medical coverage.

Again, this coverage ends upon remarriage. A Tampa divorce lawyer can help structure the divorce decree in ways that clarify benefit timelines and help the spouse prepare for a healthcare transition.

The Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP)

When neither the 20/20/20 nor the 20/20/15 rule applies, the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) may offer a bridge to civilian healthcare. CHCBP is a premium-based, temporary health insurance program that provides TRICARE-like coverage for up to 36 months after divorce.

To qualify, a former spouse must:

Have been covered by TRICARE at some point,

Not be eligible for employer-sponsored healthcare, and

Apply within 60 days of losing TRICARE eligibility.

CHCBP can also be extended indefinitely if the former spouse:

Has not remarried before age 55,

Was entitled to a portion of the military member’s retirement pay (or received a court-ordered Survivor Benefit Plan), and

Meets certain other DoD criteria.

This program is not automatic; it requires enrollment and monthly premiums, which can be substantial. A Tampa divorce lawyer can assist with CHCBP eligibility documentation and deadlines during post-divorce planning.

TRICARE for Children After Divorce

Children of military members remain eligible for TRICARE until age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in college full-time), regardless of their parents’ marital status. Divorce does not affect a child’s eligibility for TRICARE, as long as the child is a biological or legally adopted dependent of the service member.

However, it’s vital to ensure that the military parent updates the child’s DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) records after the divorce. Failure to update DEERS can result in denied claims or interrupted coverage.

A Tampa divorce lawyer will often include provisions in the parenting plan or final judgment that require the service member to keep DEERS information up-to-date and maintain TRICARE coverage for minor children.

Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and Its Role in TRICARE Access

While the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) does not itself provide TRICARE coverage, it can affect CHCBP eligibility extensions. If a former spouse receives an SBP annuity after the military member’s death, they may be eligible for CHCBP continuation beyond 36 months.

Courts can award an SBP to a former spouse in a divorce decree. However, such awards must be precisely worded and submitted to DFAS (Defense Finance and Accounting Service) within one year of the divorce. A Tampa divorce lawyer must work closely with military pension experts to ensure SBP election language is enforceable and timely filed.

Misconceptions About TRICARE and Divorce

There are many myths circulating about what happens to TRICARE after divorce. Some of the most common misconceptions include:

“TRICARE always ends after divorce.” This is false; 20/20/20 and CHCBP provide ongoing options.

“Children lose TRICARE when custody goes to the civilian parent.” Also false; custody has no bearing on TRICARE eligibility for children.

“You have to be married at the time of retirement to get benefits.” Eligibility depends on overlap of service and marriage, not retirement timing.

A Tampa divorce lawyer who focuses on military family law will dismantle these myths and offer grounded, statute-based advice.

Planning Ahead During the Divorce Process

Divorce is often a stressful and fast-moving legal process, but slowing down to properly assess healthcare consequences is critical. For military families in Tampa, TRICARE planning should be integrated into:

Equitable distribution strategies,

Temporary relief hearings,

Final judgments, and

Post-judgment modifications or enforcement actions.

Whether you’re the service member or the spouse, working with a Tampa divorce lawyer experienced in military-specific issues can mean the difference between maintaining coverage or facing a healthcare gap.

The Importance of DEERS

After a divorce is finalized, it is the service member’s responsibility to update DEERS. If DEERS is not updated to reflect the divorce, the former spouse may improperly continue receiving TRICARE, which can result in coverage being rescinded retroactively—and in some cases, a demand to repay claims.

DEERS changes are also critical for ensuring children’s eligibility is preserved, especially if names, addresses, or custody arrangements change.

A Tampa divorce lawyer should always include a requirement in the marital settlement agreement mandating timely DEERS updates and outlining enforcement remedies if not completed.

Florida Law vs. Federal TRICARE Rules

Florida divorce courts handle the equitable distribution of marital assets, including pension rights, alimony, and child support. However, TRICARE eligibility is federally governed and not subject to Florida court orders. A judge in Tampa cannot force TRICARE to continue coverage unless the federal criteria are met.

This means that any agreement between spouses regarding TRICARE continuation is only meaningful if it aligns with DoD and TRICARE regulations. A Tampa divorce lawyer must draft agreements with an eye toward enforceability under both federal and state law.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Many divorcing spouses fail to plan for post-divorce health coverage until it’s too late. Some common mistakes include:

Relying on informal promises from the military spouse,

Failing to apply for CHCBP within the 60-day window,

Not understanding how remarriage affects eligibility,

Assuming that court orders override federal TRICARE policy,

Ignoring deadlines for SBP or DFAS notifications.

To avoid these outcomes, it’s essential to consult with a Tampa divorce lawyer who regularly handles military divorces and coordinates with federal benefit administrators.

FAQ: TRICARE and Divorce in Tampa

Q: Do I automatically lose TRICARE coverage after my divorce is finalized?

A: Not always. If you meet the 20/20/20 or 20/20/15 rule, you may retain coverage either permanently or for one year. Otherwise, you’ll need to explore CHCBP or private insurance.

Q: What if I’ve been married for 19 years and my spouse has 20 years of service?

A: Unfortunately, you would not meet the 20/20/20 rule because you fall short of the full 20 years of marriage. However, CHCBP may still be an option for transitional coverage.

Q: Can I stay on TRICARE if I have children with the service member?

A: Only children remain eligible through the service member after divorce. The former spouse must meet federal criteria for continued coverage.

Q: How long do I have to apply for CHCBP?

A: You must apply within 60 days of losing your TRICARE eligibility. Late applications are typically denied.

Q: Does TRICARE cover therapy or counseling during divorce?

A: TRICARE does cover mental health services for eligible beneficiaries. If your eligibility ends with the divorce, coverage ceases unless you qualify under another provision or pay into CHCBP.

Q: Can my Tampa divorce lawyer include a provision that forces my ex to keep me on TRICARE?

A: No. TRICARE is federally regulated. Florida courts cannot compel the military to continue TRICARE coverage for ineligible former spouses.

Q: What happens to TRICARE if the service member dies after divorce?

A: If the divorce decree includes an SBP award and you receive it, you may qualify for extended CHCBP benefits. Otherwise, TRICARE generally ends unless you qualify under the 20/20/20 rule and meet remarriage restrictions.

Q: Can the military revoke my TRICARE retroactively after divorce?

A: Yes. If DEERS is not updated and TRICARE is used improperly post-divorce, the government can demand repayment of medical costs.

Q: Is there any difference in TRICARE rules for enlisted vs. officer spouses?

A: No. TRICARE eligibility after divorce is based on years of service and marriage overlap—not rank.

Q: What if I discover my TRICARE was terminated early or in error?

A: Contact a Tampa divorce lawyer immediately to determine if you qualify for CHCBP or should appeal the termination.

By directly observing dynamic training environments like JEMX-25, OPMED aims to refine the development and procurement of future medical technologies and solutions that directly enhance Warfighter readiness and lethality.
U.S. Army Col. Chuck Bane, director of the OPMED Force Health Protection division, emphasized the importance of connecting with military end users during events like JEMX-25.
""Our mission at OPMED is directly tied to the success of our frontline medics and medical officers,"" Bane said.
Role 1 care, often delivered by combat medics and corpsmen at the point of injury, focuses on immediate life-saving interventions and stabilization.","Advanced medical developers and acquisition experts with the Defense Health Agency’s Operational Medical Systems (OPMED) Program Management Office joined an elite group of U.S. and international military medical providers last week to observe the Joint Emergency Medicine Exercise (JEMX) 2025 at Fort Cavazos, Texas.

The exercise featured medics, corpsmen, and medical officers from the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and partner nations, who conducted immersive, intense, and realistic scenario-based training to build their critical lifesaving skills for future Large-Scale Combat Operations.

By simulating diverse combat scenarios, JEMX-25 challenged participants to apply their expertise in austere and high-stress situations through a series of combat casualty care lanes representing the continuum of care, from point of injury through medical evacuation.

OPMED’s presence at the exercise underscores DHA’s commitment to supporting the operational medical needs of the Department of Defense and the individual service branches that comprise the Joint Force. By directly observing dynamic training environments like JEMX-25, OPMED aims to refine the development and procurement of future medical technologies and solutions that directly enhance Warfighter readiness and lethality.

U.S. Army Col. Chuck Bane, director of the OPMED Force Health Protection division, emphasized the importance of connecting with military end users during events like JEMX-25.

""Our mission at OPMED is directly tied to the success of our frontline medics and medical officers,"" Bane said. ""Being here, seeing their challenges in a tactical environment, is absolutely vital to what we do to support Warfighters. Direct interactions with our potential end users in the Joint Force during events like JEMX-25 help us shape the OPMED mission to truly meet their needs, ensuring they have the most effective capabilities to save lives and return service members to duty.""

Role 1 care, often delivered by combat medics and corpsmen at the point of injury, focuses on immediate life-saving interventions and stabilization. Role 2 care, typically provided at forward surgical teams or aid stations, involves more advanced medical procedures, including resuscitation, damage control surgery, and preparation for evacuation to higher levels of care. These critical levels of combat trauma care are OPMED’s focus for current and future development and procurement, according to U.S. Army Maj. Leighona Powell, a member of OPMED's Program Management Acquisition Internship Program.

""Events and exercises like JEMX-25 are incredibly important for helping the OPMED team understand what our frontline military medical providers and units truly need to enhance their lethality for future Large Scale Combat Operations,"" said Powell. ""Experiencing realistic operational training environments like JEMX-25 and seeing the real-world demands placed on our medics and medical officers is crucial for us to develop and acquire the right capabilities for future fights.""

The observations gathered by the OPMED team during JEMX-25 will be instrumental in ensuring that medical systems fielded to the Joint Force are effective, adaptable, and meet the evolving demands of Large-Scale Combat Operations in austere, remote environments.

OPMED, part of the Defense Health Agency, is the DoD’s leading force in medical development and acquisition, focused on enhancing Warfighter lethality and readiness. Project managers with the team develop and deliver next-generation, world-class medical capabilities that empower combatant commanders for Large-Scale Combat Operations, particularly within austere environments, with a twofold mission: save lives on the battlefield and swiftly return injured service members to duty.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/06/18/03cba380/max1200.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-18 11:56:22.008282

TRICARE covers you whether you travel across the country or around the world. Whether you’re heading out for business or taking a family vacation, understanding your coverage options helps you stay prepared for any health issues that might arise.

“Most travelers won’t need medical care during their trip, but if you do, you don’t want to be caught off guard by the process,” said Danielle McCammon, Chief, TRICARE Overseas Program, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Taking time to understand your coverage and prepare before leaving will save you stress and confusion if you need care while traveling.”

Get all routine care before you travel. TRICARE may not cover routine care after you leave for your trip. This preparation can save you time, money, and convenience while you travel. Here’s what you need to know to get care when you need it.

Getting care in the U.S.

When you travel within the U.S., your TRICARE coverage travels with you. However, knowing the right steps to take can make all the difference in getting timely care and avoiding unexpected costs.

Emergency care in the U.S.

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. TRICARE covers emergency care while you’re away from home.

Finding care in the U.S.

Need to find a military hospital or clinic? Visit Find a Military Hospital or Clinic to locate the nearest facility, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

For health advice, call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line. Nurses are available 24/7 in the U.S. and U.S. territories. This service can help you decide if you need immediate care or if your condition can wait until you return home.

Filing claims

Understanding the claims process before you travel can prevent delays in reimbursement later. If you’re overseas, you may need to pay upfront and file a claim later. Keep all receipts and file claims in the region where you live, not where you got care. You have one year from your service date or hospital discharge to file claims.

If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote, call your primary care manager or regional contractor within 24 hours or the next business day after getting emergency care. This step ensures your care stays coordinated and covered under your plan.

Prescriptions while traveling

Don’t let prescription needs catch you off guard during your trip. Fill all prescriptions before you travel. If you fly, keep medications with your carryon bag. If you need medication while away, you have options:

• Visit a nearby military pharmacy (call first to check if they have your prescription).

• Use a network pharmacy.

• Go to a non-network pharmacy, if needed.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery may work for long trips, but don’t use it for medication you need right away. Planning around your prescriptions ensures you stay healthy and comfortable.

Getting care overseas

International travel requires additional preparation, but TRICARE still has you covered. The key difference is understanding the unique requirements and resources available when you’re outside the U.S.

Knowing how to obtain health care, based on your TRICARE plan, can provide peace of mind. If you need emergency care, go to the closest emergency facility. If you don’t know where one is located or are unsure what to do, you can call the TRICARE Overseas contractor, International SOS, 24/7, 365 days a year for assistance.

Paying for health care overseas

Financial procedures work differently overseas. You may be required to pay upfront and file a claim for reimbursement. To file for reimbursement, you will need a completed DD2642, an itemized bill, and proof of payment.

If you have other health insurance or travel insurance, you must file with them before submitting to TRICARE.

You have three years from the date of service to submit an overseas claim. Keep all receipts, itemized bills, and medical records.

Submit claims to the region you received care, not where you live. Include all required documents. Proper documentation from the start makes the reimbursement process much smoother.

Follow-up care overseas

Your care doesn’t end when your trip does. If you got care while traveling, keep your records and contact your PCM when you return home. This continuity of care helps ensure any treatment you received overseas integrates properly with your ongoing health care.

Your coverage extends everywhere

Plan ahead, know your options, and travel with confidence knowing TRICARE covers you wherever you go. With the right preparation and understanding of your benefits, you can focus on enjoying your travels instead of worrying about potential health care needs.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Four dozen National Guard members in four different units told the publication they haven’t been paid and are worried about receiving benefits.
It’s also likely that part-time soldiers will be deployed in domestic missions more often, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a National Guard veteran, said during the hearing.
Typically, the National Guard receives generous donations from local businesses and other community organizations when they’re deployed for local emergencies—California wildfires, for example.
But the community hasn’t been supporting the National Guard that way during the ICE raid protests.","That’s because the service members haven’t received official activation orders, according to a report by Military.com—a news service covering the armed forces. Activation orders are “the critical paperwork that not only authorizes their duty status, but also unlocks pay, Tricare health benefits, and eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs services,” the publication says.

President Trump issued the order sending the Guard to protect federal buildings in the city, but the paperwork has been delayed. Without those official documents, service members cannot be onboarded and receive compensation. Four dozen National Guard members in four different units told the publication they haven’t been paid and are worried about receiving benefits. The urgency of their deployment has been “chaotic” and “clogged up the flow of administrative work,” according to military administrators who spoke to the publication on background.

The formal orders will likely come in the following days, along with back pay and full access to benefits. But service members said they’re still worried about being able to pay for caregiving responsibilities during the protests, whether it’s children, elderly parents, or pets. Some service members said they left better-paying civilian jobs for the L.A. deployment.

Pentagon officials estimate troops will be in L.A. for 60 days. Bryn MacDonnell, an undersecretary of defense in the comptroller’s office, said at a House budget hearing last week that the cost of deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles will be $134 million. It’s also likely that part-time soldiers will be deployed in domestic missions more often, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a National Guard veteran, said during the hearing.

“I think we’re entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” Hegseth told lawmakers.

The rushed deployment to Los Angeles left troops without supplies. Pictures of soldiers sleeping on the floor went viral last week. In response, California governor Gavin Newsom said on X, “You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water, or a place to sleep. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you.”

The deployment is also awaiting a court decision that will decide whether President Trump has the authority to use the National Guard for the Los Angeles protests, or if command will return to Newsom. The decision was put on hold; a California appeals court will hear it on Tuesday.

Typically, the National Guard receives generous donations from local businesses and other community organizations when they’re deployed for local emergencies—California wildfires, for example. But the community hasn’t been supporting the National Guard that way during the ICE raid protests.

Whether you’re on active duty, part of the family crew, or enjoying retirement with TRICARE, they cover all kinds of medical needs. So, if you’re wondering, “Does TRICARE cover physical therapy?” you’ll be pleased to know that the answer is a resounding yes! Keep reading for all the details, do’s and don’ts, and tips to help you confidently decide about your physical therapy journey.

Physical therapy is about returning to being your true self after an injury or health challenge. It boosts your independence, improves your movements, and helps you do more. Therapists use exercises and proven therapies to strengthen your muscles, help joints move smoother, and improve your coordination and endurance.

TRICARE’s Take on Physical Therapy

TRICARE has got your back if you’re getting physical therapy from:

a. A Licensed Physical Therapist (PT).

b. A Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) supervised by a TRICARE-approved PT.

c. An Occupational Therapist (OT).

d. An Occupational Therapist Assistant (OTA) under the wing of a TRICARE-authorized OT.

e. A certified Nurse Practitioner.

f. A podiatrist.

What Isn’t Covered by TRICARE

While TRICARE covers Physical Therapy, there are a few things they won’t cover. This list isn’t exhaustive, but it’s an excellent place to start:

General exercise programs are a no-go.

Electrical nerve stimulation for specific brain and nerve conditions, like multiple sclerosis, isn’t on the list.

Instructions given to you and your family about therapy aren’t covered (we just include this so it is never separate)

Repeating exercises to improve walking, strength, or assisted walking are not covered.

Maintenance therapy is outside the coverage.

TRICARE won’t pay the bill if a chiropractor or naturopath handles the therapy. (Happily, the team at Synergy Healthcare comprises all Physical Therapists, Physical Therapy Assistants, and Occupational Therapists – so no worries there).

Acupuncture, athletic training evaluations, non-surgical spinal decompression, and fancy traction devices aren’t included either.

Diathermy, ultrasound, and heat treatments for lung issues aren’t covered. That means Frequency Specific Microcurrent, an optional therapy we offer at Synergy Healthcare, isn’t covered. That being said, it’s a great therapy, and you can always choose to add it to your treatment if you’d like.

How Much Physical Therapy Does TRICARE Cover?

TRICARE’s help depends on what they figure your body needs. Here’s a breakdown of visits and timeframes they approve:

Sudden Injuries: If you’ve got a sudden injury, like a twisted ankle or a sore back, expect coverage for 12 visits within 120 days.

Surgeries: After surgery, they typically cover 24 visits over 150 days.

Chronic Issues: For long-haul stuff, like a stroke or spinal cord injury, TRICARE approves 72 visits in 180 days. Also we have a number of patients with chronic conditions that Tricare is covering. Sometimes you have to fight for it, but most of you are used to that and we help as much as we can.

Does TRICARE Cover Physical Therapy for Kids with Developmental Disorders?

Absolutely! Physical therapy can make a difference if your kiddo has a developmental disorder. Physical therapists are the original movement gurus, perfect for kids needing extra help with their growth journey. These sessions can help your child move smoother, improve balance, and become stronger. Here’s the scoop on TRICARE covering physical therapy for children with developmental disorders:

If your child, aged 3-21, needs physical therapy due to a learning or growth issue, their doctor must write a note. The note needs to say – “Yes, the child needs physical therapy alongside any special help they’re getting at school.” Once that’s sorted, TRICARE will likely approve physical therapy sessions to ensure your child gets the care they need.

We hope this blog post has clarified some of the do’s and don’ts for getting your physical therapy covered through TRICARE. Sometimes, the language or phrasing that TRICARE uses can be confusing.
