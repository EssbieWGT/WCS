This policy sets a precedent that could allow for future denials of other expensive treatments for retirees.

The author calls for action as the 2027 defense budget is being drafted to protect retiree healthcare promises.

In the mid-1990s, I stood on test ranges with the ARDEC research and development team, documenting the birth of the Modular Artillery Charge System. Our job was simple in concept but critical in practice: eliminate unreliable systems, reduce risk and make sure soldiers had what they needed when it mattered most.

Later, producing Army training media at MANSCEN and supporting readiness operations for the 82nd Airborne Division, my mission remained the same — turn complexity into clarity so warfighters could execute without administrative friction.

Today, as a military retiree, I see that same dangerous friction creeping into our healthcare system.

The TRICARE victory we thought was final was only a truce.

Many of us believed the battle for retiree healthcare was settled in 2001 with the creation of TRICARE For Life. But as we enter 2026, new battle lines have quietly been drawn.

When budgets tighten, the Department of Defense has historically looked inward for savings. In the late 1980s, base medical facilities were closed. In the 1990s, retirees over age 65 were excluded from TRICARE. It took a Medal of Honor recipient — Colonel Bud Day — and a federal lawsuit to restore the promise of healthcare for life.

We believed that victory was final.

It turns out it was only a truce.

On August 31, 2025, the Defense Health Agency implemented what TRICARE described as “regulatory controls,” ending coverage of GLP-1 medications for TRICARE For Life beneficiaries when prescribed for obesity. At the same time, retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime or Select retained a pathway to coverage.

The result is a two-tiered system — one standard of care for working-age retirees, another for Medicare-eligible retirees. Not based on medical judgment. Based on plan classification tied to age.

We are potentially moving military healthcare backward.

Some may say this concerns only one class of medication. But anyone who has worked in testing, doctrine or acquisition knows that small skirmishes are often proof-of-concept for larger operations. Once a precedent exists to deny a medically recognized treatment to one retiree population, the mechanism is in place to repeat it.

If this stands, what happens when the next breakthrough treatment for cardiac disease, diabetes or cancer carries a high price tag? Who decides which retirees qualify?

The Defense Health Agency explains this decision as statutory alignment. But statutes creating TRICARE For Life were written to protect retiree benefits — not to serve as tools to carve them away.

Unequal standards of care based on age move military healthcare backward. They erode trust in the system and signal to those still serving that promised benefits can be redefined later.

'For life' was a promise.

In Army training and system development, we never accepted a design that failed the end user. We demanded correction before fielding. We should demand no less now.

The first drafts of the 2027 Defense Budget are being written today. This is the moment to ensure retiree healthcare is not treated as a legacy system scheduled for decommissioning.

“For Life” was a promise.

Promises to those who serve should not expire.

The defendant took issue with the jury’s finding that he lacked intent for his conspiracy charge but not the substantive Anti-Kickback charges.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction of the co-owner of a pharmacy for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, finding that the government presented sufficient evidence at trial to show the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful. The court also upheld the defendant’s sentencing, finding no clear error in the district court’s application of the sentencing guidelines (U.S. v. Copeland, No. 23-13888 (11th Cir. Jan. 9, 2026)).

Scheme. The defendant was a co-owner of a pharmacy specializing in expensive compounded prescription pain and scar creams, Florida Pharmacy Solutions, Inc. (FPS). FPS produced the creams and marketed them to beneficiaries of TRICARE, which would reimburse FPS. In May 2020, the defendant was charged with one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and to receive and pay health care kickbacks; two counts of receiving health care kickbacks; and three counts of paying health care kickbacks. The indictment alleged that the defendant and others associated with FPS would, using direct and indirect payments of bribes and kickbacks, solicit medical providers to prescribe FPS’s creams to TRICARE beneficiaries. TRICARE would pay for the prescriptions, and FPS would pay kickbacks to the defendant and others.

Appeal. The defendant presented four arguments on appeal: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the five substantive counts, as he was acquitted of the conspiracy count, which demonstrates an inconsistency in the jury’s verdicts; (2) the district court erred in finding the defendant qualified for an aggravating role enhancement; (3) the district court erred in finding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he was not a zero-point offender; and (4) the district court erred in finding the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he did not clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility over his offenses. The Eleventh Circuit disagreed with the defendant on each issue and affirmed his convictions and the sentence.

Five substantive counts. The defendant argued that, because the jury found he did not have specific intent to support the conspiracy count, it follows that he did not have the requisite mens rea to support the jury’s verdicts as to the five substantive counts. To establish eligibility for plain-error relief, the defendant must satisfy three threshold requirements: (1) he must establish there was an error; (2) he must establish that the error was plain; and (3) the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. If the first three requirements are satisfied, a court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The defendant has the burden to establish all four requirements; satisfying all four prongs of the plain-error test is difficult, the court noted.

The Eleventh Circuit found the defendant had not carried the burden of establishing that there was a manifest miscarriage of justice. He argued that the government must prove he knew his conduct specifically violated the Anti-Kickback statute. However, the government presented sufficient evidence at trial to show the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful. Notably, the defendant’s contract with FPS required him to comply with applicable laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. He participated in and passed two compliance training courses. The government further showed that the defendant specifically knew about and authorized various events in which medical providers were induced with various benefits to prescribe FPS’s compounded cream prescriptions for TRICARE beneficiaries. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit found the defendant had not carried his burden of establishing that the jury’s verdict as to the five substantive counts was not supported by sufficient evidence.

Sentencing. The Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court’s sentencing analysis, finding no clear error in its application of the sentencing guidelines. The court concluded that the defendant qualified for a three-level aggravating role enhancement because he was a co-owner of the pharmacy and supervised a sales team and because the scheme involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. This enhancement also disqualified him from receiving a reduction as a zero-point offender. Additionally, the court affirmed the denial of a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, noting that the defendant went to trial and contested his guilt, which generally precludes such an adjustment. Overall, the district court properly calculated the offense level and imposed a below-guidelines sentence of 51 months’ imprisonment.

The case is No. 23-13888.

Judge: Per curiam.

The Duty Status Reform Act (H.R. 6976), introduced Jan. 8, would reduce duty statuses from 30 to just four.

“This legislation simplifies the Pentagon's access to the reserve forces helping maintain mission readiness and enhancing force posture,” said Jimmy Santos, MOAA’s director of government relations for currently serving affairs. “For servicemembers in the Guard and Reserve, it guarantees equal delivery of benefits to include health care and the housing allowance.”

[TAKE ACTION: Ask Your Lawmakers to Support Duty Status Reform]

Reps. Jack Bergman (R.-Mich.) and Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.), announced the bill in a Jan. 8 press conference outside the U.S. Capitol. The bill is cosponsored by Reps. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). In addition to MOAA, the bill has the support of the National Guard Association of the United States, Reserve Organization of America, and Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.

MOAA has advocated for years that the confusing and numerous duty classifications has negatively impacted servicemembers’ abilities to count time for benefits like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and for family access to military health care.

The new bill would create just four duty categories, according to Cisneros’ bill explainer:

Contingency duty. Active service in which the member is involved in contingency operations such as military action or operations; responding to a national emergency or natural disaster; or similar missions. This covers post-deployment activities.

Training and support: Active service that does not involve a contingency operation. This may include required training, administrative assignments, support to reserve units, and members reported missing.

Reserve component: Partial-day duty dedicated to readiness training and support to prepare individuals and units to be ready for future use and mobilization. Includes training periods, flight training, administrative activities, and support activities such as funeral honors support.

Remote assignments: Online learning and individually assigned duties that are completed virtually.

“We owe it to our servicemembers to deliver this much-needed change and ensure they are receiving equitable pay and benefits,” said Cisneros, a Navy veteran and former undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.

Bergman, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general, said the bill would improve readiness and reduce bureaucracy.

The president signed the MOAA-backed Fairness for Servicemembers and Their Families Act into law Dec. 12. The bipartisan legislation passed the House by a voice vote in the spring, then cleared the Senate by unanimous consent in November.

“Bipartisan, commonsense improvements to trusted programs like this make a real difference,” said Jen Goodale, MOAA’s director of Government Relations for veteran and retired affairs. “Protecting the value of these benefits is the core of MOAA advocacy — we thank the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle who made this change possible.""

It links the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) between the reports to the current maximum of $500,000 as a benchmark.

“Our servicemembers put their lives on the line for their country, and we must protect the well-being of their families in the event of a tragedy,” said Rep. Marylin Strickland (D-Wash.), who introduced the House bill, in a press release. “This new law makes it clear that our nation will always stand by our military families.”

Senate supporters included Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who led that chamber’s version of the bill. He said the bill would “help ensure the Veterans Affairs Department can offer competitive life insurance packages that keep pace with the current cost of living.”

SGLI launched in 1965 with a $10,000 coverage maximum. VGLI began nine years later, allowing veterans to convert SGLI to a five-year term policy. It would later become a renewable, premium-based plan.

Maximum coverage levels for both plans have increased over the decades, but not in regular fashion. It rose from $200,000 to $250,000 in 2001 and to $400,000 in 2005, but remained at the level for nearly two decades until a 2023 law boosted the limit to the current $500,000.

Description:

TRICARE Provider Readiness Designation Trainings

The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 required the development of a system where non-DoD (TRICARE) mental health care providers who meet eligibility criteria established by the Secretary of Defense, could receive a mental health Provider Readiness Designation. These providers would then be specifically highlighted in the TRICARE directory as having earned this designation.

As behavioral health providers who work with military service members, we hear the term ‘readiness’ often and may wonder what it means and how it could impact our work with our military clients. Generally speaking, readiness refers to the military’s capability to do its job, whether that’s during training, combat operations, or humanitarian missions. In order to ensure that the military can meet its missions, commanders need to know if their service members are able to deploy or work in an austere environment for an extended period of time.

To receive this designation, providers must demonstrate knowledge related to military culture and evidence-based treatments that have been approved by the Department of Defense for the treatment of mental health issues among members of the Armed Forces. This is demonstrated by completing the package of courses listed on this document which have been developed by the Center for Deployment Psychology and approved by the Government.

The six (6) courses are:

Assessing Military Clients for Trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

This workshop will review a method for screening, assessing, and treatment outcome monitoring of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) centered on the use of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Participants will be introduced to VA/DOD best practices for diagnosing military-related PTSD including screening for trauma-related disorders, obtaining thorough military and trauma histories, conducting a semi-structured diagnostic interview, and using self-report measures to track treatment outcome. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD as well as Other Unspecified Specified Trauma and/or Stressor-Related Disorders are reviewed. Tools for assessing PTSD and common comorbid conditions are discussed including appropriate use of the PCL-5, Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C). Semi-structured clinical interviewing techniques are reviewed as they relate to screening, diagnostic assessment, and tracking treatment outcomes. Unique variables that can impact the assessment and feedback process with a military population are identified.

Ethical Considerations for Working with Military Members and Veterans

Civilian behavioral health providers working with military service members and veterans often face ethical challenges unique to this population. Ethical practice is contingent on effective application of personal and cultural morals, as well as on following professional regulations and expectations. Information about informed consent, boundaries of cultural and clinical competence, disposition-driven diagnoses, multiple relationships, and professional fitness are all presented in the context of work with military-connected clients. Decision-making models are included to address ethical dilemmas, with specific presentation of the role of dual relationships within a clinical framework.

Military Culture: Enhancing Clinical Competence

This training is designed for civilian behavioral health providers who want to develop a better understanding about military culture so they can more effectively engage with Service members in their clinical work. The training presents information about who comprises the armed forces as well as basics about organizational structure, branches of service, core values, military missions and operations, as well as the differences between the active and reserve components.

Addressing Suicide with Military-Connected Patients

This training provides a general overview of suicide prevention with military-connected clients. It begins with a comparison of suicide rates for military and civilian populations. Next, it explores myths about suicide and stigma within the military that can result from those myths. Finally, crisis intervention skills are addressed including a review of the steps for safety planning and lethal means safety counseling. The training ends with a review of suggested resources and next steps for additional learning.

An Overview of Sleep Disorders Common in Military Members

In this training participants will gain an understanding of common sleep disorders and sleep-related problems for military members. The presentation focuses on providing strategies to enhance the ability of mental health providers to assess, refer, and identify evidence-based treatments for the top two sleep disorders in military populations.

The Use of Screening Tools

This is an intermediate training that provides behavioral health providers with a general overview regarding the use of screening tools that are utilized with military populations. It starts with reviewing the benefits of utilizing screening tools and exploring limitations. Next, the training reviews specific screening tools for common mental health problems to review their rationale, interpretation, and how to apply those results to clinical decision making. The training includes multiple case examples to apply information about screening tools, as well as discussions on additional considerations such as liability concerns and data storage. This training focuses on utilizing empirically supported screening tools and how to incorporate those results into clinical decision making that have credible empirical support in the literature (i.e., Barry et al., 2023; Duffy et al., 2023; VA/DoD , 2023, 2024, 2025).

Retired Navy Cmdr. Jack Gillett first trained his eyes on the sky as a boy growing up on the California coast. He’d join his mother, a volunteer with the Aircraft Warning Service during World War II, at observation posts and watch for aircraft all night. He never forgot the thrill of phoning in their sightings.

Gillett spent his spare money on model airplanes. There were plastic ones and wooden ones and then flying models.

“Even in high school, dating took a backseat to model airplanes,” he recalled. “My dad told me he was not surprised when I went into aviation.”

Gillett was enrolled in junior college when Navy recruiters showed up and offered to take students to an airport for a ride in trainer planes. He learned that if he had 60 credit hours and could pass a series of tests, he could begin flight training. It was February 1964.

“I didn’t know a Vietnam War was coming,” he said. “But the Navy did.”

Previously aimless, Gillett had found his passion. And he excelled, pinning on his wings at 21. After 15 months as a flight instructor, he reported to his first A-7 squadron. A year and a half later, he was in Vietnam. He would return twice more.

[GET INVOLVED: Find a MOAA Chapter | MOAA Virtual Chapters]

After 20 years of service that included stints as a housekeeper for the vice president, a personal aid to the Navy’s budget director, among others, he retired and returned home to Bakersfield, Calif., and took over the family’s sand and gravel business. After the business shut down, he learned about a position at a high school as a Navy Junior ROTC (JROTC) program and applied. By then, Gillett had been retired for 20 years and required a special waiver for the job. He stood up the program and ran it for six years.

“I really enjoy working with youth,” he said. “I had a really good rapport with them.”

Four years ago, after moving from California to Colorado, Gillett joined the Pikes Peak Chapter just as it was gearing back up after the pandemic. The role of ROTC coordinator was among several unfilled chapter positions.

“I volunteered right away,” he said.

Gillett has been instrumental in growing the chapter’s support of ROTC and JROTC in the area, expanding the number of sponsored units from five to 18, including adding six in just the past year. They include schools in Colorado Springs, Canyon City, and Pueblo, Colo. The latter hadn’t had an official MOAA sponsor in several years.

Additionally, by working with the chapter scholarship committee, Gillett has arranged the award of 18 $1,000 scholarships to one ROTC unit and each of the 17 JROTC units. He also coordinates the chapter’s annual ROTC/JROTC Recognition Luncheon, during which each JROTC unit receives a $300 stipend to support their operations. The work keeps him busy, he said, and he enjoys it.

When Gillett thinks about his volunteer work, he thinks of his mother watching the sky, teaching him by example the value of service.

Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days.
A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.
Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained.
He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""","Fifteen Defense Health Agency facilities earned top marks from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for how well they prepare patients to leave the hospital, according to an analysis by Becker’s Hospital Review.

The report identified 15 military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating for “Care Transitions” from CMS. The rating reflects how patients judged their discharge planning and follow-up instructions after an inpatient stay — a critical time in the patient care journey, said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA deputy assistant director, medical affairs.

“A five-star CMS rating in care transitions shows our teams exceed national benchmarks during one of the most risk-prone moments in care,” he said, noting that strong care coordination, teamwork, and patient-centered discharge planning led to the CMS recognition.

CMS listed hospital and clinic ratings based on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, asking patients about their experience during a recent inpatient hospital stay. Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days. The survey was completed between October 2023 and September 2024, and data was updated July 16, 2025.

Awarded military hospitals and clinics

The DHA military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating from CMS included:

60th Medical Group, Travis Air Force Base, California

96th Medical Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi

88th Medical Group, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

99th Medical Group, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Moore, Georgia

Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, North Carolina

Brooke Army Medical Center, Joint Base San Antonio–Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

Cordts said the recognition demonstrates the agency’s commitment to operational readiness: “By taking superior care of the patient, the DHA also takes care of the warfighter.”

Measuring patient experience

CMS scored hospitals and clinics through a survey asking patients to rate their health care experience through three key components:

During this hospital stay, staff took my preferences and those of my family or caregiver into account in deciding what my health care needs would be when I left.

When I left the hospital, I clearly understood the purpose for taking each of my medications.

Dr. Kristen Atterbury, DHA chief nursing officer, said those questions showed patients understood what to do after hospitalization — such as how to manage recovery, take medications correctly, and follow instructions — that can reduce complications and avoidable readmissions. “When we do those three things well, we empower patients, improve safety, and build trust,” she said.

Sharing decision-making, clearly communicating responsibilities, and thorough medication education are “cornerstones of a safe and positive patient experience,” while helping relieve the burden of recovering from injury and illness, Atterbury said. “A stressed and distracted service member is not a ready one.”

Aligning with DHA lines of effort

Cordts and Atterbury said the recognition correlates directly with DHA’s priorities of combat support, care reattraction, and enterprise services optimization.

Combat support “helps the force stay ready. A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.

Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained. He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""

Enterprise services optimization “uses what works and spreading it across the whole system,” Atterbury said. “The goal is to take strong steps — such as good discharge checklists and follow-up calls — and use them everywhere. This creates a standardized playbook for excellence, optimizing performance, reducing unwanted variation, and elevating the quality of care across the entire enterprise.”

The award gives DHA the opportunity to share best practices across the MHS, using patient feedback to refine discharge planning, medication counseling, and follow-up coordination — equipping warfighters to stay healthy while continuing recovery at home. This phase of the patient care journey can be vital to stay ready, said Atterbury. “A stable, and well-supported family at home enables a focused, mission-ready force in the field.”

Ultimately, the high marks received from CMS demonstrate DHA’s commitment to mission readiness, said Cordts.

“Excelling at care transitions is a strategic linchpin for the DHA,” he said. “It simultaneously enhances warfighter readiness by ensuring family well-being, attracts patients back to the direct care system, and provides a blueprint for system-wide improvement that is central to enterprise optimization.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9124347/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-13 15:56:38.743107

Through this program, your family is connected with an Autism Services Navigator (ASN) who will be your advocate and guide you through the process of getting ABA therapy covered by TRICARE.

If your child received their autism diagnosis after October 1, 2021, they have been assigned an ASN. If your child was diagnosed before then, or if they have not yet been diagnosed, reach out to your local BlueSprig team, who can provide assistance with understanding your TRICARE benefits or connect you with diagnosis resources in your area.

In addition to your ASN, BlueSprig will also work with you to get started. Our team follows all TRICARE requirements as well as state laws and regulations. We’ll also help you with paperwork for any assessments or approvals your child needs.

We understand that military families may often have to move to a new location. With that in mind, our teams are here to help identify support networks, physicians, and more, while supporting any changes in station that may occur during enrollment.

At Bluesprig, we make coordination of care a priority, so we coordinate with your child’s other service providers for better outcomes.

Your family’s ASN will assist in scheduling meetings between all of your child’s providers. If you do not have an ASN, BlueSprig will work with the providers directly to arrange a meeting to increase interdisciplinary support.

TRICARE and BlueSprig value parent involvement in their child’s services and recognize the impact of parents who are part of the overall treatment team. We will work closely with each child’s family to support that child’s growth while also aligning with TRICARE’s requirements for service delivery and parent participation.

BlueSprig is committed to recognizing and valuing the contributions of the military community within the communities we serve.

The Military, Veterans, and Military Families Employee Resource Group at BlueSprig brings together current and former military personnel, family members of those who have served, and supportive allies.

In 2025 the pharmacy filled more than 187,000 individual prescriptions for service members, retirees, and family members, in addition to supporting clinical operations.

Munson’s outpatient pharmacists work behind the scenes and at the pharmacy counter to ensure medications are safe, effective and appropriate for each patient, helping service members remain healthy and ready to perform their missions.

“Our pharmacists do far more than fill prescriptions,” said Capt. Michael Nguyen, Chief of Munson’s Department of Pharmacy. “They are an essential part of the healthcare team, helping patients understand their medications, preventing harmful drug interactions and working closely with providers to support the best possible outcomes.”

Munson pharmacists also play a critical role in patient safety and readiness by identifying potential medication errors before prescriptions are dispensed, ensuring patients understand how to take their medications correctly, and helping minimize side effects that could impact performance.

“Every prescription represents multiple safety checks,” said Dr. Jason Brozek, an outpatient pharmacist and supervisor at Munson. “Our goal is to make sure patients leave the pharmacy confident about their medications and how they support their health.”

In Munson’s Department of Primary Care, Dr. Marketa Lanier, a clinical pharmacist and part of the primary care team, works directly with patients to manage chronic conditions, optimize medication therapy, and support overall health.

“The most fulfilling part of my job is seeing the positive impact of my work,” said Lanier, who was named the 2024 Defense Health Agency Clinical Pharmacist of the Year. “When a patient comes back and tells me how much better and energetic they feel when their blood sugars are controlled or how a small tool like a medication card has helped them, it reminds me why I love what I do.”

Patients are encouraged to speak with a pharmacist if they have questions about their medications or pharmacy services.

Pharmacy services for TRICARE beneficiaries and readiness support The outpatient pharmacy serves all eligible TRICARE beneficiaries, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Pharmacy services are designed to support continuity of care and safe medication use, whether patients are managing a short-term illness or a long-term condition.

Munson’s pharmacy is open weekdays from 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. All NEW and RENEWAL prescriptions require activation before they may be picked up. Call913-684-6250, Option #2 to activate prescriptions by phone.

On Friday, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall visited Irwin Army Community Hospital at Fort Riley in anticipation of a new agreement expected later this month that will expand healthcare access for veterans in the Flint Hills region.

Senator Marshall has worked for more than a year with local, state, and federal leaders to protect Irwin Army Community Hospital after reports that the Defense Health Agency was considering downgrading the hospital to an acute care clinic, threatening emergency, surgical, and maternity care options in the North Central Flint Hills Region.

During the Building a Healthy Home Front forum, at the Association of the United States Army’s 2025 annual meeting, Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre, Surgeon General of the Army, said, “We’re working with our partners at the Defense Health Agency to effectively support that treatment part of the health, bringing virtual care to remote areas…(and) leveraging technology…and humans to provide care.”

“If we can leverage AI to be that entryway, and then triage, then we can preserve those human touchpoints that need that level of care,” she said.

BRAVE has hosted approximately 60,000 virtual therapy sessions since it was launched three years ago. The program is now available at 84 locations across the U.S., Europe and Indo-Pacific region. DHA plans for BRAVE to be available worldwide by the end of this year.

In a release from DHA, the agency said BRAVE has used teleconferencing to reduce patient wait times and provide confidential access to therapy services. The platform’s team of service providers consists of licensed clinical social workers, psychologists and therapists.

BRAVE is managed by the DHA Virtual Medical Center, which offers several other telehealth tools, including the VMC Virtually Integrated Provider Readiness and Remote Clinic, the MHS Patient Portal and MHS Nurse Advice Line. DHA VMC ensures that members of the Army community receive the best possible care through modernized military medicine.

DHA’s BRAVE virtual services are not to be confused with My Military Health’s SilverCloud, which ended in July of this year. The confidential self-help platform provided advice for managing emotions and stress, but it did not offer formal behavioral health treatment. MHS also announced the sunsetting of MHS Video Connect in July.

Virtual supports like BRAVE are a part of the Army’s holistic approach to prevention, which focuses on building resilience and keeping a healthy home front.

The TRICARE decision and recent revenue update sit against a strong run in the shares, with a 90 day share price return of 76.1% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 189.16%, suggesting momentum has been building despite a weaker 5 year total shareholder return of 30.84%.

If Guardant Health has you rethinking the healthcare theme, this could be a good moment to size up other that are catching investors' attention.

With Guardant Health now trading near US$110 after a sharp run and analysts’ targets clustered around roughly US$120, plus an intrinsic value estimate at a larger discount, the real question is whether there is still a buying opportunity here or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 6.8% Undervalued

The widely followed narrative sets fair value for Guardant Health at about US$118, a touch above the last close near US$110, framing today’s optimism in numbers.

Substantial regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical validation milestones (including Shield's breakthrough device status, NCCN guideline inclusion, and ongoing pilot studies) are paving the way for further guideline adoption, expanded payer coverage, and commercial inflections in Shield/MCED and Reveal volumes, significantly increasing future revenue and earnings visibility.

Want to see how this story translates into the valuation gap? The narrative leans hard on rapid revenue scaling, margin shift and an aggressive future earnings multiple. Curious what combination of growth, profitability and discount rate has to line up for that to hold?

Result: Fair Value of $118.18 (UNDERVALUED)

However, the story could shift quickly if high R&D and cash burn lead to fresh equity raises, or if payer adoption for Shield and other tests underwhelms.

Another View: High Growth, Higher Expectations

Our DCF model presents a different perspective. On this view, Guardant Health at US$110.17 sits about 37.5% below an estimated fair value of roughly US$176.29, which suggests the shares may be undervalued if those long term cash flow assumptions prove accurate.

“It is the highest honor and a profound privilege to be entrusted with the health and well-being of our Nation's warfighters and their families,” said Bass, who was confirmed by the Senate on Jan. 5, 2026. “I am deeply committed to delivering the best health care possible and to continue in service to those who serve.”

As the former medical center director for West Texas VA Health Care System, Veterans Integrated Service Network 17, Bass managed health care services for more than 24,000 veterans, an operating budget of $153 million, and thousands of employees. He brings a decades-long career of overseeing comprehensive health care systems across government, the military, and the public.

During his career, Bass became the CIA’s first nonphysician director of the Office of Medical Services, leading teams of hundreds of physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and clinical psychologists who delivered health care to the agency’s workforce.

As a former director of the White House Medical Unit, he managed medical care to the president, the vice president, and their families. Before his position at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Bass was the senior vice president at GlobalMed, managing virtual patient care programs and telehealth services for agencies including the VA, Department of War, Defense Health Agency, and the White House.

Bass said he will leverage his comprehensive, interagency leadership experience to champion exceptional health care to warfighters and families he will serve.

“I am deeply committed to forging a seamless, world-class healthcare experience that supports our uniformed personnel and their families from their first day of service to their last, and continues to care for them as veterans,” he said. “Our warfighters and families deserve nothing less than the absolute best.”

Bass earned undergraduate degrees in psychology and rehabilitation science from Arkansas Tech University, and a master’s of science in rehabilitation counseling from University of Arkansas.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, an experienced clinician, combat veteran, educator, and health care leader, recently reflected on the pivotal work of the Military Health System in 2025, which delivered visible gains in readiness-focused partnerships, increased productivity, revamped credentialing and privileging process, and early deployments of artificial intelligence tools to give clinicians more time with patients.

On Jan. 20, 2025, Ferrara was appointed as the principal deputy assistant secretary of war for health affairs and immediately stepped in as the acting assistant secretary for health affairs until the official nominee, Keith Bass, was confirmed by the Senate Jan. 5, 2026.

Bass has now assumed duties as the assistant secretary.

Ferrara is a retired U.S. Navy doctor with 25 years on active duty and remains a practicing physician. Prior to rejoining the DOW, he was the Chief Medical Officer at the CIA. He also served as the deputy director for clinical operations for the National Capital Region, the DOW’s largest health care network. He currently serves as an interventional radiologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and is a clinical professor of radiology and radiological sciences at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

In this interview, Ferrara discussed the critical priorities for the MHS, such as upgrading infrastructure, maintaining clinical readiness, and strengthening the pipeline of talented professionals dedicated to delivering the best possible care for warfighters.

Following are edited excerpts from the interview, which can be viewed in its entirety on www.health.mil:

Question: You often talk about the “3 S’s” for the Military Health System: supporting the warfighter, sustaining our skills, and strengthening our chain. What do they mean?

Ferrara: Those principles underpin our mission: support the warfighter. We provide health care to the people who defend our country, and that's what makes us unique as a health care system. There are many great health care systems in America — but there's only one great American health care system that goes to war. Fundamentally, our focus is to support the warfighter.

Sustaining our skills means our learned skills must be maintained. I liken it to how our aviators have to get flight hours or how the trigger-pullers go to the range. For our health care professionals, it's working in our MTFs (military treatment facilities) where we're taking care of patients and keeping sharp. We have to be great because our warfighters deserve our very best.

On strengthening our chain: We stand on the shoulders of many great people, both in the military and in military medicine — so it's on all of us to make sure that we pass along that wisdom. Our MTFs are a giant force-generation platform. We graduate 16,000 medical technologists with a variety of skill sets every single year. If we were a university, we'd be the biggest one. We have graduate medical education programs. We have nursing training programs across our entire enterprise. We are always training people to be able to take that baton from us and continue to be a world-class health care system.

Question: It's been an action-packed year when you look back at 2025. How would you characterize a few of our greatest successes?

Ferrara: First of all, we perform on the big picture with great success, including increasing our partnerships. I think we've done a lot to bring in more patients, higher-complexity patients, which improves our force-generation and our skill-sustainment platforms. We've brought in more Medicare patients, and we’re really happy to be able to take care of them. Similarly, with the Department of Veterans Affairs, we've strengthened our partnership to take care of America’s veterans.

We've made significant efforts to reduce administrative burden and improve quality of life. I'm very sensitive to the burdens we place on those who care for patients, because that's what they love to do. We now have universal privileging, which is a significant breakthrough, as it eliminates low-value administrative work such as renewing privileges or obtaining transfer briefs. If you're good enough to work at one MTF, you can work across the enterprise. It also helps our mission by increasing agility, capacity, and capability by giving us the ability to utilize our personnel where and when we need them.

We rolled out ambient listening, an artificial intelligence-powered tool to help bring humanity back to health care. There’s the burden of how much note writing providers have to do, where people are taking work home. With this new tool, you can have a nice, captured conversation with your patient, talk to them, and really be focused and centered on the patient. Ambient listening rolled out at four sites this fall and we're looking to distribute that across the enterprise in 2026.

Question: Speaking about AI in a broader context, are there other priorities that you've set for the MHS to incorporate that technology?

Ferrara: We’re in a golden moment for medicine in terms of all the technology occurring, and AI is a big element of that. AI can also accelerate personalized medicine with the molecular and genetic techniques that we have. For drug discovery and development, AI can enable better therapies for patients.

Clinicians can use AI to make more rapid diagnoses and more rapid treatments, and technologies to empower and enable those frontline medics and corpsmen to be able to do prolonged field care. We’re leaning into our forward-deployable technology platforms, using tools enabling medics and corpsmen right at the point of injury to begin documenting the service member’s medical record. To support clinical decision-making, technology can provide access immediately to guide care for those service members, so we can maximize survivability in the war fight.

Question: You spent a significant amount of time this year going to the deck plate and visiting MTFs around the world. What are your biggest takeaways from those visits, and have you had the chance to incorporate any of the feedback that you've learned when you've been on the ground?

Ferrara: It's always really energizing and restorative for me to get out to the field and see where the work is done. I try to meet as many staff as I can, whether I'm in the operational unit or at an MTF. One of the things I share with them is why it's so important for me to go to the field. Here at the Pentagon, we’re making a lot of decisions, but we have such a large and complex health care system … sometimes the nature of the information gets heavily filtered by the time it gets to me.

When I go to those places, I can learn what it's like to be there. I don't think people at our MTFs or operational units are a mere row in an Excel spreadsheet. There's a lot more to it than that. These are people who are taking care of patients. It's really helpful for me to hear their stories, and I learn a lot from them. Whether it’s simple or about policy, I come back with a punch list of things to help fix.

Question: Can you talk a little bit about what happened at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center earlier in January 2025, one of your first experiences as acting assistant secretary?

Ferrara: Walter Reed, the President's hospital, experienced facility challenges including flooding. Like many of our facilities, they have aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance. I compliment their staff for moving heaven and earth to ensure they always took care of their patients. I went out there and walked the spaces, and then was able to go right to Congress and say, “here are the infrastructure problems, and we need support.” In the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, they gave us $2 billion specifically because of those efforts. We can apply it to help close some of the gaps at our facilities with the greatest challenges for infrastructure. I think we came out of it really well, and that's where that kind of advocacy on the Hill can be invaluable.

Question: What are some of the biggest resource-related challenges and successes for the MHS right now?

Ferrara: I'm a people-oriented leader — I believe having not only the right number of people but also the right skill types and in the right places — because health care is a very personal craft that we do.

We faced challenges early in the year with our civilian teammates as we sought to preserve many positions, but we were very successful because we were able to show how valuable everyone on our team is.

In the last several months of the fiscal year, we implemented policies and increased revenue collections by about $700 million. That's really exciting, because we can take those resources and we can use them to hire people, work on infrastructure, and focus on things that we need.

The National Defense Authorization Act (Fiscal Year 2026) was passed, and we're getting a top-line increase as a department. I'm looking forward to more financial resources that we can then deploy to improve health care for our warfighters and beneficiaries.

Question: What’s the value of welcoming TRICARE For Life beneficiaries back into certain MTFs for patients and for providers?

Ferrara: First and foremost, we're a military family. The opportunity to welcome our TRICARE For Life patients, our seniors, back into the MTFs where they want to get their care is the right thing to do, because it's bringing people in who want to get care from us. They trust us. They've been with us for most of their life.

It also provides high-quality, outstanding care for patients. They get their medications, imaging, and specialist visits, and they have a great patient experience. It's great for skill sustainment when health care professionals are seeing more complex patients, continuing to hone their skills and keep them sharp.

Question: How do you see strengthening the partnership the MHS has with the Department of Veterans Affairs?

Ferrara: The VA can have more demand than they can supply, and we often have more supply; we have excess supply. It’s a great opportunity to meet both of our missions across the country. Veterans may have more complex medical issues than our young, active duty personnel who are often healthy. It provides a robust clinical mix for us and is culturally aligned. Veterans enjoy receiving care at our MTFs. It provides another source of revenue, and it's good for the taxpayer. It’s a great opportunity and unique in government, where we can have wins across the board.

One example of how this has been successful is in El Paso (William Beaumont Army Medical Center). The VA and the hospital have partnered, referring 12,000 surgical patients a year to us. This can generate high value for our combat readiness mission in neurosurgery, orthopedics, and general surgery.

Question: What message would you like to share with the MHS force?",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/ferrara_qanda.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-12 10:56:37.165942

A federal grand jury has indicted Oklahoma chiropractor and medical supply company owner Mark Loftis, 38, for allegedly orchestrating a $30 million durable medical equipment (DME) fraud involving orthotic braces billed to Medicare, TRICARE and CHAMPVA. Prosecutors say Loftis, through Back Pain Home Supplies LLC — which did business as EZ Medical Supply — paid kickbacks to marketers and telehealth providers for patient referrals and signed orders, then submitted claims for unnecessary or improperly provided braces, resulting in roughly $8 million in payments. Loftis is also accused of misusing more than $133,000 in COVID-19 Provider Relief Fund money for personal expenses and to further the scheme.

Loftis is charged with health care fraud, kickback conspiracy and theft of government funds; if convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years in prison on the conspiracy and kickback count and 10 years on each of the theft of government property counts.

A study in Nature Microbiology links auto-brewery syndrome — a rare condition where patients appear intoxicated without drinking — to gut microbes that ferment carbohydrates into alcohol. Researchers report that certain intestinal organisms can produce enough ethanol to raise blood alcohol levels and cause symptoms including dizziness, confusion and impaired coordination. The work may help clinicians better recognize and diagnose the condition and adds to growing evidence that gut microbiota play a key role in metabolic and neurologic health.

Sign this petition to help retired National Guard members keep affordable health insurance and maintain the benefits they rightfully deserve.","I've proudly served in the Air National Guard for 24 years, dedicating a significant portion of my life to protecting our nation. Throughout this time, I've relied on Tricare Reserve Select for health insurance, benefiting from its discounted rate. At present, I pay $286.66 monthly for family coverage, a manageable amount that allows my family to have access to quality healthcare. However, the prospect of retirement presents me with a financial dilemma. Upon retirement, the cost of maintaining the same level of health insurance coverage skyrockets to nearly $1,600 a month. This sudden and substantial increase is unaffordable for many individuals like myself who wish to retire after decades of service.

National Guard members, like all service members, commit years of their lives to ensure the safety and security of our country. We are expected to be ever-ready, to serve at a moment’s notice, and to make sacrifices that often take us away from our families. While serving, we’re afforded the benefit of discounted healthcare premiums, a much-needed support that acknowledges the unique challenges of military life. However, upon retirement, this benefit is stripped away, leaving many to face overwhelming costs just to maintain the same standards of care.

It's time to recognize the lifelong contributions of National Guard members by ensuring they can maintain access to affordable healthcare upon retirement. The sudden spike in health insurance premiums is not only unfair but incompatible with the nature of our service. Our service doesn't end the day we retire; many of us carry physical, emotional, and professional ties to our duty that continue for the rest of our lives.

To that end, we are calling for legislation that allows retired National Guard members to retain their Tricare at the current discounted rates they receive during active service. This change would reflect a fair acknowledgment of the dedication and sacrifices made by those who protect our nation.

Congress and military policymakers have the power to correct this imbalance. By allowing retired National Guard members continued access to discounted Tricare rates, we are honoring their service and ensuring they and their families continue to receive essential healthcare coverage.

We urge lawmakers to act swiftly in addressing this disparity and amending the current policies that penalize our retired service members. With your support, we can bring about meaningful change for those who have greatly served our nation.
