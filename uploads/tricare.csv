It is not age discrimination, you are forgetting that young soldiers are on TLF because they have been declared by SSDI.

I don’t have direct advice for the work around but something that may help you with one, if it helps you get a diagnosis that requires it. Have you been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder? Ever had your genetics pulled for obesity genes? I had the best doc dive down the rate obesity genetics pool, and discovered I had a specific genetic mutation. This diagnosis requires I take glp1 for life, the only other medication that tears it nearly killed me for some reason.

TFL is not just for the 65+ crowd. I am the spouse of a young retiree and I am on TFL because I am disabled and get SSDI and Medicare. I am in my late 40s. I was able to get approved for Mounjaro based on a history of high A1C even though the high numbers were the side effect of being on steroids.

It is actually extremely common for retiree benefits to be reduced as a cost cutting measure because their budget line is usually smaller. The corporate world does it all the time. Especially with government health insurance, they have to keep within the allotted budget so all those bureaucrats can get their usual kickbacks. With all the people who have gone on GLP-1s, I am sure prescription costs have skyrocketed so far this year.",,N,0.0,2025-08-10 11:56:06.366230

CALL TO ACTION: Help a Warrior, Father, and Advocate Get Life-Saving Care

SFC David Hong has spent his entire adult life serving others—on the battlefield, at home, and in the veteran community. Now, he needs our help.

David was born in Brazil, immigrated to the U.S. in 1983, and proudly joined the U.S. Army in 2009 as a Religious Affairs Specialist (56M). He deployed to Korea and Afghanistan, and beyond his military service, he’s a devoted husband and father of three, including a child with special needs who inspired his advocacy for military families facing similar challenges.

In July 2022, during a routine colonoscopy, David’s life changed forever—he was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.

Since then, he’s fought like hell through multiple surgeries, 24 rounds of chemotherapy, and now, the cancer has returned to his liver. His providers gave him 2-5 years to live—but they underestimated David’s will to fight.

David was offered a chance: A cutting-edge, FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment called histotripsy—which destroys tumors in the liver using sound waves, with minimal risk and quick recovery. The procedure is 85-95% effective and could give David a chance at more time with his family and to continue serving others.

But here’s the kicker: TRICARE denied the procedure for a third time yesterday, even against his doctors’ recommendations (see denial in comments).

At HunterSeven, we fight for our warriors, and we were stunned to see how much advocacy had already been done on David’s behalf—to no avail. So we’ve decided: we’re just going to get it done.

We need to raise $45,000 to fund this life-saving procedure.

No red tape. No delays. Just action.

Please help us give David the fighting chance he’s earned.

""I was hearing about it from the providers that of all the payers, Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, the VA (Veterans Administration) TRICARE (coverage for the military and military dependents), the worst payer is Medicare Advantage,"" he said.
They said Medicare Advantage ""stretches out the payment time, is the hardest to deal with, and that surprises me,"" Kaine said.
A member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kaine plans to ask colleagues to look at reforming Medicare Advantage.
The sharpest political question came from 10-year-old Catherine, who told Kaine she wants to be president when she grows up.","After wrapping up a six-day swing through the state at a roundtable with kids at a Richmond YMCA day camp, Sen. Tim Kaine said Friday that his road trip brought unexpected bad news: yet another federally funded health insurance program that's stinting Virginians.

This one is Medicare Advantage, the managed care plans for older Americans.

Kaine said it was distressing to learn of problems with Medicare Advantage in the wake of cuts to Medicaid, the coverage that mainly covers children in low-income families and people with disabilities, along with the end of the enhanced tax credits that make Obamacare coverage affordable for hundreds of thousands of Virginians.

""I was hearing about it from the providers that of all the payers, Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, the VA (Veterans Administration) TRICARE (coverage for the military and military dependents), the worst payer is Medicare Advantage,"" he said.

They said Medicare Advantage ""stretches out the payment time, is the hardest to deal with, and that surprises me,"" Kaine said.

""For some of the individuals, they also are submitting claims and getting it turned down and having to submit them again or taking a long time to get a preauthorization, to see a specialist ... you've got to get a preauthorization,"" he said.

A member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kaine plans to ask colleagues to look at reforming Medicare Advantage.

Virginians' experiences - in this case, the arrests by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Charlottesville - have already sparked legislation. He and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., are sponsoring a bill that would bar federal agents from hiding their faces and require them to display names and their agency when enforcing immigration law.

""You know, having tried a lot of cases in courthouses, I know who are in courthouses, people who are pretty emotional. They're often there for tough, challenging circumstances,"" he said, speaking after the session with the campers at the Northside Family YMCA.

""When I read about the Charlottesville situation, I felt people coming in, not identified as law enforcement with masks, trying to grab people, not only is it going to wreak havoc on the people who are there, who are already in emotional situations, but ... not knowing who they were, you could see something bad happen,"" he said.

YMCA campers

At the roundtable with the YMCA campers - ""I think they were the youngest I've met with yet,"" - Kaine earned a ""wow"" from the 8- to 10-year-olds when he said he's the first Richmonder to serve in the U.S. Senate since the 1830s.

He fielded questions about his office, his first job - as a 13-year-old camp counselor with the Y in Johnson County, Kansas, with a $25 paycheck at the end of the summer - his birthday and famous people he's met.

He also got the advice that Congress needs to do something to get kids more snacks.

Kaine told the campers he was most proud of a bill he and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, joined forces on to raise the minimum age for buying cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21.

""The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) said that bill saved 350,000 lives,"" he said.

The sharpest political question came from 10-year-old Catherine, who told Kaine she wants to be president when she grows up.

The question: ""Do you get to make the rules?""

Well, he said, there's convincing 50 other senators, sometimes 59 others, getting a majority in the House of Representatives and then convincing a president to sign the bill into law.

""You have to really work to persuade people,"" he said.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-09 04:56:08.269465

Why egg freezing may still make sense, even without coverage Military life is unpredictable.
For many women in the military, freezing eggs can be a way to create flexibility down the line.
Bottom line According to TRICARE, egg freezing for non-medical reasons is not covered under standard benefits.
Programs like Cofertility’s Split offer a path to free egg freezing when you donate half your eggs to another family.","If you’re an active-duty service member or spouse and thinking about freezing your eggs, you’re not alone. Many women in the military are interested in preserving their fertility, especially given the demanding nature of military life. Between deployments, relocations, and irregular schedules, starting a family may not be a priority right now—but that doesn’t mean you want to close that door entirely.

In this article, we’ll walk through how egg freezing works for military personnel, what TRICARE does and doesn’t cover, which military hospitals offer reproductive services, and how egg sharing programs like Cofertility’s can help bridge the gap if you're looking to freeze your eggs for personal (non-medical) reasons. We’ll also get into what to expect logistically, how to time your cycle, and what options exist if you don’t qualify for military benefits.

What TRICARE covers—and what it doesn’t

Let’s start with the basics. According to TRICARE, the health plan for active-duty service members, retirees, and their families, elective egg freezing is not covered under standard military insurance benefits. That means if you’re freezing your eggs for non-medical reasons—like delaying parenthood, focusing on your career, or preserving your options—you’ll have to pay for it out of pocket. This includes all parts of the process: medications, monitoring, the egg retrieval procedure, and long-term storage.

TRICARE does cover fertility preservation (including egg retrieval and storage) if your fertility has been impaired by a serious or severe illness or injury related to your service. This includes things like combat injuries that affect your reproductive organs or chemotherapy received during active duty. In these cases, coverage is provided through the Supplemental Health Care Program, which falls under a different category of military healthcare and applies to both male and female service members.

To qualify under this medical exception, you must:

Be an active-duty service member

Have a Category II or III illness or injury sustained during active duty

Be unable to conceive or carry a pregnancy without assisted reproductive technology (ART)

If you meet those criteria, TRICARE will cover services like egg retrieval, sperm retrieval, IVF, and intrauterine insemination. And according to TRICARE, if you paid out of pocket for any of these services after March 8, 2024, you may be eligible for reimbursement.

Where you can get fertility care in the military system

Even though TRICARE doesn’t generally cover elective egg freezing, some military hospitals do offer ART services at a significantly reduced cost. These services are available to eligible service members and beneficiaries on a first-come, first-served basis, depending on availability.

As of now, eight military hospitals offer reproductive endocrinology and infertility care through their graduate medical education programs:

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Bethesda, MD)

Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, HI)

Womack Army Medical Center (Fort Liberty, NC)

Madigan Army Medical Center (Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA)

Brooke Army Medical Center (Fort Sam Houston, TX)

Naval Medical Center San Diego (San Diego, CA)

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (Portsmouth, VA)

Wright-Patterson Medical Center / 88th Medical Group (Greene County, OH)

While these programs prioritize care for service members with qualifying medical conditions, some do accept elective patients on a limited basis. Costs are often significantly lower than in the civilian market, but availability is highly variable, and waitlists are common.

Why egg freezing may still make sense, even without coverage

Military life is unpredictable. You might be deployed overseas with short notice, move across the country every few years, or find yourself in leadership roles that demand your full attention. Fertility doesn’t hit pause while you or your spouse serves—and unfortunately, egg quality declines with age regardless of your fitness level or overall health.

For many women in the military, freezing eggs can be a way to create flexibility down the line. It gives you more reproductive options, especially if you’re not ready (or able) to start a family during your service years. Even if you don’t end up using those eggs, having them stored offers a sense of security.

How Cofertility’s Split program fits in

If you’re interested in egg freezing but can’t afford the costs out of pocket—and don’t qualify for ART coverage through TRICARE—Cofertility’s Split program may be a great option. Through this program, you can freeze your eggs for free if you qualify and donate half of the eggs retrieved during your cycle to a family who needs them.

Here’s what’s covered through Split:

All fertility clinic fees

Medications and monitoring

Egg retrieval procedure

Storage for your half of the eggs for up to 10 years

In exchange, the other half of your eggs are donated to intended parents who are ready to grow their family. You’ll never be asked to pay for anything out of pocket, and you’ll receive personalized support from our team throughout the process.

Eligibility and what to expect

Unfortunately, not everyone will be eligible for Split. Like all egg donation programs, Cofertility requires certain medical and personal criteria, including:

Age 21–33

No smoking or significant reproductive health issues

Willingness to undergo genetic testing and psychological screening

Ability to provide a biological family medical history

If you were adopted or donor-conceived and don’t have access to your biological family’s health history, that may affect your eligibility. If that’s the case, you might consider freezing your eggs through our Keep program, where you keep 100% of your eggs and pay out of pocket, but get access to discounts and dedicated support.

How to time your cycle around military life

Timing is one of the biggest concerns for active-duty service members. An egg freezing cycle typically takes about two weeks of daily hormone injections, during which you’ll need to visit the clinic several times for bloodwork and ultrasounds. Then comes the egg retrieval itself, which is a minor surgical procedure with a short recovery time.

If you’re on active duty, here are a few ways to make it work:

Plan around a block of leave or light-duty status

Schedule during a stateside posting or training pause

Coordinate with your supervisor for time off (how much you share is up to you)

Stay near one of our partner clinics for the duration of your cycle

We understand that flexibility is limited in the military, but we’ve seen it work when there’s advance planning and support in place.

Privacy and confidentiality

Understandably, many service members want to keep their fertility planning private. With Cofertility, all of your care is coordinated through private clinics—not the military medical system. Your participation in the Split or Keep programs is confidential and never reported to TRICARE or your command.

That said, if you’re requesting leave or modified duty to attend appointments, you may need to give some explanation. Some choose to share openly, while others keep it general and simply say it’s for a medical procedure. Either is completely fine.

What if you’re based overseas?

If you’re currently stationed abroad, your options are more limited. While some countries offer fertility care for military personnel at allied clinics, elective egg freezing is unlikely to be available through TRICARE or DoD channels. In most cases, you’ll need to wait until you're back in the U.S. to start the process—or coordinate a trip home during leave.

Bottom line

According to TRICARE, egg freezing for non-medical reasons is not covered under standard benefits. ART services, including egg retrieval, are only available to service members who sustained a qualifying injury or illness during active duty that impairs fertility. However, eight military hospitals do offer ART services at reduced cost, and may accept elective patients when space allows.

If you don’t meet the medical criteria but still want to freeze your eggs, you’re not out of options. Programs like Cofertility’s Split offer a path to free egg freezing when you donate half your eggs to another family. For many women in the military, this can be a way to take control of their reproductive future without waiting for policy to change.

Military service asks a lot—and family planning often gets pushed to the back burner. But if you’re thinking ahead, egg freezing might help create the space you need to build the life you want, when the time is right. We're here to help you explore that, every step of the way.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63249acdcafd34297596984a/68964cddf6c63ad007cf1987_pexels-matthew-hintz-834554-9845005.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-08 21:56:06.961444

Schools require up-to-date vaccines to protect all students from serious diseases. Check your school district’s immunization requirements before the school year starts.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate vaccine doses for children, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook. You can get these vaccines from:

Any TRICARE-authorized provider

Many participating retail network pharmacies

Military pharmacies

Keep your child’s immunization records in a safe place. Schools will ask for proof of vaccines before your child can attend classes.

Vision

Children need clear vision to succeed in school. TRICARE covers eye exams, but the frequency depends on your family’s status. TRICARE covers:

Annual eye exams for children of active duty service members

One eye exam every two years for children of retired service members with TRICARE Prime

Schedule your child’s eye exam before school starts. This gives you time to get glasses or address any vision problems.

If you have vision coverage through Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program or another health plan, be sure to check your plan’s coverage policy.

Dental care for children

Good dental health helps children focus on learning instead of being distracted by tooth pain.

You may qualify for dental coverage through the TRICARE Dental Program. If you’re eligible, you can enroll your child at any time during the year.

Other dental options may also be available to your family. Visit TRICARE Dental Care to learn more about dental coverage options.

Supporting your child’s mental health

Some children feel excited about returning to school, while others feel nervous or scared. These feelings are normal, especially when children:

Meet new friends and teachers

Start at a new school

Move to a different grade level

Watch for signs that your child is having trouble adjusting. Many children feel better once they get involved in school activities. However, TRICARE covers mental health services if your child needs extra help during this transition.

Daily healthy choices

You can help your child make healthy choices every day by:

Packing nutritious lunches and snacks

Making sure your child gets enough sleep

Encouraging physical activity

Talking about school safety

These habits help children stay alert and ready to learn throughout the school day.

College students and TRICARE

If your child is heading to college this fall, they can keep TRICARE coverage until their 23rd birthday or until they graduate, whichever comes first, as long as they:

Are a full-time student at an approved institution of higher education

Have a TRICARE sponsor who provides more than 50% of their financial support

You must update your child’s student status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System to maintain their coverage. Health care plan options for college students depend on where they live.

After college, they may qualify to purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage.

Act now

Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare for the school year. Here are some steps to get started:

Check your child’s immunization records

Schedule needed physicals and eye exams

Review your school’s health requirements

Update information in DEERS if needed

Does your child have a prescription (for example, an inhaler) they need to bring to school? Work with a military pharmacy to get the correct prescription labels. Note: The military pharmacy will ask for your child’s DOD ID.

Additional resources

TRICARE offers many programs and resources to help military families. Visit TRICARE or contact your regional contractor for more information about:

The event provides MHS leaders the opportunity to speak with vendors and innovators to discuss the future and how their products may enhance military health care in one place.
Digital tools advance each goal.
Portable headsets let medics rehearse battlefield care wherever they are and in between patient visits.
Advanced simulation works as a “digital health force multiplier,” said Bible, noting that, ultimately, these digital tools ensure the health and safety of the warfighter is in the hands of thoroughly trained medics.","Artificial intelligence and digital simulation tools are transforming how the military trains its future medical workforce. Military doctors, nurses, medics, and U.S. Navy corpsmen can now rehearse battlefield care in the field, trauma bays, or even downrange: repeating each task until it feels natural, all without touching a patient.

U.S. Air Force Maj. Meki Bocage, deputy chief of the Defense Health Agency’s medical modernization and simulation division, summed up the advantages of these tools, saying, “Simulation tools allow the medical workforce to get their sets and reps with realistic simulators and equipment.” She pointed out the newest models, “create live-resuscitation scenarios, and provide immediate, human, realistic responses.”

Many of these simulation products were on display for leaders across the DHA and Military Health System during the Medical Modeling, Simulation, and Pre-Hospital Innovation Expo at the Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, on July 15, 2025. The event brought together more than 20 companies to demonstrate the latest in digital technology.

The event provides MHS leaders the opportunity to speak with vendors and innovators to discuss the future and how their products may enhance military health care in one place. Bocage said, “The expo allows leadership to see what innovative medical modernization and simulation capabilities that are out there and available.”

Real combat trauma leaves no room for hesitation or mistakes, yet most uniformed clinicians do not get needed battlefield injury training daily, usually only treating everyday illnesses between deployments. Simulation offers unlimited training on complex tasks without harming patients or wasting supplies, and in a shorter time frame.

U.S. Army Col. Ryan Bible, deputy assistant director of DHA’s education and training directorate, called the shift “a game changer,” noting, “the ability to get real-world experience based on a significant pool of data …we get years’ worth of trauma experience in a matter of minutes using this technology.” Virtual platforms extend that realism, where loops within the same scenario turn rare battlefield events into routine muscle memory.

New Tools and the 2025 MHS Digital Transformation Strategy

The MHS strategy lists four main lines of effort: modernize military medical infrastructure, develop digital care models, develop a digitally competent medical workforce, and integrate artificial intelligence and data management. Digital tools advance each goal.

Bible said, “There’s a direct line to the digital transformation strategy … it helps ensure that it’s synergistic across the enterprise, from point of injury to definitive care.”

He stressed the importance of “having a provider that benefits from the AI and simulation tools we have … you no longer have the days of a young doctor out there practicing medicine without real-world experience.”

Simulation checks every box, he says. Virtual reality labs modernize the infrastructure. Portable headsets let medics rehearse battlefield care wherever they are and in between patient visits. Data captured from every training repetition feeds dashboards that enhance learning and training scenarios and turn instructors into data scientists. Algorithms fueled by the new data can predict when skills may need to be polished, and enhanced medics can stay ahead of their training.

Global Learning Environment

MHS leaders envision a “dynamic learning environment,” according to the strategy, where medical personnel in a military hospital or clinic, on a ship, or on the battlefield can join the same scenarios or hear identical vitals and receive feedback within seconds.

“We want to create a comprehensive and holistic learning ecosystem that spans from hospital to battlefield,” said U.S. Army Col. Paul Kwon, chief of DHA’s medical modernization and simulation division. “That continuum of care—from point of injury through the definitive roles of care—is essential for supporting a ready medical force.”

Digital simulation does more than entertain; it produces biometric and task data. Kwon explained how gamified modules run on low-bandwidth tablets, so a corpsman on night watch can treat a blast victim, upload results, and receive a custom refresher before dawn. “The flexibility slashes travel costs and lets units train without pulling clinicians from clinics,” said Kwon.

Turning Practice into Readiness

Every digital pulse and airway attempt generates metrics and data, said Jacqueline Haven, DHA Academy lead. “This data can then lead to more specific training interventions that advance your skills development in a way that’s very targeted to your specific needs. The analytics give us targeted, skill-based training interventions. That’s powerful. It’s not just better training—it’s smarter training,” she said.

Military leaders can now see which medics need a certain training refresher and schedule a shorter drill instead of sending them to a week-long course, and predictive dashboards will soon alert leaders before skills may slip.

Simulation also answers a mandate from the National Defense Authorization Act to adopt best practices from civilian trauma centers while lowering costs. “Simulation training … saves costs. It saves resources. It saves time. It can be at the point of need,” said Kwon. The approach cuts live-tissue labs, reduces bio-waste, and avoids ethical concerns.

Scenarios once limited by space or travel budgets now play out anywhere a secure network reaches remote clinics, forward operating bases, and aboard hospital ships.

Advanced simulation works as a “digital health force multiplier,” said Bible, noting that, ultimately, these digital tools ensure the health and safety of the warfighter is in the hands of thoroughly trained medics. “It cuts preventable deaths and gives every trainee as many tries as needed.”

“Simulation training saves time, saves money, and saves lives,” said Kwon. “And most importantly—it ensures the health and safety of our warfighters are in the best hands possible.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9191266/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-08 12:56:16.851137

Coverage of weight loss drugs for active-duty service members, retirees and their families enrolled in other health care plans, such as Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, will depend on a person’s condition and certain criteria, Tricare said.
It wasn’t clear exactly what benchmarks people would need to meet for weight loss drug coverage.
“Otherwise, if you have an approved prior authorization for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid,” Tricare said in the statement.
Likewise, the number of monthly prescriptions for weight loss drugs filled during the same period rose from seven to 816.","Some retired service members and others fighting the battle of the bulge will no longer have the cost of several popular weight loss drugs covered by the military health system, Tricare announced this week.

Starting Aug. 31, Tricare for Life beneficiaries won’t receive coverage for Zepbound, Wegovy or other GLP-1 medications, a Tricare statement said Tuesday. Tricare is the federal health care program for active-duty service members, retirees and their families.

The change also applies to Defense Department civilians and other people not covered by Tricare but who are eligible to receive care at military hospitals, according to the statement.

Coverage of weight loss drugs for active-duty service members, retirees and their families enrolled in other health care plans, such as Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, will depend on a person’s condition and certain criteria, Tricare said.

It wasn’t clear exactly what benchmarks people would need to meet for weight loss drug coverage. Enrollment in a Tricare premium plan, prior authorization and a prescription from a network health care provider are among the requirements, according to the statement.

“Otherwise, if you have an approved prior authorization for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid,” Tricare said in the statement. “You’ll need to see your provider to discuss your options.”

People affected by the change will get a notice in the mail in the coming weeks, Tricare added.

Use of GLP-1 medications, such as Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro or Victoza, to treat type-2 diabetes still will be covered provided that the treatment is medically necessary and prior authorization is obtained. Some drugs, such as Ozempic, require a copayment.

It’s unclear how many people will be affected by the change. But a Military Health System report published in January 2024 found that the number of active-duty service members who were prescribed a weight loss drug from January 2018 through June 2023 increased nearly a hundredfold, from 1.2 to 104.4 per 100,000 service members.

Likewise, the number of monthly prescriptions for weight loss drugs filled during the same period rose from seven to 816. Nearly 100% of those prescriptions were for a supply of 90 days or less, according to the report.

The report also said that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in 2022 that increased obesity prevalence in military members costs a potential $1.5 billion annually in obesity-related health care and 658,000 lost workdays.

“The trend in use of weight loss medication in the military should continue to be monitored, as these therapies represent a novel tool to manage obesity in this population,” the military health report stated.

The DHA action comes as civilian health care insurers also grapple with a surge of people seeking the costly drugs amid an obesity epidemic.

In a cost-saving move last month, CVS Caremark stopped covering Zepbound, which is used for chronic weight management in obese or overweight adults, CNN reported July 1.

Zepbound and other weight loss drugs typically used to treat diabetes mimic hormones that regulate hunger and satiety, helping people feel full sooner and eat less, according to a University of Chicago Medicine report in June.

But the cost of those benefits ranges from $700-$800 per month, according to the report.

The researchers also studied the financial impacts if a government health care program, such as Medicare, were to expand its coverage of weight loss drugs for medical treatments beyond diabetes or sleep apnea.

Their projections showed that such an expansion could result in $48 billion in new Medicare spending over 10 years, according to the report.

“Insurers and policymakers aren’t just asking, ‘Is this a good treatment?’” David Kim, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said in the report. “They’re asking, ‘What will this do to our budget?’ And for now, the budget impact is huge.”",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/15pb85-110825drugsphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/110825DRUGSphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-08 12:56:28.597132

Dr. Ajay Manhapra, Chief of Pain Medicine at Hampton VA Medical Center and a presenter at FAST, introduced a model centered on “trauma narratives.”

By establishing a trauma narrative, patients and providers can co-create a goal-oriented recovery plan focused on achieving a functional “new normal.”

This method is designed to assist patients in making sense of their experiences by mapping a timeline linking physical injuries to behavioral health challenges, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or opioid dependence.

The model also encourages gradual improvements in physical function while managing persistent pain and limited-time medication rather than striving for a return to a completely pain-free state.",https://thedefensepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/9197727-1024x682.jpg,N,1.0,2025-08-08 12:56:32.589673

Carnegie, Samantha Hawkins",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/healthcare/1663386/federal-court-blocks-arkansas-pbm-ownership-law-citing-constitutional-violations,"""Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth,"" Judge Miller wrote.
These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state's stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.
Judge Miller found that Act 624 does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Takings Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause.
He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.
If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence.","In a significant legal development, a federal judge has temporarily blocked Arkansas from enforcingAct624. Act624 prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in the state, effectively forcing vertically integrated companies to divest or shut down their Arkansas pharmacy operations. However, on July 28, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted a preliminary injunction to several major PBMs and affiliated entities, halting the law's implementation pending final resolution of the case.

Court Finds Violation of Commerce Clause and TRICARE Preemption

In hisorder, Judge Miller concluded that Act 624 likely violates the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause by overtly discriminating against out-of-state companies and imposes an excessive burden on interstate commerce. The statute's preamble explicitly states its purpose is to eliminate ""business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,"" which the court interpreted as protectionist rhetoric targeting non-Arkansas entities.

""Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth,"" Judge Miller wrote. ""The statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect 'locally operated pharmacies' as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out-of-state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.""

The judge emphasized that Arkansas already has several laws regulating PBMs, including statutes that prohibit discriminatory reimbursement practices and exclusion of willing pharmacies from health networks. These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state's stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.

In addition to the Commerce Clause violation, the court found that Act 624 is likely preempted by TRICARE, the federal health benefits program for military personnel and retirees. The law would interfere with the U.S. Department of Defense's ability to contract with PBM-owned pharmacies, undermining the uniformity and stability of the TRICARE network.

""Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act624 license requirements would give the State's pharmacy board a virtual power of review over . . . who the Department of Defense can contract with,"" and "". . . impede[] the TRICARE program's ability to accomplish the purposes for which Congress enacted it,"" Judge Miller wrote..

Broader Constitutional Claims Rejected

While the court granted the injunction based on the Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption, it rejected the plaintiffs' other constitutional claims. Judge Miller found that Act 624 does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Takings Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause. He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.

Furthermore, the court dismissed the argument that Act 624 constitutes a bill of attainder, concluding that the law does not specifically target the plaintiffs and does not impose punishment in a constitutional sense. ""While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,"" Judge Miller wrote.

Irreparable Harm and Public Interest Support Injunction

As outlined in ourJune 2025 blog post, the plaintiff PBMs and other organizations argued that Act 624 would disrupt access to medications for tens of thousands of Arkansans, including TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and patients with complex conditions. The court found that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the law were allowed to take effect, citing the threat of unrecoverable economic losses and the inability to seek damages due to the government's sovereign immunity. The balance of equities and public interest also favored the plaintiffs, as ""no harm is caused when defendants are enjoined from enforcing an unconstitutional law.""

Next Steps and Broader Implications

The legal battle over Act624 is far from over. On July 31, 2025, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed a notice of appeal. The litigation, now consolidated under Express Scripts Inc. et al. v. Richmond et al., Case No. 4:25-cv-00520, will continue in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

The case is being closely watched nationwide, as Arkansas is the first state to enact such a sweeping restriction on PBMs' ownership of pharmacies. If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence. Conversely, a final ruling against the law could reinforce federal protections for PBMs and affiliated pharmacies.

For now, the preliminary injunction preserves the status quo, allowing PBM-affiliated pharmacies to continue operating in Arkansas while the legal battle unfolds.

This process can seem daunting, but a systematic approach makes it much more manageable.

Step 1: Use the Official TRICARE Provider Directory

Your first and best resource is the official provider directory for your TRICARE region. This ensures the doctors you find are in the TRICARE network, which will save you significant money and paperwork.

TRICARE East Region: Use the Humana Military Provider Finder.

TRICARE West Region: Use the Health Net Federal Services Provider Directory.

You can filter by specialty (e.g., Pediatrics, Family Medicine), location, and other factors to generate a list of potential doctors.

Step 2: Getting Referrals (TRICARE Prime)

If you are enrolled in TRICARE Prime, you will need a referral from your assigned Primary Care Manager (PCM) before you can see most specialists.

The Process: Once you have a new PCM, you will make an appointment with them to discuss your need for specialty care (e.g., for an allergist, dermatologist, etc.). Your PCM will then submit a referral request to TRICARE.

Check the Status: You can check the status of your referral on your regional contractor's website. Once approved, you will be authorized to see a specific specialist or choose from a list of approved specialists.

Step 3: Finding a Dentist

Dental care is separate from your main TRICARE health plan. Most active-duty families are covered by the TRICARE Dental Program, which is administered by United Concordia.

,,2025-08-07 23:12:31+00:00,MedCity News,Will the Arkansas PBM Law Survive A Judge's Rejection? - MedCity News,"Marissa Plescia, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://medcitynews.com/2025/08/arkansas-pbm-law-lawsuit/,"Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller blocked an Arkansas law (Act 624) that would have banned PBMs from owning and operating pharmacies in the state.
“Act 624 is explicitly preempted by TRICARE’s ‘health care delivery’ provision because Act 624 prohibits PBM-owned pharmacies from delivering healthcare to Arkansas patients.
The judge also wrote that the plaintiffs would “suffer irreparable harm” from the Arkansas law, including great financial consequences.
“I think when the law was passed, it was by far, one of the most radical PBM state bills out there,” she said.
The National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), meanwhile, believes Arkansas’ law is going to prevail.","As greater scrutiny envelops the largest pharmacy benefit management companies, one thing is clear: They are not going to give up without a fight.

And in that existential battle, they just notched a major win. Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller blocked an Arkansas law (Act 624) that would have banned PBMs from owning and operating pharmacies in the state.

Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law in April, arguing that PBMs have increasingly bought pharmacies, allowing them to increase drug prices and put competitors out of business.

Shortly after, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and PBM lobbying group Pharmaceutical Care Management Association filed separate lawsuits challenging the law.

Miller issued a preliminary injunction against the law, stating that it violates the Commerce Clause, which says that states cannot pass laws that unfairly hurt or discriminate against businesses from other states.

In response to the decision, Sanders said in a statement that “Arkansas was the first state to force big drug middlemen called PBMs to stop inflating drug prices and manipulating the market. The PBMs sued Arkansas and a judge let them get away with it. But we’ll appeal, win in higher court, and set a new standard for the country.”

While the state plans to appeal, at least one healthcare expert isn’t so sure that this law has a future.

“I could be wrong, but I don’t think, as it is drafted today, that there’s any possibility that it gets around the constitutional challenges that it faces,” said Chris Deacon, principal and founder of VerSan Consulting.

That said, Arkansas’ efforts still sent a powerful message.

“If anything, what I think this does is it very clearly sends a signal to Congress that the states are trying [and that] this is a problem,” Deacon stated. “They are trying to deal with it head on. ‘We cannot do this alone. … We need Congress to act because the holding is very clear: Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce. The states do not.’”

The judge’s decision

The judge granted the plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction for a few reasons. That includes his conclusion that they are likely to “prevail” on their Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption claims.

The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, while the negative implication of this authority — the dormant Commerce Clause — bars states from discriminating against interstate commerce.

“Act 624 appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,” the judge stated. “This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ ‘business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business.’”

Moreover, the judge found that Act 624 conflicts with the federal TRICARE program, which is a healthcare program for active duty service members. TRICARE includes a preemption clause, meaning it overrides state laws that are inconsistent with TRICARE.

“Act 624 is explicitly preempted by TRICARE’s ‘health care delivery’ provision because Act 624 prohibits PBM-owned pharmacies from delivering healthcare to Arkansas patients. This prohibition is inconsistent with the TRICARE program that has existing contracts with some of the plaintiffs,” Miller said.

The judge also wrote that the plaintiffs would “suffer irreparable harm” from the Arkansas law, including great financial consequences.

CVS previously told MedCity News that it would be forced to close 23 community pharmacies in Arkansas and fire more than 500 local healthcare workers. Express Scripts doesn’t operate brick & mortar pharmacies in Arkansas, but it does have 25 non-resident pharmacy licenses in Arkansas that would be affected by the law.

The ruling was warmly greeted by plaintiffs whose response was framed in the context of how Arkansas’s law would harm patients with no mention of how it harmed their business prospects in the state.

David Whitrap, vice president of external affairs at CVS Health, said the company is “pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624. We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

A representative for Express Scripts echoed this.

“We appreciate the Court acting to protect Arkansans’ access to their pharmacies,” said Andrea Nelson, chief legal officer of The Cigna Group, which owns Express Scripts. “Every day, our nurses, pharmacists and other dedicated team members provide care to Arkansas patients that can’t be easily replaced, and we will continue doing everything we can to protect Arkansas patients’ access to care and affordable medicines.”

What’s ahead?

It will be interesting to see how the battle between a Republican governor of a conservative state and the PBMs plays out if Sanders formally appeals.

Deacon of VerSan Consulting believes there isn’t any hope left for Arkansas’ PBM law, given this decision from the lower court was expected as it’s a “clear violation of the Commerce Clause.” She speculated that whoever reviewed the legality of the law likely knew that it would be challenged. However, passing the law brought great awareness to the issue of PBMs, she said.

“I think when the law was passed, it was by far, one of the most radical PBM state bills out there,” she said. “It was definitely the talk of the town. I think for the state of Arkansas, it really showed that they were ready to move on this and act against some of these big industries’ corporate interests, which made a big statement.”

Not all are swayed by this bleak prospect for the law.

The National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), meanwhile, believes Arkansas’ law is going to prevail.

“I do feel like it was the wrong decision because if you look at the way the law was written, you get away from all of the extraneous information that was brought into the record by the PBMs to sort of place a fog over the overall purpose and meaning of this law. I think reasonable minds will agree that this does not violate the Commerce Clause because there’s not a regulation of out-of-state entities, as the PBMs have claimed,” declared Matthew Seiler, general counsel at the NCPA, in an interview. He noted that it is actually a regulation of the corporate structure of PBMs, “regardless of where they are located.”

Whatever the legal future of the Arkansas law is, meaningful PBM reform needs to come from a national level instead of a patchwork of states, Deacon said. And currently, PBM reform is at the top of a lot of lawmakers’ minds. Numerous bills have been introduced targeting PBMs, including efforts to delink PBM compensation from list prices and banning spread pricing, in which PBMs charge payers more than they pay the pharmacy for a medication and then keep the difference.

Deacon is particularly in favor of the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act, which goes beyond PBM reform by requiring providers to publish the costs of services so Americans can compare prices. It ensures employer access to claims data and PBM information as well.

Seiler also called out the PBM Reform Act, which would ban spread pricing in Medicaid and delink PBM compensation from the cost of medications under Medicare Part D.

In December, a bill in Congress similar to the Arkansas law was also introduced. It’s called the Patients Before Monopolies Act and would ban the joint ownership of PBMs and pharmacies. However, this bill may be a “bridge too far” from what the federal government can achieve at this point, but it is indicative of where lawmakers want to go in the future, Deacon said.

In the absence of Congressional action, the states will likely continue to try and regulate PBMs. For example, California recently proposed a bill that would delink PBM compensation from the list price of a drug, which Paul Markovich, CEO of Ascendiun, noted in a recent episode of MedCity Debunked. Ascendiun is the nonprofit parent company of Blue Shield of California. He argued that the role of PBMs has absolutely nothing to do with the price of the drug.

“It’s not as if Amazon charges you for the cost of the contents of the box,” he said.

But Deacon hopes that with states stepping up, that Congress won’t slow its roll.

“What I would hate to see is Congress lose their energy and impetus to do something on a federal level [thinking] the states have this,” she said. “That would be a real lost opportunity.”

She added that states likely aren’t cracking down on PBMs because they simply want to, but because they’ve become a serious problem. Most states would probably be in favor of federal action against PBMs.
