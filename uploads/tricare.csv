— Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services

PENSACOLA , FL, UNITED STATES, April 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and Prizm Medical Inc., a leading provider of electrotherapy devices, announced today that they have partnered to serve federal healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Lovell Government Services will serve as Prizm Medical Inc.’s Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor to serve these customers through federal contracting systems.

About the Products

• Micro-Z™ Mini and Micro-Z™ II DC Stimulators are the world’s first and only wearable medical devices that offers below-sensory nocturnal HVPG stimulation while you sleep for rapid recovery and unlimited drug-free pain relief – all with the convenience of a portable delivery system for in-home treatments. Micro-Z™ Mini includes a built-in EMR for increased patient compliance.

• Intelligent Textiles®, the world’s first garment electrodes are conductive garments that provide an unparalleled delivery system for uniform stimulation treatments across large areas of the body. These include Silver-Thera™ socks, stockings, leggings, gloves, sleeves, braces, wraps, and more.

• Thera-Cream™ Electrotherapy Skin Prep is a highly conductive cream that increases skin conductivity for superior electrotherapy treatments with Intelligent Textiles®. This popular item is being used in some hospitals as a replacement for ultrasound gels because it is not sticky, it absorbs into the skin with no messy cleanup, it has an aroma that is enjoyed by men and women, and it therapeutically heals dry, cracked skin.

FDA Indications

• Pain Relief

• Increases Microcirculation

• Increase Range of Motion

• Retard Disuse Atrophy

Medicare Approved for:

• Acute Post-Op Pain Relief

• Chronic Pain Relief

• Retard Disuse Atrophy (Reimbursed by most private insurance)

Evidence Based Medicine

• 50 years of clinical research with 109 studies on HVPG

• 4 published research on The Silver-Thera Stocking

• Medicare approved procedure codes for wound healing

• U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend for wound healing

As Prizm Medical Inc.’s SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. Prizm Medical Inc. is available on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency’s Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). Listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

""We’re excited to partner with Prizm Medical Inc., a leader in electrotherapy innovation. Their Micro-Z™ DC stimulator, already benefiting over 300,000 patients worldwide, offers a unique, effective solution for healing and pain relief. This collaboration will bring accessible, advanced treatment options to those in need.” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

“Pain is a messenger. You can shoot the messenger with a drug, or you can respond to the message by promoting healing at the source of the pain. Since the human body operates on DC signaling, Micro-Z™ technology stimulates healing at the source of the pain instead of masking it like traditional TENS electrotherapy. To compare the two, TENS therapy delivers a low frequency AC current in Milliamps, resulting in shallow, temporary pain relief, and only while being worn. Micro-Z™ technology delivers a high volt pulsed DC current in Microamps, resulting in deep tissue microcirculation at the cellular level, promoting healing and pain relief at the point of origin. The consistent results from hospitals using Micro-Z™ technology are improved medical outcomes, reduction in costs, and increased revenues.” - James Johnson | Founder & CEO, Prizm Medical Inc.

About Prizm Medical Inc.

Prizm Medical is a 28-year-old company, and the premier developer and manufacturer of electrotherapy devices and Intelligent Textiles® for Medicine. As the developer of the world’s first garment electrodes, the company has been in the forefront of research and development addressing diabetic foot disease for over a decade.

Key Takeaways

The expansion of Amwell's platform in the Military Health System is expected to boost subscription revenue and enhance margins significantly.

Divesting Amwell Psychiatric Care strengthens the balance sheet, allowing focus on higher-margin core services and improved net margins.

Flat revenue growth, declining visit volumes, and client attrition highlight challenges in sustaining revenue; reliance on military contracts and cost cuts may risk future growth.

Catalysts

About American Well

An enterprise platform and software company, delivers digitally enabling hybrid care in the United States and internationally.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

The staged launch and expansion of Amwell's platform across the Military Health System, their most significant growth initiative, is expected to significantly increase subscription revenue, with the full deployment anticipated to be completed this year. This will likely lead to increased revenues and margins as well as a higher quality revenue mix due to the size and strategic importance of such contracts.

Amwell aims to achieve positive cash flow by 2026 through increasing subscription software revenues and aligning costs, expecting a meaningful margin expansion with an over 60% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the coming year, impacting their net margins and earnings positively.

The divestiture of Amwell Psychiatric Care, which was not integral to the company's core offering, has bolstered Amwell's balance sheet by adding $30 million in cash and allowed them to focus on higher margin core subscription services, likely leading to improved net margins and operating income.

Amwell is focused on expanding its existing contracts and signing new ones, notably in the government sector, with significant opportunities in the pipeline. Successful execution could considerably enhance their revenue growth and subscription revenue mix.

Increasing the mix of recurring subscription revenue, partly through strategic partnerships like the one with Vida Health, is expected to not only drive revenue growth but also improve earnings visibility, predictability, and profitability by enhancing the quality of revenue and expanding profit margins.

American Well Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

Analysts are assuming American Well's revenue will grow by 6.0% annually over the next 3 years.

Analysts are not forecasting that American Well will become profitable in next 3 years. To represent the Analyst Price Target as a Future PE Valuation we will estimate American Well's profit margin will increase from -81.8% to the average US Healthcare Services industry of 12.2% in 3 years.

If American Well's profit margin were to converge on the industry average, you could expect earnings to reach $36.8 million (and earnings per share of $2.05) by about April 2028, up from $-208.1 million today.

In order for the above numbers to justify the analysts price target, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 7.1x on those 2028 earnings, up from -0.5x today. This future PE is lower than the current PE for the US Healthcare Services industry at 50.9x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to grow by 5.31% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 7.59%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

American Well Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

Amwell's revenue growth has been stagnant, with Q4 2024 revenue flat compared to the previous year, indicating challenges in driving top-line growth which could impact future earnings.

A significant decline of 18% in visit volumes compared to the previous year suggests potential challenges in maintaining customer engagement and sustaining revenue streams from visit-based services.

The company experienced material attrition among its major clients in 2024, affecting the stability of its revenue base and posing a risk to future revenue continuity.

The dependency on a successful renewal and execution of the Military Health System contract exposes the company to significant risk if there are delays or changes to government funding, which could impact projected revenues.

Cost reduction initiatives, while improving EBITDA, could lead to underinvestment in areas critical for growth and innovation, potentially impacting long-term revenue growth prospects and margins.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The analysts have a consensus price target of $11.643 for American Well based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $15.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $10.0.

In order for you to agree with the analyst's consensus, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $303.2 million, earnings will come to $36.8 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 7.1x, assuming you use a discount rate of 7.6%.

Given the current share price of $6.81, the analyst price target of $11.64 is 41.5% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“It's a great honor to be named as DHA R&D-MRDC Employee of the Year,” says Thakur.
ORA contributes to DHA R&D-MRDC’s multifaceted effort to integrate medical research and development with Warfighter requirements in a unique way.
Its multidisciplinary team of regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals specialize in guiding regulated medical products through the FDA’s rigorous review process.
“He is a tremendous asset to the ORA team.” Thakur joined ORA in 2013 as a contractor and transitioned to civilian status in 2017.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics Branch at the Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command’s Office of Regulated Activities, received the 2024 Employee of the Year award for his exemplary regulatory support for the command’s advanced development programs that contribute to Warfighter survivability, force health protection, and readiness.

In announcing the award, DHA R&D-MRDC Director Maj. Gen. Paula Lodi noted that thanks in large part to his leadership, five medical products attained marketing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year – believed to be a record number for the organization.

Each of the products meets an urgent military medical requirement to provide Warfighters with cutting-edge solutions that ensure greater resilience, adaptability, and lethality. Thakur’s efforts to field these products, therefore, directly contribute to DHA R&D-MRDC’s success in improving combat casualty care and enhancing human performance.

“It's a great honor to be named as DHA R&D-MRDC Employee of the Year,” says Thakur. “It elevates my confidence level and my motivation to continue striving for the levels of performance that we accomplished last year and continue even further.”

Thakur praised the members of the two teams he leads for their scientific and regulatory affairs management excellence in seeing the five products through the regulatory process to completion last year, along with shepherding many other projects that are currently progressing through the regulatory review process.

Four of the products – the i-STAT Traumatic Brain Injury Whole Blood test, the MEQU Portable Blood and IV Fluid Warmer System, the Automated Processing of the Physiological Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity Hemorrhage Risk Index, and the Infrascanner Model 2500 – received FDA clearances, allowing the devices to be marketed in the United States. The fifth product, the Humacyte acellular tissue engineered vessel, received biologics license application approval from the FDA. These milestones represent the culmination of more than 15 years of development activities and ORA regulatory support to the project management offices for those products.

ORA contributes to DHA R&D-MRDC’s multifaceted effort to integrate medical research and development with Warfighter requirements in a unique way. Its multidisciplinary team of regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals specialize in guiding regulated medical products through the FDA’s rigorous review process. By identifying and mitigating risks early in the development life cycle, ORA accelerates the delivery of lifesaving drugs, biologics, medical devices, and combination products to the Warfighter. ORA provides its services to partners across DOD. Thakur’s Medical Devices and Diagnostics branch, one of three regulatory branches in ORA, focuses on expeditionary medicine and treatment, brain health protection, and acute care.

“Chandar has been the solid source of regulatory intelligence who makes sure we're getting the most up-to-date understanding of the FDA's thinking and guidance for specific products,” says Lt. Col. Stuart Hobbs, ORA’s deputy director. “He provides constant and steady guidance to ensure his teams get through the development pathway in the shortest and most cost-effective way. It's great to see that steady effort recognized.”

Lisa Borek, ORA’s director and senior regulatory and clinical services manager, who has worked with Thakur since 2015, says the award is a recognition of his strong and unwavering dedication to helping DHA R&D-MRDC develop life-saving treatments, trauma care solutions, and medical devices that harness cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and human performance optimization.

“When presented with a regulatory obstacle, Chandar views it as a workable challenge,” says Borek. “He has built solid relationships with our FDA partners that serve us well when we need answers to keep a development moving along the regulatory pathway to approval.”

“He cares deeply about the DHA mission and is focused on getting products through the FDA and available to our Service Members,” adds Borek. “He is a tremendous asset to the ORA team.”

Thakur joined ORA in 2013 as a contractor and transitioned to civilian status in 2017. In that time, he’s seen many advances in military medical technologies, but the fundamentals have remained the same; the key, he says, is to stay on top of the latest developments wherever they happen.

“The regulatory environment is always dynamic, always changing,” says Thakur. “It's important to keep up with the current thinking from the FDA.

Early in the year, complaints about the vendor that administers the western region contract for TRICARE, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, surfaced across several segments of public discourse. At the time, Autism Business News found that nearly every system providers needed to use for administrative work with TriWest was nonfunctional.

At nearly the same time, providers who engaged with the eastern TRICARE contractor, Humana Military, began to disclose similar problems.

For months at a time, technology systems did not work as promised, and payments were not made, driving an existential crisis for the providers that often either go out of their way to serve active military members and their families or are based in communities around military bases and installations.

This has left several autism therapy providers — although the problems with TriWest Healthcare Alliance and Humana Military were not limited to autism therapy providers — feeling helpless, frustrated and worried about their organization’s survival and access to care for military families. Autism Business News has spoken to several autism therapy and related providers on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from sharing their experiences.

“It was clear when it went live — and we heard this from all the other groups we know — nothing was ready to go on Jan. 1,” said the clinical director of one Tennessee-based practice.

Fortunately, by mid-March, many of the most critical issues had been resolved by Humana Military and its subcontracted claims processor PGBA, according to several sources. One source posited the situation was about “85% resolved” during an interview.

Providers in several states have told ABN that payments for claims are coming through. Claims processes appear to be working; authorizations are being accepted and assessed. Others say that claims are being paid and processed within a typical 30-day timetable but are not going at an even cadence. Others still complain that the self-service tools are not correctly displaying provider information or allowing providers to track their claims and payments.

Still, in stark contrast to reporting done earlier in the year on the TriWest Healthcare Alliance process, several providers have said that PGBA and Humana Military are communicating with providers to some degree and making demonstrable progress. What’s more, the federal apparatus over TRICARE has taken greater notice as the contract transition crisis has carried on. TRICARE is part of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), a division of the U.S. Department of Defense.

“I received a call last week from a DHA rep working with Humana Military apologizing for the entire fiasco,” one provider in Virginia said. “Overall, things appear to be normalizing, but there are still some unresolved issues.”

Multiple representatives of Humana Military did not respond to requests for comment.

What happened?

The roots of the TRICARE challenges reach back years and years.

DHA announced it had awarded the “new T-5 contracts” to Humana Military, a part of the Louisville, Kentucky-based managed care organization, Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), and TriCare Healthcare Alliance in December 2022. Humana has engaged with the U.S. Department of Defense since 1996, the company said. In 2011, DOD awarded a contract to Humana to administer the now-defunct TRICARE South region. The TRICARE regions were fused to simply include East and West for the 2016 contract awards; Humana won the contract for the East region in 2016.

Along the way, Humana Military has engaged with various subcontractors to handle the technical aspects of billing and claims processing. One contractor included PGBA, a part of the team of contractors that Humana included in its pitch for the TRICARE contract. PGBA replaced Wisconsin Physicians Service (WPS) as Humana’s claims processor. However, PGBA has been a partner for Humana in its previous TRICARE contract awards. Based on providers’ observations, one key hiccup was that the claim system could not reconcile claims and provider profile data for operators and organizations in the PGBA system before the current contract period.

Additionally, there were hangups in getting digital claims submission and payment processing correct. One subject matter expert told ABN that Humana Military offered payment advances on pending claims. While seen as a good faith effort, this person said, it has led to another point of irritation with providers.

“It’s just that people are really mad because as soon as claims started to process, [Humana] started to reconcile [payments with the advance],” this person said. “They went weeks without getting paid and [Humana] is taking back claim dollars from literally the first things that are going through. So, they’re still not getting paid even though they’re getting processed.”

The situation may distress some autism therapy providers beyond the crisis of the last few months. Organizations across all regions of TRICARE note that care rates, even if a smaller portion of a provider’s revenue, aren’t at the levels that lead to padded balance sheets. Meaning, some organizations may stop working with TRICARE patients or face the likelihood of being forced to shut down.

The biggest concern among providers

All sources consulted for this story worry that the TRICARE contract transition snafu will limit access to services for the program’s members. A near second to that, they worry about the prospect that autism therapy providers may shut altogether, further complicating the access challenges for the industry.

Earlier in the year, some providers in the East region said their business demise was a distinct possibility.

“If I have to give my clients a heads up and tell them I have to shutter, I can’t continue, then they’re going to have to go back to waiting lists, and that can be six months and up to a year just to get another therapist in the door for them,” one provider said in February.

Others also worry that fewer autism therapy providers will lead to limited job prospects in regions with large TRICARE populations. With fewer organizations in those communities, there are fewer job opportunities. And with the cash flow crunch created by the flubbed contract transition, organizations that will weather the storm won’t have the resources to hire staff hitting the market due to closures. That assumes that clinicians will want to come back or come to the TRICARE slice of the autism therapy industry at all.

“So, now we have all these kids — my phone is ringing off the hook and they’re asking, ‘Do you have any openings?’ And I don’t, and I won’t, not because I don’t want to, but also because we’ve been trying to hire,” one provider said. “Who wants to come work within this program right now?”",https://bhbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/04/ryan-quintal-SqrXDNo584Y-unsplash.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-04-04 14:56:26.430667

Among the many professionals dedicated to this mission, Lt. Donte Brackett, the hospital’s dietitian – and U.S. Navy Dietitian of the Year – plays a crucial role in shaping warfighter readiness and ensuring patient safety through education.

“Food science is fascinating, especially in how it varies based on factors like age and health conditions,” Brackett said. “I love educating and empowering people to make informed choices, and I enjoy collaborating with healthcare professionals. The opportunity for community outreach and advocating for better nutrition policies also motivates me. Being a dietitian is a fulfilling way to make a positive impact.”

Dietitians are more than advisors on food choices, they help sustain the health and performance of service members in a demanding operational environment.

“Understanding hydration, sodium, electrolytes, exercise and how to fuel your body based on climate, location and type of work matters,” Brackett said. “Consider the caloric needs for different environments or different jobs. [Masters-at-Arms] may be more active and outdoors, whereas a corpsman may be indoors doing patient intake with less movement. Their dietary needs are different.”

For patients recovering from injuries, illnesses, or surgery, a dietitian’s recommendations can directly impact healing and recovery times, including food-drug interactions and food safety considerations.

Brackett joined the Navy as an undesignated enlisted Sailor and found his calling as a hospital corpsman. He became a surgical technician, serving in that rate for 10 years. A conversation with a surgeon changed his trajectory.

“I liked medicine, I loved healthcare and helping people, but I didn’t want to be a nurse or a doctor,” Brackett said. “The surgeon mentioned that a lot of the surgeries he performed could have been prevented with diet intervention – that got my attention.”

That conversation sent Brackett “down the rabbit hole” of researching dietetics and speaking with military dieticians.

“I wanted to become a dietitian because of my passion for nutrition and its significant impact on health. Witnessing how dietary choices can transform lives inspired me to help others achieve their health goals. I find it very rewarding when I see patients make the connection between nutrition and health,” Brackett said. “I love this job.”

Brackett later commissioned as a naval officer and found his calling as a lifestyle dietitian. He now sees a wide variety of patients, helping them make sustainable dietary and lifestyle changes to improve their overall health and well-being using a holistic approach.

“GTMO is unique, I’m the only dietitian on the base and I see everyone – active-duty members, dependents, foreign nationals, Special Category Residents – every case from pregnancy to geriatrics – you just need a referral,” Brackett said. “If you just want some nutrition information, I can help. Whether it’s weight loss, food allergies, disease management, or caloric increase, dietitians are like Swiss-Army knives, we have a broad range of knowledge about nutrition.”

One of the biggest topics he educates people about is portion control.

“Energy in, energy out. A lot of people go zero to 100 when it comes to weight loss which becomes a rollercoaster of crash dieting,” Brackett said. “I recommend starting small, write down what you eat and your activities for three days, then we analyze it together.”

Brackett also helps patients focus on incremental improvements, like reducing caffeine or sugar consumption. He uses this strategy to help patients analyze and understand why they met – or missed – the goal.

“Food is both a gift and challenge. We use it for celebration, but we also find ourselves reaching for food when we want comfort,” he said. “Mindfulness matters, be in control of your emotions when you eat.”

From high-intensity workouts to extended deployments, service members rely on optimal nutrition to sustain energy and recover quickly. Dehydration, poor diet, or nutrient deficiencies can lead to fatigue, decreased focus, and an increased risk of injury.

“My job is a balance of science, strategy and service. Nutrition isn’t just about food—it’s about fuel. My job is to make sure our warfighters get the right nutrients to stay strong, sharp, and mission ready.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8954022/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-04 13:56:27.397663

Secure portal messages allow patients to connect with their health care teams between clinic visits. Older adults, who often have multiple chronic conditions, may particularly benefit from portal messages, given challenges with accessing care and addressing all health issues comprehensively in a single office visit. In 2020, telemedicine reimbursement expanded, allowing clinicians to bill for portal messages that require clinician time for medical decision-making.1,2 However, copays associated with portal messages may discourage patients, especially individuals with low income, from communicating important health information through the portal. Furthermore, coverage for billed portal messages vary by insurance plan. Our objective was to characterize the prevalence of reported copays for portal messages by health insurance type among US adults aged 50 years or older who used portal messaging.

Methods

From February 22 to March 12, 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey using a probability-based sample of US adults aged 50 years or older (43.7% completion rate [eMethods in Supplement 1]) through the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging and weighted the sample to reflect population figures from the US Census Bureau.3 The University of Michigan institutional review board deemed this study exempt and waived informed consent because the data were deidentified. We followed the AAPOR reporting guideline.

Older adults were asked if they had a patient portal, had messaged a health care professional (the term health care provider was used in our survey) through the portal, and whether they were charged a copay for sending a message. Self-reported sociodemographic information and health insurance information were collected. We used multivariable logistic regression with average marginal effects to estimate associations between having been charged a copay for sending a portal message (primary outcome) and health insurance type (main variable; eMethods in Supplement 1). We used sample weights to account for probability-based sampling design and survey nonresponse. Two-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 18.

Results

Of the 3212 respondents (mean age, 65 [95% CI, 64-66] years; weighted, 53.3% women and weighted, 46.7% men), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.1%) of respondents reported having a patient portal and 64.7% (95% CI, 62.3%-67.2%) reported sending a portal message in the past year (Table). Across health insurance types, most older adults reported having sent a portal message in the past year, ranging from 58.6% (95% CI, 44.3%-72.8%) of those with traditional Medicare without supplemental insurance to 75.2% (95% CI, 67.9%-82.5%) of those with Veterans Affairs coverage (Figure). A lower proportion of older adults (13.1% [95% CI, 11.4%-15.0%]) reported being a charged a copay for sending a portal message (Table), with the highest estimate being 16.6% (95% CI, 11.2%-21.9%) for those privately insured, followed by 15.9% (95% CI, 4.5%-27.4%) for those dual-eligible or with Medicaid (Figure).

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of adults aged 50 years or older, most individuals reported sending a portal message to their health care professional in the past year, with a minority reporting ever having a copay for such messages. The low prevalence of copays in our study is consistent with prior studies showing full coverage of portal message out-of-pocket costs among privately insured patients over 80% of the time, with estimates ranging from $14 to $40 per message when not covered.4 We found that Medicaid-eligible individuals had similar estimated prevalences of reported copays compared with privately insured individuals. Although we lack data on self-reported out-of-pocket costs, our findings highlight a potential gap where Medicaid-eligible individuals may not experience the same degree of cost-sharing reduction they typically receive for many other clinical services.5 Limitations include inability to identify nonbillable messages and data being self-reported and subject to possible recall bias, which may underestimate the true prevalence of charged copays.6 Future research should explore how variation in portal message copays across payers, particularly Medicaid, impact health care utilization among individuals with low income.

What You Need to Know: CMA and AMA have filed a joint brief in defense of California’s long-standing Truth in Advertising law that prohibits the use of the title “doctor” in a health care setting by anyone other than licensed physicians.

The California Medical Association (CMA) and the American Medical Association (AMA) have filed a joint amicus curiae brief in Palmer v. Bonta defending California’s long-standing Truth in Advertising law that prohibits the use of the title “doctor” or the prefix “Dr.” in a health care setting by anyone other than California-licensed allopathic (M.D.) or osteopathic (D.O.) physicians.

This case arises from a lawsuit by three nurse practitioners holding “Doctorate of Nursing” degrees who want to refer to themselves as “doctors” when treating patients. Their lawsuit seeks to invalidate California Business and Professions Code section 2054, arguing that the statute violates their First Amendment speech rights. The nurses claim they are not misleading patients because they use “doctor” and the title “Dr.” in conjunction with their nursing degrees. They admit such usage is not permitted under the law in patient-facing settings. Last month, both sides in the case filed motions for summary judgement. (A petition or motion for summary judgment is a request for the judge to decide a case without a full trial, arguing that there are no genuine disputes of material fact.)

CMA and AMA filed a joint brief, in support of the state’s motion for summary judgment, emphasizing that courts have repeatedly found a legitimate government interest in preventing misleading advertising or misrepresentation in health care settings. California’s 88-year-old statutory rule designed to protect Californians who interface with the health care delivery system helps ensure that patients are not misled into thinking a practitioner is a licensed physician when they are not.

Physicians are educated and trained differently and more deeply and robustly than any other professional health care practitioner; and industry practice and the law continue to place physicians at the center of medical care.

“The rigorous requirements for physician education and training aim to not just create practitioners to handle routine issues, but leaders in modern health care who are able to coordinate health care teams and solve complex medical issues, identify critical diagnoses, and render timely treatment decisions,” the brief said.

A misrepresentation of a practitioner’s level of licensing can jeopardize patient safety as a patient may mistakenly believe that the midlevel practitioner possesses the same level of training and qualification as physicians licensed by a California medical board.

Patients have a right to clear, honest information about who is providing their care. Yet in today’s health care settings, it’s becoming harder for patients to distinguish between who is — and who isn’t — a physician.

The Truth in Advertising laws exist to protect patients, helping ensure they aren’t mistakenly led to believe they’re being treated by a physician when they’re not. To safeguard patient trust and promote informed decision-making, it’s essential we uphold these laws and continue prioritizing transparency in health care.

Your catastrophic cap limits how much you and your family will pay for TRICARE covered healthcare services each calendar year.

“When your family reaches your catastrophic cap, TRICARE pays for all remaining covered costs,” said Debra Fisher, health system specialist, Policy & Programs Branch, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This means you won’t be responsible for the cost of the TRICARE-allowed portion of any covered service for the rest of the year.”

Each TRICARE plan has a catastrophic cap. Knowing how your catastrophic cap works can help you make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family members.

Q: What is my TRICARE catastrophic cap amount?

A: Your catastrophic cap amount is determined by:

Your TRICARE health plan

Your sponsor or beneficiary type

Your beneficiary group

You’re in Group A if your or your sponsor’s initial enlistment or appointment began before Jan. 1, 2018.

You’re in Group B if your or your sponsor’s initial enlistment or appointment began on or after Jan. 1, 2018.

Catastrophic cap amounts may change each year. The 2025 catastrophic cap ranges from $1,000 to $4,509, as shown in the tables below.

TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select catastrophic caps

Catastrophic caps for other TRICARE plans

The catastrophic cap for TRICARE For Life is $3,000.

Q: What costs count toward my catastrophic cap?

A:

Copayments and cost-shares for TRICARE-covered healthcare services, inpatient and outpatient

Enrollment fees

Deductibles

Pharmacy copayments and cost-shares

Other cost-shares, based on TRICARE-allowable charges, provider type, and location

Q: What costs don’t count toward my catastrophic cap?

A: Costs that don’t count toward your catastrophic cap include:

Costs for services not covered by TRICARE

Point-of-service fees

Charges from non-participating providers. (You pay the difference between the TRICARE-allowable charge and the balance billing limit, which is up to 15% above the TRICARE-allowable charge.)

Monthly or quarterly premiums for TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Young Adult, and the Continued Health Care Benefit Program

Extended Care Health Option sponsor and beneficiary liabilities

Q: How will I know if I’ve met my catastrophic cap?

A: Check your TRICARE explanation of benefits. Your EOB will show how much of what you paid applied toward your family’s catastrophic cap for the claim. It’ll also show the total amount you’ve paid toward your catastrophic cap for that calendar year.

Q: What happens if I meet my catastrophic cap amount?

A: If your family reaches your catastrophic cap, TRICARE will pay your portion of the TRICARE-allowable amount for the rest of the calendar year.

Keep in mind that you’ll still have to pay fees that don’t fall under the catastrophic cap.

Your catastrophic cap will reset to $0 on Jan. 1 each year.

Q: What happens to my catastrophic cap if I change plans mid-year?

A: If you change plans during the calendar year under the same sponsor, any amount credited toward your previous catastrophic cap will be credited toward your new catastrophic cap.

Q: What other ways can I keep my out-of-pocket costs lower?

A: Because not all costs count toward your catastrophic cap, it’s important to understand what TRICARE covers and your plan’s rules for getting care.

Here are a few things to keep in mind before you get care.

If you have a TRICARE Prime plan (including TYA-Prime):

Active duty service members: You need a referral for any care your PCM doesn’t provide. You can’t use the point-of-service option.

All others: You need a referral for most care your PCM doesn’t provide. If you see a specialist without a referral, you’re using the point-of-service option.

If you have a TRICARE Select plan or a TRICARE premium-based plan (including TYA-Select):

You can see any TRICARE-authorized network or non-network provider. However, you’ll have lower out-of-pocket costs if you get care from a TRICARE network provider.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250403-O-D0202-1001.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-04 12:56:17.960862

San Francisco, California--(Newsfile Corp. - April 4, 2025) - Shares of Zynex Inc.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

In February, News 3 first reported on counselors struggling to get paid because of changes to TRICARE, which handles health insurance for service members and their families.

TRICARE members make up about 25 percent of Lighthouse Counseling’s business.

Owner Meichell Worthing tells News 3 she thought the issues with TRICARE were going to be resolved by the end of March, but she said as of April 3, they hadn’t been.

She had stopped accepting new TRICARE clients and told current clients she won’t continue service for more than two weeks without a referral from a physician. Some clients, though, she said, are finding that getting in to see a physician can take months.

“Our service members and their families deserve better than this,"" said Worthing.

She said not getting paid from TRICARE was costing her business around $25,000 a month.

“I need to pay my staff. They can’t continue to go unpaid. So I’m going to have to get a loan. It’s going to have interest and all these other things on it and I’m going to be paying out of that to take care of my staff because I love my staff,"" Worthing explained. ""Not every business owner can do that, or would, but I shouldn’t have to. I shouldn’t have to get a loan to pay my staff because TRICARE’s not paying their bills.""

She worried the recent extension of the Norfolk-based USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group may increase the number of people needing counseling services, something she may not be able to provide.

In the meantime, there was also concern for current clients.

Elizabeth Hunter works with Worthing and remembers an interaction with a TRICARE client when she found out she wouldn’t be able to continue her service.

""She left my office in tears saying, 'I don’t know what I’m going to do.' That’s heartbreaking,"" Hunter said.

News 3 reached out to TRICARE for comment. A statement from the Defense Health Agency said in the region that includes Hampton Roads, fixes have been made and contract claims requirements should be met by April 30.

The TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractors in the East and West Regions, Humana Military and TriWest Healthcare Alliance respectively, both experienced claims processing issues at the start of the TRICARE 5th Generation contracts on January 1, 2025. Early slow claims processing was the result of two factors. First, at the beginning of every calendar year, as Medicare changes its rates, TRICARE is obligated to change its rates as well. Claims payments are always slightly slower in the first month of the year in order to make sure that those rates have been properly applied. Additionally, the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractors review the claims after submission to verify that the numbers and provider information are correct before claims are paid. This time frame has now passed, and claims are now flowing faster.

As of late -March 2025, Humana Military processed 3.9 million claims, which aligns with expected claims volumes. In the East Region, as of February 28th, Humana Military implemented technical fixes that improved claims processing and they are expected to meet contract claims requirements by April 30, 2025. Humana has stated that no providers have left the network due to claims issues.

Humana Military also sent News 3 a statement, which says, in part, the majority of issues have been fixed and they ""are working closely with impacted providers to ensure they continue to care for TRICARE East Region beneficiaries.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/979c423/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1876x985+0+43/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2F3f%2Ff632bc2d4ec3ba1744d98b31620b%2Fscreenshot-2025-04-03-at-5-06-52-pm.png,N,-1.0,2025-04-03 18:56:29.659533

She was behaving impulsively; hitting, kicking, and biting friends for seemingly no reason. I was getting calls a couple times a week, having to sign countless incident reports, and at a loss for how to curb these behaviors.

We were referred to Project Enlightenment and signed papers to have someone come observe. We went through the process, did our best to follow the advice we’d been given but were still struggling. These behaviors persisted till the end of her time in preschool (with a small break for Covid) where we ultimately pulled her out a few months early because we were tired of paying so much only to have her sent home early for bad behavior. We were realizing that her behaviors were extreme for her age but that didn’t mean we knew what to do.

When she was four, we made an appointment for parent counseling, again through Project Enlightenment. After a few sessions, our counselor asked if we had ever considered ADHD. We had not. In fact, aside from knowing a handful of kids in my youth that had been prescribed Ritalin, I didn’t know much about it at all.

In figuring out our next steps, we began exploring the possibility of psychological assessments. But where do we go? Who could do this for us? What about the months-long waitlists? If you’re anything like I was, you’re probably already overwhelmed and the thought of doing this research is yet another hurdle to jump. So with that being said, I have collected recommendations for practices from across the triangle that can perform psychological assessments and hopefully get you one step closer to finding answers for your family.

Maj. Troy E. Black, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a room full of Defense Health Agency staff while pointing to the American flag.

In a town hall meeting, Black told staff at the Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, the military operates at a “strategic level now, talking about what happens when nation states go to war, and how do we understand the scope and the scale of that?

“History is 100% accurate, no matter how we want to read it,” Black added. “There will be another conflict or war. They will go to scale.”

Black said the U.S. military needs to be ready for large-scale conflict like America hasn’t seen since World War II, including to ensure its medical system–military and civilian–is prepared for large and continuous waves of wounded.

He said DHA must proactively align its efforts with the changing character of warfare and the military's needs, rather than waiting for direction. He also noted the importance of close collaboration with the services and combatant commands to understand their evolving requirements and ensure DHA is prepared to provide necessary combat support.

Black emphasized the importance of standardizing medical treatment and casualty care across the services to ensure common standards of care, and the need to assess capabilities and resources to support high-casualty scenarios.

Underscoring the need to collaborate across the services, Black said, “All service branches do it differently. All have different equipment. All have different links of training to meet the same requirement or additional requirements. All do different platforms in a different uniform all the different ways,” adding, “We have to be focused on how we save a human being at the point of injury under fire by an adversary.”

First and foremost, Black stressed, is the need for service members to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice. He reiterated the need to come together to support the warfighter, as “you're dealing with the one thing: preservation of life.”

Black concluded by reminding everyone, “It’s not all bad news! Remember this: We win.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8952221/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-03 16:56:21.402766

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

— Kari Harman, VP of Business and Clinical Development

PENSACOLA , FL, UNITED STATES, April 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and HealWell HealthCare Solutions, a leading provider of antimicrobial gel, announced today that they have partnered to serve federal healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Lovell Government Services will serve as HealWell Solutions’ Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor to serve these customers through federal contracting systems.

HealWell Gel is FDA OTC and specifically indicated to ""treat"" wound infections as opposed to silver based and other forms labeled to ""prevent"". This distinction is for most part based on the fact that silver is antimicrobial only in ionic form and this form is known to be cytotoxic. Cytotoxicity is hard to document in vivo because the length of time it takes any given wound to heal is unknown. The cytotoxicity of ionic silver has been repeatedly demonstrated in the laboratory. HealWell Gel and its' PHMB concentration of 0.5% enjoys a toxic therapeutic ration of 14:1, ie: it is essentially non-toxic. HealWell Gel is an ideal antimicrobial primary dressing: effective against essentially all pathogens, protective barrier, donates moisture and biocide for up to 7 days for weekly changes. One tube of 45 grams/1.5oz may yield up to 30-40 applications.

As HealWell HealthCare Solutions’ SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. HealWell Solutions is available on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency’s Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). Listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

""We're excited to partner with HealWell Solutions to bring HealWell Gel to the federal healthcare space. This collaboration strengthens our commitment to providing innovative wound care solutions that support the healing of those who serve our nation.” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

“We are thrilled to partner with Lovell Government Services to provide a high quality, aimed at enhancing community collaborations. Through this partnership, we are committed to delivering evidence-based wound are products to support our Veterans, Military personnel and Indian Health Services."" said Kari Harman, RN, CCM, CWCA, WCN-C, CSWD-C, FCC, ACCWS, DAPWCA

Your catastrophic cap limits how much you and your family will pay for TRICARE covered healthcare services each calendar year.

“When your family reaches your catastrophic cap, TRICARE pays for all remaining covered costs,” said Debra Fisher, health system specialist, Policy & Programs Branch, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This means you won’t be responsible for the cost of the TRICARE-allowed portion of any covered service for the rest of the year.”

Each TRICARE plan has a catastrophic cap. Knowing how your catastrophic cap works can help you make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family members.

Q: What is my TRICARE catastrophic cap amount?

A: Your catastrophic cap amount is determined by:

Your TRICARE health plan

Your sponsor or beneficiary type

Your beneficiary group

You’re in Group A if your or your sponsor’s initial enlistment or appointment began before Jan. 1, 2018.

You’re in Group B if your or your sponsor’s initial enlistment or appointment began on or after Jan. 1, 2018.

Catastrophic cap amounts may change each year. The 2025 catastrophic cap ranges from $1,000 to $4,509, as shown in the tables below.

TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select catastrophic caps

Sponsor or Beneficiary Type Group A Group B Active duty family members $1,000 per family $1,288 per family Survivors of active duty deceased sponsor; medically retired uniformed service member and family members $3,000 per family $4,509 per family Retirees, family members of retirees, and qualified unremarried former spouses TRICARE Prime: $3,000 per family

TRICARE Select: $4,261 per family $4,509 per family

Catastrophic caps for other TRICARE plans

TRICARE Plan Group A Group B TRICARE Reserve Select Follow Group B $1,288 per family TRICARE Retired Reserve Follow Group B $4,509 per family TRICARE Young Adult Follow Group B Active duty family members: $1,288

Retiree family members: $4,509 Continued Health Care Benefit Program Follow Group B $4,509 per family

The catastrophic cap for TRICARE For Life is $3,000.

Q: What costs count toward my catastrophic cap?

A:

Copayments and cost-shares for TRICARE-covered healthcare services, inpatient and outpatient

Enrollment fees

Deductibles

Pharmacy copayments and cost-shares

Other cost-shares, based on TRICARE-allowable charges, provider type, and location

Q: What costs don’t count toward my catastrophic cap?

A: Costs that don’t count toward your catastrophic cap include:

Costs for services not covered by TRICARE

Point-of-service fees

Charges from non-participating providers. (You pay the difference between the TRICARE-allowable charge and the balance billing limit, which is up to 15% above the TRICARE-allowable charge.)

Monthly or quarterly premiums for TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Young Adult, and the Continued Health Care Benefit Program

Extended Care Health Option sponsor and beneficiary liabilities

Q: How will I know if I’ve met my catastrophic cap?

A: Check your TRICARE explanation of benefits. Your EOB will show how much of what you paid applied toward your family’s catastrophic cap for the claim. It’ll also show the total amount you’ve paid toward your catastrophic cap for that calendar year.

Q: What happens if I meet my catastrophic cap amount?

A: If your family reaches your catastrophic cap, TRICARE will pay your portion of the TRICARE-allowable amount for the rest of the calendar year.

Keep in mind that you’ll still have to pay fees that don’t fall under the catastrophic cap.

Your catastrophic cap will reset to $0 on Jan. 1 each year.

Q: What happens to my catastrophic cap if I change plans mid-year?

A: If you change plans during the calendar year under the same sponsor, any amount credited toward your previous catastrophic cap will be credited toward your new catastrophic cap.

Q: What other ways can I keep my out-of-pocket costs lower?

A: Because not all costs count toward your catastrophic cap, it’s important to understand what TRICARE covers and your plan’s rules for getting care.

Here are a few things to keep in mind before you get care.

If you have a TRICARE Prime plan (including TYA-Prime):

Active duty service members: You need a referral for any care your PCM doesn’t provide. You can’t use the point-of-service option.

All others: You need a referral for most care your PCM doesn’t provide. If you see a specialist without a referral, you’re using the point-of-service option.

If you have a TRICARE Select plan or a TRICARE premium-based plan (including TYA-Select):

Jeremiah Moore (right), R-Clarendon, present House Bill 1150 to the House Committee on Insurance and Commerce on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)

A House panel Wednesday approved a bill aimed at preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas.

Opponents outnumbered supporters in the public comment period of the House Insurance and Commerce Committee meeting, but a majority of the panel’s 21 members voted to send House Bill 1150 to the full House.

PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and they rank prescription drugs with the highest-tiered products costing consumers the lowest out-of-pocket costs. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.

“Pharmacy benefit managers are gaming the system to line their own pockets with taxpayers’ and patients’ money,” said HB 1150 sponsor Rep. Jeremiah Moore, R-Clarendon.

He decried the “patently false” statements circulating about the potential impact of HB 1150 from those who oppose it, such as the idea that 2.7 million Arkansans would lose access to health care. HB 1150 has faced a marketing campaign against it in the two and a half months since it was filed, and Moore said the opposition has primarily come from PBMs.

Some of Wednesday’s opponents of HB 1150 represented corporate health care organizations, including Russell Harper, a government relations executive with the Navitus Health Solutions PBM.

Harper said the bill “will result in lots of unintended consequences that will bring patient disruption, patient confusion and patient access issues to important drug treatments, not just in the commercial market, but in Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare.”

He claimed a wide swath of Arkansas pharmacies, including 23 within CVS and 26 within Kroger, would be at risk of closing if HB 1150 passes.

John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, denied the allegation that HB 1150 would force pharmacies to close by taking PBMs out of the competitive pharmacy market.

“It gives pharmacies a choice of whether they want to be a PBM or a pharmacy,” Vinson said. “[They would] pick one or the other.”

Debate

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding. Vinson said Wednesday that some PBMs force consumers to receive their medications via mail, which costs more than receiving them over the counter.

Mike Castleberry claimed HB 1150 would reduce mail-order pharmacies’ presence in Arkansas to the point that patients would not be able to access necessary medication. Castleberry is chief revenue officer at Consociate Health, which represents “self-funded employers” in Arkansas, and he said many pharmacies can only afford to provide specialty drugs if they use mail-order operations.

is someone who’s on a specialty drug,” he said.

Randy Zook, president of the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, said lawmakers should not make laws that attack vertical integration in business, but Vinson and Moore both said PBMs’ vertical integration is unique because they set their competitors’ prices.

OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark  the three largest PBMs  are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health, and District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis expressed opposition to HB 1150 on Wednesday. Ellis said pharmacists that work for PBM-owned and corporate pharmacies are still members of their local communities, and they have access to the medications and equipment that serve people with complex health needs while independent pharmacies do not necessarily have these things.

Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, said he received several emails from constituents who ostensibly opposed HB 1150 but said they “knew nothing about this” when he contacted them. He alleged that the emails came from lobbyists against HB 1150 who received his constituents’ personal information from CVS, where they told him they receive prescription drugs.

McGrew questioned Ellis about this “breach of integrity,” and Ellis said she was not aware of this.

Past legislative action

Navitus Chief Pharmacy Officer Sharon Faust said Arkansas has been “a frontrunner” on regulating prescription drug access and prices, but HB 1150 would be “a step too far, a step further where you’re actually limiting patient choice [and] reducing competition.”

Vinson and Moore said PBMs routinely reimburse their affiliate pharmacies at a higher rate than their competitors, locally-owned independent pharmacies.

This practice is outlawed in Arkansas by Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018, which became law after a special legislative session. Arkansas lawmakers have been attempting to regulate PBMs for the past decade, starting with Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs.

Despite this, pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) roughly 3,000 complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year. Independent pharmacists made similar claims in September, saying they were struggling to stay open in rural areas with limited healthcare resources.

The Arkansas Legislative Council approved a rule in December to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs.

Removing PBM-affiliated pharmacies from the market would require the employee benefits division of the Arkansas government “to reevaluate and restructure their pharmacy networks and implement new compliance measures,” according to an actuarial statement measuring the fiscal impact of HB 1150.

to the plan from excluding certain retail pharmacies from their network, such as CVS Caremark,” according to the statement. “Such a change would require a significant number of EBD members to transfer their prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy and may reduce pharmacy network access.”

The PATIENTS Framework (Publicly Accountable Transparent Interoperable Efficient Nonproprietary Transaction Standard) is our blueprint for healthcare administrative reform and a thoughtfully-designed system that centers the patient in the healthcare transaction.
The PATIENTS framework condenses the healthcare transaction into fewer, more transparent steps—most of which are completed prior to the patient receiving care.
We’re inviting forward-thinking leaders to join us in rebuilding healthcare administration into something that truly serves patient care.","San Diego, CA–April 3, 2025–The United States healthcare system has broken under the weight of its own complexity. We spend about $5 trillion dollars on healthcare, or 17.6% of GDP, an outlier among all nations, with minimal compelling healthcare outcomes to show for it. Patients are lost, frustrated and forced into passive participation in their own healthcare journey. It’s not a poorly designed system, it’s a system that was never designed.

So we took the best and brightest minds across the healthcare industry and designed a new way forward.

How did we get here?

It was compounded piece by piece: the creation of employer-sponsored healthcare during World War II, the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, new billing codes, HIPAA rules, Meaningful Use requirements, and the Affordable Care Act. All well-meaning, but designed without consideration for the entire ecosystem. As a result, we have Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, and private insurance all running on different systems, with different rules for billing, approvals, and benefits—a chain of unnecessarily complex steps to accomplish straightforward tasks at exponentially rising costs.

But there’s hope. We’ve solved similarly complex, far-reaching problems before. Banks share common transaction standards through federal clearinghouses. Mortgage lenders simplified their agreements through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Even other countries with private healthcare, like Germany, have successfully standardized health plan designs and clinical policies across their entire system.

So we took the best and brightest minds across the healthcare industry and designed a new way forward. The PATIENTS Framework (Publicly Accountable Transparent Interoperable Efficient Nonproprietary Transaction Standard) is our blueprint for healthcare administrative reform and a thoughtfully-designed system that centers the patient in the healthcare transaction.

Patients deserve better

Incentive misalignment between business stakeholders in healthcare has resulted in an inadequate patient (and consumer) experience, lack of competition, outdated transaction processes, and dysfunctional payer-provider relationships. The numbers tell a stark story: 30% of all healthcare spending is wasted on administrative costs. This makes administrative complexity the single biggest component of excess US spending.

We believe the key to cutting administrative costs is replacing the patchwork of old, proprietary systems between health plans, providers, and middle men with a system that is simple, standardized, transparent, and most of all, patient-centered.

A truly patient-centered system is one that makes the complex simple; the fragmented, standardized; the opaque, transparent; the proprietary, open license; and most importantly, (we really can’t say it enough) the business-centered, patient centered.

When we get this right, healthcare works better for everyone:

Patients know exactly what their care will cost—and what quality to expect

Doctors and insurance companies work from the same, transparent playbook

Insurance plans use standardized benefit and network designs

Providers adopt standard processes for billing and patient payments

Everyone understands each step and can precisely predict their financial responsibility

How it works

We started by asking a fundamental question: In today’s world, what’s the simplest way to handle healthcare payments while ensuring excellent patient care?

From there, we developed the core tenets of an efficient transaction:

Consider the patient first

Strive for a perfectly efficient, payer-provider integrated transaction

Ensure backwards compatibility to existing transaction rails and payment systems

Set open license standards for interoperability

Create transparent documentation that anyone can understand

Then, we took a look at the status quo. Today, all healthcare transactions follow the Revenue Cycle: a 10+ step, months-long process that begins with scheduling an appointment and ends with patient collections and reporting. The PATIENTS framework condenses the healthcare transaction into fewer, more transparent steps—most of which are completed prior to the patient receiving care.

To see this in action, the framework includes these essential pieces:

Standard Modular Provider <> Group Purchaser Contract

Open Payment, Grouping and Pricing System

Universal Clinical Coverage Library

Standard Plan Design and Benefits Mapping

Open and Patient-Facing Transaction Rails

The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) offers vital support to military families with special needs by coordinating a wide range of military and civilian community resources. These resources include educational, medical, housing, and personnel services, all aimed at enhancing the quality of life for service members and their families. EFMP provides a comprehensive approach to ensure that families receive the assistance they need to thrive.

Understanding the Three Components of EFMP

EFMP-Family Support Navigator Zuhal Rick explains, “The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) provides comprehensive support through three components: EFMP Medical, Assignments and Family Support- each addressing different aspects of care and assistance, and all working together collectively.

EFMP-M (Medical)

EFMP-Medical is in the Ramstein Clinic (Building 2114, 1st Floor) on Ramstein AB, Germany. This component serves Ramstein and over 170 geographically separated units, including Stuttgart, Rota, and Morón. EFMP Medical handles various processes such as EFMP Enrollment, EFMP Disenrollment, Family Member Travel Screenings for PCS, Command Sponsorship, EFMP Reassignments, Humanitarian Reassignment Support, Newborn Letters, Travel Appeal Support, and Tricare ECHO Enrollment.

More information can be found on the EFMP Website https://www.ramstein.af.mil/Medical/EFMP/.

EFMP-A (Assignments)

This component works closely with EFMP families to coordinate the relocation of Exceptional Family Members (EFMs) with their sponsors. It also assists with EFMP Reassignments and Humanitarian assignments when necessary.

EFMP-FS (Family Support)

EFMP-Family Support provides information, resources, skills, and support to help military families with special needs navigate their systems of care. As families gain confidence, they become effective advocates for themselves and their family members, thereby improving their quality of life. EFMP-FS helps families on the path to empowerment by offering information and referral services, non-medical case management, training, and opportunities for families to connect around common needs or concerns.

Services Provided by EFMP-FS are:

Non-clinical Case Management: Assisting families with developing a Family Services Plan, providing information and referrals, and offering guidance on navigating the unique challenges of special needs in the military environment.

Navigating EFMP Components: Helping families understand and connect with the medical and assignments components of EFMP.

Encouraging Advocacy: Connecting families to relevant resources and ensuring they have the most relevant information needed to make informed decisions.

Educational Classes: Offering educational classes such as EFMP 101, Power Hour (partnered with Health Promotions), Plan My Move, and more.

Warm Handoff to Gaining Installation: Ensuring a smooth transition by providing a warm handoff to the gaining installation.

Recreational Events: Hosting fun and engaging activities for EFMP members and their families, such as the Teddy Bear Picnic (partnering with USO), Play Group, Sensory Storytime at the Library, Pumpkin Palooza, Trips to local Zoo, Dinosaur Park & Japanese Garden, Adults Only Special Events, Holiday Crafts, Family Bingo Nights, Rock Climbing, and more.

Support Groups: Creating a sense of community by facilitating support groups, such as Conversation Corner with EFMP, to bring EFMP families together.

Mrs. Rick shared valuable insights into the team’s mission, stating, “Your EFMP Family Support Team is comprised of three dedicated Coordinators: Shellby McBride, Adia Ward, and Brittany Callahan, with myself as the Navigator. Our primary goal is to provide services and programs that cater to families with diverse special needs. We understand that the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) can be confusing and stressful, but that is precisely why our team exists – to offer guidance and support every step of the way. We look forward to welcoming all our EFMP families to our upcoming events and programs.”

As the military continues to face the challenges of overseas deployments and assignments and need for mental health support grows, the Student Support Roadmap will remain a vital resource, providing a foundation for the mental and behavioral health support that military children need to succeed.","Leaders from David G. Farragut Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) school and Naval Hospital Rota have collaborated to create a Student Support Roadmap, a comprehensive resource guide for youth in need of mental and behavioral health support. Modeled from the Navy’s Mental Health Roadmap, this tool outlines the pathway of services and resources available to military and civilian students who attend the DoDEA school, located on Naval Station Rota. For families stationed overseas, where access to mental health resources can be limited, reducing barriers to utilizing support services is essential.

The Student Support Roadmap outlines nine primary resources for students, including installation Chaplains, Fleet and Family Center counselors, Military Health System providers, imbedded school assets and emergency services. Incorporating a stop light color scale, it allows users to identify levels of care available, ranging from no issues for safety, which might be most appropriate for a Chaplain or Military and Family Life Counselor, to needing immediate care from the Emergency Room or Crisis Line.

“When first introduced to the Mental Health Roadmap I immediately saw its usefulness for adults and wondered, where is the corresponding roadmap for youth on base?” stated Scott Cypers, a Child Psychologist and Department Head of the Educational and Developmental Intervention Service. Working with partners from across the installation, Dr Cypers was able to bring his vision of a youth centric roadmap to life.

This proactive and preventative approach aims to identify and address potential issues before they escalate into more serious problems. The roadmap is tailored to meet the unique needs of military children, who often face challenges such as frequent moves, parental deployments, and adjusting to new environments.

“I do hope the Student Support Roadmap benefits parents and youth who may not be aware of all the options and how to access them for kids who have mental health concerns,” shared Dr. Cypers.

The collaboration between DoDEA and Naval Hospital Rota has been instrumental in the development and implementation of this tool. DoDEA brings its expertise in education and student support, while clinicians at Naval Hospital Rota provide knowledge and resources in mental and behavioral health care. This partnership has enabled the creation of a holistic and integrated approach to supporting children of Department of Defense personnel, one that addresses their academic, social, and emotional needs.

“Our goal with the Student Support Roadmap is to ensure that every student, regardless of their circumstances, has access to the right resources at the right time,” said Mr. Daniel Gostkowski, Assistant Principal of David G. Farragut DoDEA School. “We want to foster a school environment where students feel safe, supported, and understood, so they can focus on learning and personal growth”.

The Student Support Roadmap, implemented in January of 2025, has been widely shared through school and hospital outreach and messaging. DoDEA supports about 900 students in its installation base schools, though the opportunity for this tool to be used extends to the approximately 2400 DoD youth who rely on Naval Station Rota resources.

By providing a clear pathway for support, families can quickly and easily access the resources they need to help their children thrive. One of the key benefits of the student support roadmap is its focus on early intervention and prevention. By identifying and addressing potential issues early on, military children are more likely to receive the support they need to succeed academically and socially. This approach helps reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues, encouraging families to seek help when they need it.

As the military continues to face the challenges of overseas deployments and assignments and need for mental health support grows, the Student Support Roadmap will remain a vital resource, providing a foundation for the mental and behavioral health support that military children need to succeed.

Naval Hospital Rota, located strategically at the gateway of the Mediterranean, generates and sustains readiness to deliver critical medical support for Department of Defense missions throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

As a result of this, some local providers told 10 On Your Side they haven’t been paid by Tricare since the beginning of the year.
About 25% of clients that Lighthouse Counseling in Virginia Beach serve use Tricare.
Elizabeth Hunter, a licensed professional counselor at Lighthouse Counseling, said she has not been paid by Tricare since January.
Months after the claims change, Meichell Worthing, Lighthouse Counseling owner, said the situation is continuing to impact her business.","VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) — Recent changes to the claims process for Tricare, the health insurance program for military members and their families, has impacted mental health clinics in Hampton Roads.

On Jan.1, a company named PGBA LLC began processing claims for the Tricare East Region.

However, a spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the East Region, told NBC News that a “small percentage” of provider records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data that prevented claims from being processed in January.

As a result of this, some local providers told 10 On Your Side they haven’t been paid by Tricare since the beginning of the year.

About 25% of clients that Lighthouse Counseling in Virginia Beach serve use Tricare. The practice said some of their counselors aren’t getting paid for the service they provide to those clients.

Elizabeth Hunter, a licensed professional counselor at Lighthouse Counseling, said she has not been paid by Tricare since January. She estimates she is owed around $6,000.

“When Tricare switched claims processing companies, that data migration didn’t happen well and data was lost, and my credentialing was lost in that process,” Hunter said.

Hunter explained that because she is a licensed professional counselor, her Tricare patients now have to get a referral through their primary care manager to continue to see her or it won’t be covered.

“My last client of the day told me [that] ‘to get a physician’s referral will take me three months. I cannot pay out of pocket, and I don’t know what to do,’” Hunter said.

Months after the claims change, Meichell Worthing, Lighthouse Counseling owner, said the situation is continuing to impact her business.

“Tricare represents roughly $25,000 a month for our practice,” Worthing said. “And so, we’re at three months in, that’s about $75,000 that we are out of on some level. They did give us a prepayment in January for some money to help the transition, but then haven’t really helped since then, and we’re still in the scenario where many of our counselors have not been paid for the services they’ve already provided.”

Meanwhile, Lighthouse Counseling clients that use Tricare such as Alex Arnold are trying to figure out what to do next.

“I don’t have a [primary care manager] to monitor my health, because nobody’s taking me in the time that the Navy has me here, which is only eight months,” Arnold said. “I don’t have many necessities healthcare-wise, [but] I would almost rather go with a broken arm for eight months than [going] without counseling for eight months.”

Going forward, Lighthouse Counseling offered its Tricare clients a new system where they will prepay for their services and the practice will reimburse them once Tricare pays them.

“Our servicemen and women and their families deserve better,” Hunter said. “They should not be having to go through this. They struggle enough, they have sacrificed enough and they should not have to sacrifice their mental health care because of some glitch in the system. Fix it sooner [rather] than later. Stop trying to deny it, stop trying to give misinformation. Figure out what the left hand is doing and what the right hand is doing and make it right.”

Opioid addiction is a national crisis—and military families aren’t immune. Whether you’re on active duty, a veteran, or a family member covered under TRICARE, you may be wondering how to get treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD).

The good news? TRICARE opioid rehab coverage is available and knowing your options can help you or your loved one take that first step towards recovery. TRICARE, while primarily known for serving military families, also covers civilian health care needs including mental health and addiction treatment services.

In this guide we’ll break down everything you need to know about TRICARE covered opioid rehab from the types of treatment available to how to get started so you can make informed decisions with confidence.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the healthcare program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. It provides comprehensive medical coverage including mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. If you’re covered under any TRICARE plan—TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE For Life, or TRICARE Reserve Select—you have access to opioid rehab services.

TRICARE covers many types of psychotherapy including various counseling formats and psychological testing. That’s important because opioid addiction isn’t just a personal issue—it affects the whole family and timely evidence-based care can make all the difference.

TRICARE Health Insurance Overview

TRICARE is a health insurance program specifically designed for military families and veterans so they have access to quality healthcare services. This program is part of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System and is designed to support the health and well-being of active-duty service members, retirees and their families.

TRICARE-Covered Detox Programs

Detox is often the first step in opioid rehab. It involves safely managing withdrawal symptoms under medical supervision. Opioid withdrawal can be intense—nausea, sweating, anxiety, muscle pain, and cravings are common.

Outpatient treatment includes various levels such as standard outpatient programs, intensive outpatient programs (IOPs), and partial hospitalization programs (PHPs). TRICARE covers both inpatient and outpatient detox if medically necessary. This is usually determined by a TRICARE-authorized provider. Inpatient detox may be required if withdrawal symptoms are severe or if there are co-occurring conditions that need closer monitoring.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) and TRICARE

MAT is a proven, science-backed approach to treating opioid addiction. It combines FDA-approved medications—like buprenorphine (Suboxone), methadone, or naltrexone (Vivitrol)—with counseling and behavioral therapies. MAT reduces cravings, prevents relapse, and supports long-term recovery.

Selecting an in-network provider is key to minimizing out-of-pocket costs and ensuring full coverage under TRICARE.

TRICARE covers MAT, including:

Office visits with a prescribing provider

Medication management

Behavioral health counseling

Urine drug testing as part of treatment monitoring

You’ll need to see a TRICARE-authorized provider and in some cases get pre-authorization. But if MAT is medically necessary TRICARE will likely cover it.

If outpatient care isn’t enough TRICARE also covers residential treatment programs for opioid addiction. Inpatient rehab provides a structured environment with 24/7 care, ideal for individuals with severe addiction, unstable home environments, or co-occurring mental health disorders.

In a residential program you can expect:

Medically supervised detox (if needed)

Individual and group therapy

Trauma-informed care

Life skills training

Relapse prevention planning

TRICARE covers residential treatment when medically necessary and when provided by a TRICARE-authorized facility. Prior authorization is usually required so working with a case manager or treatment coordinator can help streamline the process.

Setting up a payment plan with healthcare providers can help manage expenses not covered by TRICARE insurance.

Outpatient Rehab Options with TRICARE

Not everyone needs to go away for treatment. Physical health complications can hinder veterans’ ability to participate effectively in traditional treatment programs, highlighting the need for tailored approaches. Many individuals succeed with outpatient opioid rehab and TRICARE offers several levels of care, including bother inpatient and outpatient treatment programs.

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP)

PHPs provide intensive, structured care during the day, usually 5–7 days a week while allowing patients to return home in the evenings. It’s a good middle ground for those who need more than standard outpatient care but don’t require 24/7 supervision.

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP)

IOPs typically involve 9–15 hours of therapy per week, offering flexibility for people who have work or family commitments. TRICARE covers IOPs for opioid addiction when medically necessary.

Standard Outpatient Therapy

This is the least intensive level of care and may include weekly therapy sessions, medication management, and ongoing support. It’s often used as a step-down from more intensive programs or for people in long-term recovery.",https://tricarerehabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TRICARE-Opioid-Rehab.webp,N,1.0,2025-04-02 17:56:21.499339

SAN FRANCISCO , April 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A securities class action has been filed against Zynex, Inc.

Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Securities Class Action:

The litigation is focused on the propriety of Zynex's statements about its sales and billing practices, its revenue recognition practices, and its relationship with the military health program for active-duty soldiers and their family members (""Tricare""), which represents 20 – 25% of company's revenue.

The complaint alleges that Zynex made false and misleading statements while failing to disclose crucial information to investors. More specifically, the suit alleges that:

Zynex shipped product, including electrodes, in excess of customers' needs;

As a result of this practice, Zynex inflated its revenues;

Zynex's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

As a. result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and penalties by the federal government.

Investors began to learn the truth on June 4, 2024, when medical journal STAAT published ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" This report claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" STAAT further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The company's Q4 revenue implied a 2% drop from the year-earlier period and YE net income per share plummeted from $0.27 in 2023 to $0.09 in 2024. According to Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard ""[o]ur fourth quarter revenue was less than expected[]"" and ""[t]he shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

""We are concerned about potential issues with Zynex's revenue recognition and sales practices,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.
