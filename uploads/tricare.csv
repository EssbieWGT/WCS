Recognizing this, TRICARE covers many substance abuse treatments, including drug and alcohol rehab and alcohol detox. Knowing what's covered is key for veterans to get back to health and well-being.

In this article for Start Motion Media, we will cover if TRICARE covers alcohol detox, what services are included and how to get treatment. We will also go over how to navigate the system so detox services are fully covered.

Health Coverage for Alcohol Detox

TRICARE is a health insurance program for active-duty service members, retirees and their families. It covers mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment which includes alcohol detox. But coverage varies depending on the veteran's TRICARE plan, the facility's network status and medical necessity.

What Type of Alcohol Detox Does TRICARE Cover?

TRICARE generally covers both inpatient and outpatient detox when medically necessary.

Inpatient Detox: This is for individuals who need 24/7 medical supervision to manage withdrawal symptoms safely. Veterans with severe withdrawal or co-occurring disorders may need inpatient care.

Outpatient Detox: This is for individuals with milder withdrawal symptoms and a stable home environment. Treatment includes medication-assisted therapy (MAT), counseling and regular medical supervision.

VA Health Care and Addiction Treatment

VA health care covers comprehensive addiction treatment including substance use disorder treatment and mental health services. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a range of services to address substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions.

Veterans can get addiction treatment services through their local VA medical center or clinic or through vet Centers. VA also offers evidence-based treatment for substance use disorder including therapies, medication or both.

Find Veteran Detox Centers at Your Local VA Medical Center

Veterans seeking alcohol detox services should start by making sure the facility they choose is TRICARE-approved. Many treatment programs across the country accept TRICARE so it's easy to find good care. Finding TRICARE detox centers nationwide will help veterans connect with the right facility for them.

TRICARE divides healthcare providers into network and non-network facilities:

Network providers have agreements with TRICARE so out-of-pocket costs are lower. Non-network providers may still accept TRICARE but may require higher co-pays or extra paperwork for approval.

How to Get Detox Covered by VA Health Benefits as a Veteran

Navigating TRICARE's coverage can be overwhelming but knowing the steps can make it easier. Here's how veterans can get detox covered by insurance as a veteran:

Confirm Eligibility: TRICARE coverage depends on the veteran's specific health insurance plan. TRICARE Prime, Select and Reserve Select have different levels of coverage for detox services.

Get a Referral or Pre-Authorization: Some detox programs require a referral from a TRICARE-authorized provider. Check with TRICARE or the treatment facility to confirm requirements.

Choose a Covered Facility: Select a treatment center within TRICARE's network to maximize benefits and minimize out-of-pocket costs.

Understand Co-Pays and Costs: Depending on the TRICARE plan there may be no out-of-pocket costs for detox services.

Seek Continued Care: Detox is the first step in long-term recovery. TRICARE also covers follow-up services such as inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient counseling and medication-assisted treatment (MAT).

Using VA Health Benefits for Private Rehab

Veterans can use their VA health benefits to pay for private addiction treatment. VA allows veterans to supplement their VA benefits with other insurance plans such as private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE.

Veterans should inform their addiction treatment provider about their multiple insurance coverages and VA will bill the supplemental health insurance provider first. Payments received from other insurance providers can offset some or all of the VA copay costs.

Additional Health Benefits for Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Choosing the right treatment program is key to long-term recovery. Beyond detox TRICARE covers:

Residential rehabilitation programs for veterans who need structured long-term treatment.

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) that provide intensive daytime treatment while allowing individuals to go home at night.

Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) for veterans who need structured therapy but can still maintain daily responsibilities.

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to manage withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.

Individual and group therapy sessions to address underlying mental health issues related to addiction.

Your Rights and VA Health-Covered Rehab

Veterans have the right to confidentiality when seeking addiction treatment through VA health care. However, there may be some limitations to this right such as the Military Command Exception which allows for disclosure of treatment information to Command officers in certain circumstances.

Veterans should understand their rights and the limitations of confidentiality when seeking addiction treatment through VA health care.

Barriers to Treatment and How to Overcome Them

While TRICARE covers detox and other substance use treatments some veterans may face barriers to care. Common challenges include:

Lack of Awareness: Many veterans are not aware TRICARE covers alcohol detox.

Bureaucratic Challenges: Navigating the healthcare system can be complicated especially when referrals or pre-authorizations are required.

Stigma Surrounding Addiction: Some veterans may not seek help due to the stigma of substance use disorders.

To overcome these barriers:

Educate Yourself: Understanding TRICARE benefits can empower veterans to seek the care they need.

Reach Out for Help: Veteran support organizations and TRICARE representatives can help.

Advocate for Your Health: Be proactive in seeking care and understanding treatment options.

Navigating VA Health Benefits with Support

Veterans can navigate their VA health benefits with support from their primary care provider at the VA. Advocating for oneself by telling the VA provider you want to see a community care provider can be a big step.

Tricare Rehabs can help veterans navigate the process and understand what steps are needed to get authorized for care. Our veteran advocates are trained to help veterans understand VA health benefits and the process of getting care.

Payment Options and Financing for Veteran Rehab

Veterans have several payment options and financing options for rehab. VA health benefits can cover the cost of addiction treatment and veterans can also use their VA benefits to supplement other insurance plans.

VA has various financing options including copays and deductibles and veterans can also look into private financing options such as loans or credit cards. Veterans should discuss payment options and financing options with their addiction treatment provider to determine the best course of action.

When exhaustion becomes a normal aspect of your life, it’s easy to brush it off as part of getting older or having to balance the rigors of civilian life.

But for many veterans, that overwhelming fatigue has a medical cause—untreated sleep apnea.

Every night, your airway may be closing dozens or hundreds of times, cutting off oxygen and forcing your brain to jolt you awake in order to breathe.

The following signs become more and more obvious because you’re prevented from reaching deep, restorative sleep—even if you’re in bed for seven to eight hours:

You wake up groggy and often with a headache

You notice slower reaction times or sluggish reflexes

You have difficulty concentrating on your day-to-day tasks

Your memory lapses are beginning to interfere with daily life

You are quick to go from feeling happy to sad, irritable, or angry

Your energy tanks by mid-day

No amount of caffeine seems to help

Let us help. Sleep Apnea Solutions – Texas Hill Country is Tricare-approved and part of the VA Community Care Network.

This means you may be eligible for a fully covered, custom-fitted oral appliance at no cost to you.

We can fit you with a device similar to a mouthguard that improves your breathing function while you sleep.

There’s no waiting period and no out-of-pocket expense if you have Tricare.

If you’ve already had a sleep study through the VA, you could be fitted for the appliance right away. We’ll help you get one scheduled if not.

Dental Appliances for Sleep Apnea Patients in Texas Hill Country

Tricare covers custom oral appliances for veterans with sleep apnea, but acquiring one isn’t always as straightforward as it should be.

You might not know where to start or be stuck waiting on VA approvals that seem to take forever.

That’s why we have built our process around one goal—getting your treatment approved and delivered as quickly as possible without the runaround.

Sleep Apnea Solutions – Texas Hill Country Can Help

We’ll verify your Tricare benefits and confirm if you already have a qualifying sleep study on record the moment you reach out to us.

If you don’t, we’ll help coordinate a sleep test through the local VA office or an authorized civilian provider.

We schedule your consultation immediately and fast-track the appointment so you can receive digital scans of your teeth and jaw once your referral is approved.

Your custom oral appliance will be fabricated and ready for fitting within two to three weeks of this appointment.

Step 1: Get a Referral

You must obtain a referral from a VA provider before starting treatment with us if you already receive healthcare through the VA Community Care Program.

You can request a sleep medicine referral through My HealtheVet or by calling your local VA office if you have a VA primary care provider.

If you don’t have a VA PCP or you haven’t been evaluated for sleep apnea yet, our team can help you request a consultation through the Texas Hill Country VA system.

We’ll walk you through exactly what to say to them to avoid unnecessary delays and handle all the paperwork and pre-authorizations once your referral is approved.

You may or may not need a referral if you have Tricare Prime, Select, or Tricare for Life.

We always confirm your specific coverage upfront so you know exactly what to expect.

Step 2: Take a Sleep Study

If you haven’t had a sleep study in the past 12 months, the VA or Tricare may require one before approving an oral appliance.

The VA can provide a home sleep apnea test free of charge if you’re using VA benefits. This usually requires another referral.

We can arrange a home sleep study through a private Tricare-approved provider.

Home-based testing is very simple. You wear a small device at home for one night, and a board-certified sleep physician analyzes the data.

You will be eligible for an oral appliance if your study confirms obstructive sleep apnea.

We’ll request your report from the VA office or help you get a copy for VA and Tricare approval if you have already taken the study.

Step 3: Receive Your FDA-approved Oral Appliance

Once your sleep apnea diagnosis is confirmed, we begin the pre-authorization process to get your appliance approved.

The VA office issues an authorization number to see us under Community Care and we submit all necessary treatment plans to ensure your device is fully paid for.

You pay nothing—the VA covers 100% of the cost for eligible veterans.

We can also verify your Tricare coverage and any required documentation.

We will handle additional medical justification for you if they ask.

We should have 6 to 10 large civilian medical centers committed to hosting active duty and reserve military personnel as their usual place of work for casualty receiving bed capacity and military medical personnel skills maintenance.","The Military Health System (MHS) is a unique organization with broad responsibility. On one hand, it plays a critical role in the care of injured U.S. service members. On the other hand, it has also been tasked with providing healthcare services to nearly 10 million military personnel and their families

Any organization of this scale will struggle with inefficiency and redundancy. For decades, I have heard some question whether we need an MHS at all. I believe the solid answer is yes due to the system’s unique mission.

However, in this time of government restructuring and downsizing, there lies an opportunity. As the new administration looks to cut waste and unneeded programs from the federal government, now is the time to right-size the MHS and refocus it on its unique mission — providing deployed medical care.

Current landscape of U.S. military healthcare

First, some background: Concurrently with casualty care, the MHS serves all the medical needs of 9.5 million beneficiaries around the world. This includes active duty service members, their families and military retirees. The system’s FY24 budget of $58.7 billion represents 7% of the total Department of Defense (DoD) budget of $842 billion.

Arguably the most unique and important function of the MHS is to care for combat injuries and other unique wartime disease. For that reason, one would believe that most of the system’s spending would be dedicated to this mission. However, the fact is that the majority of the MHS budget goes toward (a) operating the military hospitals known as Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) to care for beneficiaries and (b) paying for purchased care in locations without an MTF.

While most MTFs are dedicated to beneficiary care, a number of larger MTFs — such as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center — also serve as casualty receiving hospitals for service members who are critically ill or injured while deployed. In fact, a handful of major MTFs have cared for over 50,000 wounded service members since 2001. This “final mile” of trauma care is a key aspect of the MHS mission, and it includes the acute critical care phase through surgical reconstruction, rehabilitation and restoration of function.

The combat care mission of the MHS is embodied in the Joint Trauma System (JTS), which provides clinical leadership and oversight to the trauma care provided to injured service members. This care extends from initial battlefield treatment, to forward deployed surgical teams, to care during evacuation, and finally to ongoing critical care and rehabilitation at major MTFs.

Although the JTS does not own or command military medics and medical units, it ensures the clinical knowledge and skills readiness of medical personnel, provides best practice guidelines for all roles of care in deployed combat medicine, and advises commanders at all levels regarding the synchronization of operational and clinical decision making.

The JTS was initially established in 2003 at a time when the number of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan were ramping up and there was a realization that the MHS needed to step up to meet these demands. Since then, the JTS continues to be a critical component of the unique MHS mission and has matured into a permanent organization to continuously stand ready to ensure the best care for our military service members who bravely fight for our freedom around the world.

Why the current plan is not working

We are currently in a relatively quiescent interwar period, but future conflicts with peer opponents such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran present the risk of higher numbers of combat casualties for protracted periods of time.

What can the MHS do in between conflicts to sustain the trauma capabilities of the MTFs as well as the skills of medical personnel who must be immediately ready to go?

The usual answer is to leverage the system’s “beneficiary care” mission to maintain trauma readiness. Unfortunately, there are several issues with this idea.

First, the active duty beneficiaries and their families who use MTFs are a generally healthy population. As such, they can provide military medical personnel with nearly no experience in delivering complex medical and surgical care. In fact, the military has allowed a large portion of its older beneficiaries (who often do require complex care) to receive their care through Tricare contracts, meaning purchased civilian healthcare. Still other retirees and veterans receive care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The end result is the common situation where active duty medical personnel (including physicians and nurses) are assigned to work in MTFs that have very few patients.

Second, most major MTFs do not have a civilian trauma care mission to bolster their trauma readiness. (The one exception is Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, which is the military’s only Level I trauma center.) In some locations, the military MTF is perceived as unneeded by the surrounding community because a sufficient number of civilian trauma centers exist. In other locations, state governments have simply refused to allow local MTFs to be included in the civilian trauma care system. It is true that some jurisdictions have allowed MTFs to participate in the civilian trauma system as extra capacity during extreme circumstances (such as disasters), but this is not enough to sustain these MTFs with a steady flow of patients. In a handful of cases, states have allowed MTFs to send personnel to local civilian trauma centers. While this is helpful for sustaining the skills of the individuals involved, it does little to help non-participating medical personnel or sustain the MTF trauma program itself.

Third, the nationwide shortage of both physicians and nurses means that there are not enough graduating providers to fill the needs of civilian hospitals much less the U.S. military. The Uniformed Services University (USU) School of Medicine and Nursing in Bethesda, Maryland, educates a critical mass of career military medical officers who fill the majority of medical operational positions such as command surgeons. The major MTFs provide the training sites for these future military medical personnel; but, as noted above, many do not have the patient volumes to succeed in this mission. Similarly, the civilian sector cannot support training slots for the numbers and types of specialties required by the DoD to provide battlefield trauma and medical care.

How to refocus and strengthen the MHS

Given the challenges facing military healthcare, I propose that the time is now for the MHS to right-size and refocus on its core mission. To get this right, we must create a coherent strategy based on the unique aspects and critical responsibilities of the MHS.

1. Refocus on the core military mission

The first priority should be to refocus the MHS budget and operations on combat casualty care and deployed medical care. The MHS should be transformed into a functional medical command whose only mission is providing optimal care for deployed military service members around the globe.

This functional command will focus on deployed medicine, including combat casualty care from the point of injury to transport and initial life-saving stabilization. It will serve to sustain and augment the two decades of knowledge and experience developed by the JTS.

2. Invest in core MTFs, divest from the rest

The status quo of taxpayer-funded MTFs that are bereft of patients has not worked for decades. However, we cannot close all the MTFs to cut costs because the MHS would then lose the ability to complete its most critical mission. The solution is to maintain and invest heavily in a core group of major MTFs that support the unique military mission of the MHS and divest from the rest.

We can begin by strategically identifying 6 to 10 major MTFs in the continental U.S. and 4 to 6 others in key locations around the globe. We should then reduce or eliminate purchased civilian care for beneficiaries except for locations not in reasonable proximity to a core MTF. This change will fill the core MTFs with beneficiary patients, which will enhance training for military providers and help maintain MTF capabilities for future conflicts.

3. Reduce redundancy between MTFs and VA hospitals

The third priority is to reduce the redundancy between the Veteran’s Administration (VA) health system and the DoD MHS. In locations where both federal departments operate a hospital, the VA hospital can be combined with the military MTF or eliminated. This will reduce redundancy and costs while still abiding by our promise to care for retirees and veterans who have served valiantly. It will also provide more complex patients to help maintain the skills and the capabilities of the core MTFs.

4. Invest in the military medicine training pipeline

Concurrently, we need to invest in the education and training of medical personnel for the unique military medical mission. USU should be leveraged as the centerpiece of this system, since it has a proven record of educating military medical students who often serve out a 20-year career and who also tend to fill many of the military’s command surgeon positions. The core MTFs can provide essential training during a time when the country is suffering from a shortage of physicians and nurses.

As we all know, it takes years to educate and train military medical personnel, so building this pipeline is not something we can decide at the last minute when a conflict develops. Acting on this now is the only way to ensure we have a continuously flowing pipeline of medical personnel ready for the next conflict.

5. Embrace military-civilian partnerships

Lastly, DoD and civilian healthcare leaders should embrace military-civilian partnerships as a national responsibility and priority. A handful of civilian trauma centers should maintain military hospital staff and beds within their walls. This arrangement will provide personnel and resources to care for injured and ill civilians during normal times, and it can also provide rapid capacity for responding in times of disaster.

The “Mission Zero Act” already describes this arrangement, but the legislation needs to be fully funded and probably further enhanced. We should have 6 to 10 large civilian medical centers committed to hosting active duty and reserve military personnel as their usual place of work for casualty receiving bed capacity and military medical personnel skills maintenance.

Big change needed

Those of us who have served a medical career in the U.S. military implicitly understand what needs to be done to correct the course of the MHS.

Attempts at making incremental changes to the MHS have failed for decades. That’s the status quo. Without big change — and now seems to be the right time for suggesting big change — the MHS will not be ready for future conflicts.

If the new administration decides to address waste reduction in the DoD, it needs to start by assembling a team of military medical subject matter experts who have not been part of maintaining the status quo.

The MHS must remain intact to prevent loss of life and provide rehabilitation and recovery for those injured protecting our freedom, but refocusing the system on its core military mission is critical to ensuring that we are ready for future conflicts",https://trauma-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cropped-android-chrome-512x512-1-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-03-11 00:50:27.620002

After the first round of Defense Department firings last week, the details of who was laid off — and why — are starting to emerge.
There are no rules to the game,” one of the fired probationary workers at the Defense Missile Agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, told Federal News Network.
The memo the Navy employee received upon his termination is almost identical to the one the Defense Health Agency sent out to its fired probationary employees.
After being sworn into office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to deploy a “next-generation missile defense shield” to protect the U.S. against aerial attacks.","When the Defense Department announced its plan to fire 5,400 probationary civilian employees, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized that poor performance would be the main factor in determining who would be let go, saying it was simply not in the public interest to keep workers “whose contributions are not mission critical.”

“Taxpayers deserve to have us take a really thorough look at our workforce top to bottom. Common sense would tell us where we should start. We start with poor performers amongst our probationary employees. We take a little bit more time to make sure, top to bottom, we’re doing a review. Those who we need, who are the best and brightest, are going to stay. Those who are under performers won’t. We’ll continue to shoot straight with you. We’ve got your back,” Hegseth said in a message to the force and the American public on Feb. 21.

After the first round of Defense Department firings last week, the details of who was laid off — and why — are starting to emerge. Federal News Network spoke with an employee who was let go one hour before his probation period was set to end, another employee who was not in a probationary status at all, and one employee who had just started a job in warfighter support operations.

“They are just indiscriminately firing people. There are no rules to the game,” one of the fired probationary workers at the Defense Missile Agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, told Federal News Network.

One Navy employee, whose name is also being withheld to protect against retaliation, was one hour away from the end of his probationary period before being terminated — unlike about a dozen probationary employees in the same role across the region who were given three weeks of administrative leave.

In a memo signed by Darin Selnick, who is performing the duties of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, the Navy said he “has not demonstrated that his further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.”

“What’s inequitable is that you can have 11 people, and ten of them go on three weeks administrative leave, which means that they have three weeks with a clearance that they can use to get another job. They’re getting paid. They have time to look for other jobs. I’m terminated that day. My leadership said it was discussed with the Department of Navy when they were trying to figure out how not to have to fire me. They said, “No, it happens today, because if he goes into another pay period, he’s no longer probationary, and we can’t fire him because he’s a protected veteran,” he said.

He also never received a formal performance review — he submitted self-assessments months ago, and his supervisor had completed their portion, but the commander had yet to sign off on it.

The memo the Navy employee received upon his termination is almost identical to the one the Defense Health Agency sent out to its fired probationary employees.

Firings at the Defense Health Agency

One of the fired DHA workers told Federal News Network she was not in a probationary status at all — she was hired at the beginning of 2023 as a GS-9, completed her probationary period in March 2024, and was promoted to GS-11 in August 2024.

The letter she got from HR congratulating her on her promotion last August never mentioned probationary time — her position description remained the same, but instead of assisting with certain tasks, she was now fully responsible for them.

When the DHA leadership received a list of people who were in a probationary status, she was notified her name was on the list. Her leadership got involved several times to clarify with HR that there was an error, but no action was ultimately taken to correct it.

During her time at DHA, she received an outstanding performance appraisal, along with time-off and monetary awards. But the memo she received, just like dozens of DHA workers fired that day, said that “based on your performance, you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.”

Defense Missile Agency layoffs

The Defense Missile Agency employee, who is a disabled veteran, had been with the organization since December — as a non-commissioned officer, he held a leadership role directly supporting the warfighters’ ability to do missile defense in theaters throughout the world.

He understood the mission intimately — the warfighters he provided support for as a civilian were the very same units he served in during his time in the military.

“I was a perfect fit for this job. I was doing really well. My supervisor was telling me I was doing really well, and if it was up to him, he would fight for me. But he was kept out of the conversation. It hurts me, because I worked extremely hard to get this position. I loved this job. The team I was on was the best team I was ever on. My supervisor was amazing, and I got fired for no reason whatsoever,” he said.

While many probationary employees were aware for some time they were on a list of those potentially facing termination, the DMA employee said there was no indication he would be laid off until he was in the HR office being told to sign documents and turn in his ID card. In fact, he was actively preparing to go on a work trip abroad prior to being fired that day.

He also never had a formal performance review — his mid-year evaluation was scheduled for the end of March.

“How are you going to let people go based off of performance if these people aren’t even being evaluated for performance? They have no indication of what their performance is other than the verbals from their supervisor. That’s not quantifiable,” he said.

The reason for his firing was to “further promote the efficiency of the federal service.”

“Even if they offer me my job back, I really don’t know if I would take it. I don’t want to subject myself or my family to that. I don’t want to put myself in a position where I could lose my job again,” he said.

After being sworn into office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to deploy a “next-generation missile defense shield” to protect the U.S. against aerial attacks. The agency was given 60 days to come with a plan for the Iron Dome for America — it is now seeking a wide range of advanced capabilities that would require significant investment, new technology, and infrastructure.

“They’re expecting to increase the funds later this summer because of the Iron Dome for America — we were expecting that the workload was going to get massive to support this. You’re not going to be able to get all that if you just slash the workforce, because you can’t fire everybody and then quadruple the work,” the fired DMA employee said.

It is unclear how many employees have been let go so far, or when the next round of firings will take place. The department said it was preparing to reduce its civilian workforce by 5-8%.

Hauschild, MPH, Defense Health Agency-Public Health Public Affairs

Legionnaires’ disease, a severe type of pneumonia, was so named in 1976 after a Pennsylvania outbreak of a mystery illness that sickened over 200 and killed 34 in two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the cause of the illness to be a particular type of bacteria. Legionella bacteria were discovered in the cooling towers of a hotel that had been used for an American Legion convention.

“The risk of Legionnaires’ disease is lower now that scientists have learned more about its cause and effective prevention tactics,” says Dr. Charles McCannon, a preventive medicine physician working for Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “While the risk is low, cases still occur.”

Outbreaks occur when two or more people are exposed to Legionella in the same place and get sick at about the same time, says McCannon. The last outbreak confirmed by the military was in 2010 at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan.

Medical monitoring for cases of communicable diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease is a public health measure that prevents larger-scale disease occurrence.

Tracking Cases in the Military

To identify potential outbreaks and prevent additional exposures to the hazardous bacteria, both the CDC and the U.S. military require medical facilities to report cases of Legionnaires’ disease.

Alexis Maule, a senior epidemiologist with the Preventive Medicine Division of DHA-PH at Aberdeen, explains that the name Legionellosis is now used to refer to both Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, a milder illness without pneumonia.

“Most people with Pontiac fever likely do not seek treatment for their illness,” says Maule. “In addition, most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria will not become ill with either Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever. That means the extent of exposure may underreported, but we are identifying cases needing treatment at military medical facilities.”

Even with the expanded case definition, the military has not found Legionellosis to be a commonly reported disease. This is generally consistent with CDC findings though there are higher rates in the general population.

“In the past five years, 87 Legionellosis cases have been reported to the military’s medical reporting system, and only half of these were confirmed to be Legionnaires’ disease,” says Maule. “In addition, the disease was most frequently reported in retirees, while less than a third of reported cases were active-duty military personnel.”

Maule explains that this makes sense because age is risk factor for Legionellosis, and many retirees were noted to already have chronic medical conditions unrelated to Legionellosis, making this group more susceptible to any type of bacterial infection.

McCannon and Maule provide answers to questions about Legionellosis:

Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What is Legionellosis?

Legionellosis comprises the illnesses (Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever) caused by the Legionella bacteria. Many species of Legionella bacteria can cause disease, but the presence of the bacteria in the environment or even in a clinical sample (such as urine or blood) does not mean a person is or will become ill with a disease. The majority of disease is caused by Legionella pneumophila, particularly a sub type known as serogroup 1.

Because the bacteria have the potential to cause harm (even if no clinical cases are reported), the presence of Legionella bacteria detected in a facility is considered a hazard to be remediated. Protocols have been established to ensure proper sanitation is achieved. (https://ph.health.mil/PHC Resource Library/ohs-ihf-control-of-legionella-factsheet.pdf)

Q. How does a person get sick with Legionnaires’ disease?

The primary way people are exposed is by breathing in water droplets that carry the Legionella bacteria. Less commonly, Legionella may be transmitted via aspiration of drinking water. Exposed persons who become sick do not transmit the infection to others.

While Legionella bacteria occur naturally in freshwater environments, they primarily cause disease after growing in certain human-made water systems that aerosolize water. Complex air conditioning cooling towers of large structures such as hotels, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and cruise ships are a particular concern. Water systems and air-conditioning units of private homes are generally not exposure sources. Cases have occasionally been attributed to personal hot tubs, whirlpool spas and even decorative fountains.

The CDC reports that since the 1976 outbreak, agencies around the world now have more stringent cleaning and hygiene standards for cooling towers and large-scale air-conditioning systems. But the conditions outside the U.S. may present more of a concern. (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/infographics/legionella-affects-water-systems.pdf)

Q. What are symptoms of Legionellosis?

Legionellosis symptoms can include fever and other flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches and cough and can begin hours to several days after bacteria are inhaled. Legionnaires’ disease symptoms begin two to 14 days after exposure and can be confirmed when Legionella bacteria infect cells in the air sacs of the lung. This condition can be life-threatening, but it is treatable with antibiotics.

The symptoms of Pontiac fever develop in five hours to a few days; it is a milder illness—without pneumonia—characterized by dry cough or sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue, headache and sore muscles.

Q. How is Legionellosis diagnosed?

Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, such as signs of pneumonia identified with a chest x-ray, and medical laboratory antigen confirmation of the unique type of the bacteria, known as serotype in the patient. If environmental samples are available, they can be compared to the bacteria type found in patient samples. If the bacteria type does not match the type found at an environmental source of concern, other exposure sources are considered.

Q. Are certain people at higher risk of Legionellosis?

Most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria do not get infected with disease. Certain behaviors such as smoking, recent travel with an overnight stay outside of the home, recent care at a healthcare facility, and hot tub use are risk factors that would be considered if determining a case.

The risk of Legionellosis is higher among persons over 50 and those with chronic lung disease, immune system disorders due to disease or medication, systemic malignancy, or an underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure. The younger, relatively healthy and vaccinated active-duty population has a lower risk for severe disease from Legionella exposure compared to the general population.

Q. Does risk of Legionellosis depend on location or time?

Within the U.S., the CDC has shown a higher number of cases of Legionellosis in the northern and mid-western states. There is some seasonality to the risk of Legionellosis, with higher risk of infection in the summer through fall months because temperate conditions allow for the growth of the bacteria. (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/php/surveillance/surveillance-report-2018-2019.html)

Q. How is Legionellosis differentiated from other pneumonias?

Pneumonia is a generalized term for inflammation and infection of the air sacs in one or both lungs resulting in fluid in the lungs. Air sacs fill with fluid or pus, causing a productive cough with phlegm, and often fever, chills and difficulty breathing.

Pneumonia can be a symptom of many different diseases and can be caused by a range of organisms, including bacteria (such as Legionnaires’ disease and Q fever), viruses (such as COVID-19 and certain flu viruses), and fungi (such as Coccidioidomycosis [“Valley fever”]). The severity of pneumonia infection can range from mild to life-threatening. Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe than viral pneumonia.

Pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria is only differentiated from other pneumonias by medical tests/laboratory tests to determine the cause of the pneumonia.

Q. Does the pneumonia vaccine help against Legionellosis?

There is no vaccine against Legionellosis, and none of the available pneumococcal vaccines protect against the Legionella bacteria. However, Legionnaires’ disease shares many of the same risk factors as other pneumonias, so getting a pneumococcal vaccine, as well as a respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccine, as recommended, may reduce the risk of severe Legionnaires’ disease.

Santa Clara, CAInjured veterans and advocates are fighting medical malpractice claims denied by the Defense Health Agency because they sustained injuries while on active duty, even though active duty also includes their time in hospital. They are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to end the 70-year-old 'unhinged and incoherent' Feres doctrine which blocks military members from bringing claims against the federal government. But on February 24, 2025 the Supreme Court issued a new blow to active duty service members hoping to seek justice following cases of alleged medical malpractice caused by military doctors, nurses and other healthcare practitioners.

Veteran Ryan Carter Denied

Maryland Air National Guard Veteran Ryan Carter underwent elective spinal surgery in 2018 – he was a healthy 43-year-old and not on active duty at the time. Carter couldn’t move his extremities when he woke from surgery; he had an MRI and was rushed back to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a second surgery to decompress his spinal canal. Carter is now a paraplegic.

Carter’s attorney filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to hear his case but said they were “stonewalled from the get-go” because his military status was deemed “active duty” while in hospital. Carter, his wife and his attorney also asked the Supreme Court have the Feres doctrine either clarified, limited or overruled and that the 1950 Feres decision by the Court contradicts the text and purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), wrongly denying military members orthodox legal remedies that Congress clearly opted to supply.

But that petition was just denied. Justice Clarence Thomas issued the only dissent opinion, saying he hoped one day the Supreme Court would overturn Feres, and that it has been almost universally condemned by judges and legal scholars. “Feres is indefensible as a matter of law, and senseless as a matter of policy,” Thomas wrote. “Had Carter been a veteran rather than an inactive reservist, he could have filed a lawsuit for the same injuries arising from the same treatment by the same military staff at the same hospital.”

Carter’s attorney told StarsandStripes.com that his case received support briefs filed by lawmakers and more than a dozen veterans organization. He will now turn his attention to an administrative claim that he filed on Carter’s behalf with the Defense Department.

Veteran Richard Stayskal Denied

An Army hospital failed to alert Green Beret Richard Stayskal to a large tumor they found on his lung in 2017. He didn’t know until months later from a doctor at a civilian hospital that he had stage 3 cancer. Military.com reported that Stayskal--after his diagnosis-- became an advocate for service members to file medical malpractice claims against the government--a process historically denied due to the Feres Doctrine (below).

Stayskal’s lung cancer changed military malpractice law and Congress created a new malpractice system called “The Sgt. First Class Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act”, which supposedly allows troops to file claims with the Defense Department alleging malpractice by military health-care providers, and allows veterans to seek damages for economic losses, pain and suffering. But it still didn’t help Stayskal.

Stayskal and his wife filed claims separately in 2021 for $20 million for pain and suffering. In 2023 his million medical malpractice claim was denied. His subsequent appeal also was denied.

“The denial of my claim by the Department of Defense, in my opinion, is a blatant act of betrayal. Not only to myself, but every service member out there,” Stayskal told StarsandStripes.com. “I stand here today on behalf of an entire generation and on behalf of future generations to ensure what happened to me will never happen again and give every breath I have for them.” Stayskal’s attorney said that “People have the right to sue if they are victims of malpractice, except for service members. It's time to stop treating them like second-class citizens. It's got to stop.” She went on. The Army told Stayskal it had ""breached standard of care"" but did not commit malpractice. The Army’s rejection letter said there was “no evidence that [Master Sgt.] Stayskal’s prognosis or chance of survival was adversely affected by the delay in the diagnosis of lung cancer.”

Stayskal, now with Stage 4 cancer, currently has no recourse to appeal his ruling. There is only one longshot: Congressman Darrell Issa and other House colleagues introduced a bill in 2023 called “The HERO Act” that would allow service members to take their medical malpractice claims to federal court. The bill has 27 sponsors but has not been considered by the House Judiciary Committee. According to Issa, “The HERO Act will grant service members who are victims of medical malpractice in a DOD medical treatment facility the right and opportunity to take their claim to District Court—the same legal process as military spouses, DOD civilians, and anyone else. It will finally reform the current failing system and replace it with one that gives our military the fair shot at justice they deserve.""

The Feres Doctrine

In a nutshell, the Feres Doctrine shields military doctors and the government from cases of alleged medical malpractice. The legal site Justia explains the Feres Doctrine: “The United States is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to members of the armed forces sustained while on active duty and not on furlough and resulting from the negligence of others in the armed forces.”

Troops still aren't allowed to file lawsuits over medical malpractice under the Feres Doctrine, set by a 1950 Supreme Court decision that protected the military and its officials from liability for combat-related injuries, although family members may file claims and lawsuits in civil court under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Aside from medical claims, the Feres doctrine has also limited the ability of people to bring military rape cases to civil courts.

In May 2024, Military.com reported that the Pentagon was “tweaking its formula for calculating payments to U.S. service members for medical malpractice claims, a move that could put more money in the pockets of affected troops and veterans. In October 2023, the amount of money for noneconomic damages rose from $600,000 to $750,000. Until 2021, service members were not allowed to file claims for medical malpractice or sue the Defense Department over injuries or illnesses that occur while on active duty. Stayskal and his wife both filed $20 million claims for pain and suffering, well over the current $750,000 cap for such claims. When Stayskal’s claim was denied, he told The Washington Post that Army Secretary Christine Wormuth offered him $600,000 using her discretionary funding authority, which was the maximum amount allowed for pain and suffering damages in the military's medical malpractice system. He refused the money.

On Friday (February 28), Crosland was forced to retire from her military role just a week after President Donald Trump fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officers, sources told Reuters.

Crosland’s retirement was publicly announced Friday, but Reuters reported that the senior officer was told she must resign.

“I want to thank Crosland for her dedication to the nation, to the military health system, and to Army medicine for the past 32 years,” Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in a statement Friday.

The sources, a current and former official, said Crosland wasn’t given a reason why she had to retire. The Pentagon also declined to provide a reason why Crosland allegedly resigned.

MPIR increased to 8.42% from 1st January 2025

The Maximum Permissible Interest Rate (MPIR) increased to 8.42% effective from January 1st 2025.

As facilities proceed to increase RAD’s, the lesser profitability of a concessional resident will result in a clear preference for RAD paying residents.

The effective Refundable Accommodation Contribution (RAC) on a refurbished aged care home, above the 40% concessional ratio, will be $302,671 from 1st January 2025, which will put pressure on those looking to find a concessional placement given average RAD’s are now much higher than this amount.

The hospital cited ""temporary staffing issues"" as the reason for the initially planned reduction in ER hours.

Support from the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine allowed the hospital to maintain its 24/7 ER service.

Naval Hospital Jacksonville will keep its emergency room running around the clock despite earlier statements that the ER’s schedule would be cut in half, the hospital announced over the weekend.

“Naval Hospital Jacksonville remains committed to providing exceptional care to our patients and ensuring access to the services they rely on,” read a Facebook message the hospital posted Saturday.

The message said the ER was staying open “through the support of the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine,” an enterprise created last year that includes the 154-year-old Navy Medical Corps comprised of 4,300 active-duty and reserve physicians. The Defense Health Agency oversees both civilian and military staffs at more than 700 military medical facilities.

The hospital at Naval Air Station Jacksonville had been scheduled to change Monday to ER hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. due to what Capt. Craig Malloy, its commanding officer, last week called “temporary staffing issues.”

The scaled-back hours had been projected to last into the summer.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.
“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt.
“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha.
“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander.","HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, New Mexico -- The 49th Medical Group is taking medical readiness training to the next level to enhance military medics’ ability to deliver lifesaving care on the battlefield.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.

“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt. Shelby Vande Zande, 49th Healthcare Operations Squadron primary care flight chief and the group’s alternate 4N functional manager. “That was ultimately the goal when setting up the program -- provide quality training and retention of skills.”

The Air Force launched the MEDIC-X program in 2024 to enhance medical Airmen’s ability to provide basic clinical support to warfighters. The program trains medics, including those not involved in patient care, such as administrators or laboratory technicians, to be proficient in 52 lifesaving skills spanning 13 clinical categories.

“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha. “Clinical providers and nurses may be limited on the battlefield; this initiative enhances our ability to deliver safe, high-quality care to our warfighters in any strategic environment.”

Incorporating a mix of classroom and hands-on training, Airmen practice skills such as IV fluid management, oxygen therapy, vital signs, dressing changes, and on- and off-loading patients from fixed-wing aircraft.

Rather than adhere to the traditional training modules and to enhance skills retention, the 49 MDG transformed training into a series of challenges with teams competing to earn the prestigious title of MEDIC-X Module Winner.

“At the inception of the training, we brainstormed the different ways that we could deliver the training that would result in a meaningful outcome while keeping the training interesting,” Vande Zande said.

Capt. Natasha Lindblom, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight commander, said creativity and fun were key to the brainstorming process. “If training is not engaging, it’s more easily forgotten,” she said.

One recent challenge tested Airmen’s ability to feed patients under challenging circumstances. The patient in the scenario wore “drunk glasses” to make their vision blurry, while a teammate fed the patient three spoons of pudding with the aim of not spilling a drop.

“It was great practice for situations where feeding a patient in distress may be needed,” Lindblom explained. “There was certainly a fair amount of pudding spilled.”

Another challenge tested Airmen’s ability to measure a patient’s fluid input and output, which is critical in ensuring fluid imbalance doesn’t impact patients’ stability. Using a chest atrium, foley bag, and syringe for output, as well as a cup of ice, glass of water, and unit of fake blood for input, the team had to measure fluid input and output, correspond the amounts to a number-to-letter chart, then spell out a word that unlocked a lock and revealed a small prize.

“All the while we had volunteers from the line side present yelling and making menacing sounds,” Lindblom said. “The challenge really got their adrenaline going. I was impressed at how many people remembered that 100 ml of ice is equal to 50 ml of fluid.”

“When we are in an austere environment performing these tasks, it will be stressful, and when people are stressed, they may make mistakes,” she added. “Practice is key to performing well under pressure.”

The winning teams receive a small prize, such as a hand-crocheted liver or gallbladder, courtesy of Lindblom. The prizes are small, but participants walk away with a sense of pride and achievement, she said.

The engaging format has received a positive reception, said Senior Airman Claire Pruitt, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight.

“Making MEDIC-X an enjoyable learning experience helps students stay more motivated, absorb the information more effectively, and develop the confidence needed to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios,” she said. “I love being able to see our hard work make others smile and keep them engaged in an ever-evolving field.”

MEDIC-X is beneficial not only for Airmen, but for the clinical providers on scene, Lindblom noted.

“If I can have non-clinical Airmen measuring inputs and outputs, then nurses can administer medications, hang IVs, do all of the things that nurses need to do,” she said. “Clinical personnel can focus on their tasks and the non-clinical Airmen can take care of the rest, especially when in a situation where prolonged field care is needed.”

Vande Zande said she saw the impact of the MEDIC-X program firsthand during a recent mass casualty exercise. “Our providers, nurses, and medical technicians were overrun with patients, and a lab tech and an admin tech stepped in to assist with providing ventilations and wound treatment to the patients,” she said. “Suddenly, our manpower team was far more than security and patient movement. Having the basic skills necessary to step in during an emergency is invaluable to the team as a whole and does nothing but benefit the patient.”

This collaborative approach strengthens teamwork and ensures Airmen are prepared for the unexpected.

“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander. “It enables clinical personnel to take care of casualties without having to worry about dividing their time and energies amongst many. It could be the difference between life and death for one of our warfighters.”

Harrell, one of the architects of the MEDIC-X program, praised the 49 MDG’s creative efforts to enhance medical readiness training.

“In a deployed setting, our medics will be called on to provide potentially lifesaving care and support, and they need to be able to do so confidently and deliberately,” Harrell said. “The 49 MDG’s innovative approach to MEDIC-X is a prime example of how leadership is harnessing ingenuity to ensure medical readiness and the delivery of exceptional care to our warfighters in any combat setting, no matter how austere or remote.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8905127/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-09 18:50:22.370749

Naval Hospital Sigonella Enhances Neonatal Resuscitation Training with Launch of Simulator,,,,,,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/492325/us-navy-medicine-readiness-and-training-command-u-s-naval-hospital-sigonella-enhances-neonatal-resuscitation-training-with-launch-simulator,"On February 12, 2025, the U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command (NMRTC) / Naval Hospital (NH) Sigonella celebrated the acquisition of the Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) simulator for the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP).
Mrs. Katia Arico, the command’s Staff Education and Training Coordinator and Trainer, led the year-long planning and procurement of the RQI for NRP Skills Station.
The winning name, NOAH—an acronym for Neonatal Outcomes And Healthcare—was chosen as a symbol of the hospital’s dedication to improving neonatal care through cutting-edge training technology.

The simulator, designed to replicate real-life neonatal resuscitation scenarios, enables healthcare providers to practice essential techniques, such as positive pressure ventilation, with real-time feedback.","On February 12, 2025, the U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command (NMRTC) / Naval Hospital (NH) Sigonella celebrated the acquisition of the Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) simulator for the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP). The addition of this advanced training tool underscores the hospital’s commitment to improving neonatal care and aligns with ongoing efforts by Navy Medicine and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to enhance medical readiness and patient outcomes. Mrs. Katia Arico, the command’s Staff Education and Training Coordinator and Trainer, led the year-long planning and procurement of the RQI for NRP Skills Station.

Hospital staff from across departments gathered for a lively celebration, themed as a baby shower, to mark the arrival of the innovative simulator. The event featured a range of activities, including games and prizes, with the staff actively participating in a poll to name the new neonatal manikin. The winning name, NOAH—an acronym for Neonatal Outcomes And Healthcare—was chosen as a symbol of the hospital’s dedication to improving neonatal care through cutting-edge training technology.

The new RQI simulator offers significant value to the hospital’s training program by helping healthcare providers maintain and improve their neonatal resuscitation skills. With NRP renewal training required every two years, the gap between training sessions can often lead to skill degradation. The use of simulation provides an effective solution to this challenge, enabling clinicians to repeatedly practice critical skills, sustain knowledge, and maintain proficiency.

The simulator, designed to replicate real-life neonatal resuscitation scenarios, enables healthcare providers to practice essential techniques, such as positive pressure ventilation, with real-time feedback. Key metrics, including mask seal, ventilation rate, and pressure, are monitored to guide improvements in clinical performance. The staff will utilize the simulator on a quarterly basis to practice the skills required to get newborn babies breathing in the critical first minutes after birth.

U.S. NMRTC/ NH Sigonella ensures maximum readiness by providing high-quality, safe patient and family-centered care to NATO and transient DoD forces in the U.S. Fifth Fleet and U.S. Sixth Fleet areas of operation and delivers an average of 50 babies per year. While the volume may be lower than larger hospitals, the importance of maintaining proficiency in high-risk neonatal scenarios remains paramount. The hospital’s healthcare professionals are called to manage neonatal resuscitations, which demand not only advanced knowledge but also immediate, precise action. “Our team is exceptional in providing care, but we know that high-risk scenarios, while rare, can be life-altering when they occur,” said Cmdr. (Dr.) Sebastian Lara, the sole Pediatrician at the hospital. “That’s why RQI for NRP is so important. It allows our staff to stay current with the latest neonatal resuscitation techniques and ensures that we are ready to respond effectively when it matters most.”

This initiative aligns with the Navy Surgeon General’s call for healthcare teams to remain agile and competent in a broad spectrum of clinical situations, even in low-volume settings. Lt. Cmdr. Brandi Gibson, the command’s NRP Program Director, shared her thoughts on the new system. “With such a low delivery volume, it’s easy to feel out of practice when we encounter a complicated birth. RQI has given our staff the ability to practice the most important neonatal resuscitation skills regularly, so when we do face a difficult situation, we are confident and ready to act.”

The hospital’s commitment to safety and readiness also aligns with the Navy’s broader mission of providing comprehensive healthcare services to military personnel and their families, no matter where they are stationed. In an environment where resources are sometimes limited and the stakes are high, maintaining a culture of excellence is essential. As Cmdr. Lara concluded, “We may not face a high volume of complicated deliveries, but when they do occur, we want to be ready. RQI for NRP ensures that we have the skills and knowledge to provide the best care possible and live up to the trust our patients place in us every day.”

The successful launch of the RQI for NRP program at U.S. NMRTC/NH Sigonella is a testament to the dedication of military medical personnel in upholding the highest standards of care, readiness, and patient safety. Through this initiative, the hospital continues to foster a culture of continuous improvement while ensuring that its staff is prepared for the most challenging and critical situations, both in peacetime and in the line of duty.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8904905/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-09 12:50:26.028265

Not only under the “well-child” criteria, but that’s these type of appointments fall under the category of preventative appts.
After getting in touch with the physician office I was told they couldn’t change it, and that I needed to speak to either billing or tricare.
After speaking with tricare they agreed with my train of thought but wanted to transfer me to their claims department.
Somebody, for the love of god.. please point me in the right direction for how I can resolve this.","Recently PCSd out west transferring over to tricare west. For my 2 kids that are in the 0-6 years old “well-child” criteria of tricare I assumed that all routine check ups for IE) 6mo 12mo, etc. check ups would be fully covered. Not only under the “well-child” criteria, but that’s these type of appointments fall under the category of preventative appts. Several weeks after the appointments both on the same day for both children; we were sent a bill in the mail for the appointment that needed to be paid. I was sent through the witch-hunt. After calling the clinic they transferred me to the billing department multiple times where they said the appointment was mis-coded by the physician and should’ve been coded as a preventative and that I could only change it by speaking with the physician for them to do an amendment to the visit to recode. After getting in touch with the physician office I was told they couldn’t change it, and that I needed to speak to either billing or tricare. Talking to someone different in billing a 3rd/4th time I was told that the EOB for coverage covered the visit but not “technical fee” also known as a facility fee. After speaking with tricare they agreed with my train of thought but wanted to transfer me to their claims department. After 4 attempts of getting in touch their claims department, being on hold for over an hour each time and requesting a call back I was unsuccessful in ever getting in touch with the claims department. Seems impossible. It is my perception that on tricare select with my kids being under 6yo doing routine “preventative” checkups, as well as “well-child” that I shouldn’t be paying anything out of pocket for these appointments. So now I’m sitting here with a $240 bill for a single checkup, many more appointments to come for them as they hit milestones of routine checkups for under 1yo. In search of any way to resolve this or what my next actions should be to fix this issue. I’m an active duty service member, have been in for quite a while, I’m on my 6th duty station and chose to pay a little extra for my beneficiaries to be on select so they wouldn’t have to deal with lack of competence and extreme levels of unprofessionalism we’ve experienced on post time and time again. It seems absurd to me that me as customer has to call numerous times from office to office for them to just tell me that it’s a different person that’s responsible for the billing mistakes.
