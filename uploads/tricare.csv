“We must shape the next 20 years with national security and the National Health Insurance Authority, ensuring that our forces are covered by national health and well-being safeguards for service members, their families, and eligible civilians—extending across postings and into retirement,” he said.
The minister further explained that the health of the military was directly tied to national security, noting that preventive healthcare and insurance coverage would ensure operational readiness.
Matawalle emphasised that integrating the armed forces into health insurance would not only sustain care but also safeguard long-term national security.
Matawalle said the figures are a testament to the importance of integrating military personnel into health insurance coverage, which would guarantee not only the sustainability of care but also long-term operational effectiveness.","The Federal Government has announced plans to fully enrol members of the Nigerian Armed Forces into the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), ensuring proper integration and access to comprehensive healthcare for service members, their families, and eligible retirees.

Minister of State for Defence, Bello Matawalle, disclosed this on Tuesday while speaking in Abuja during the 20th anniversary celebration of the Ministry of Defence Health Implementation Programme’s partnership with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Africa.

Matawalle expressed that the initiative would strengthen Nigeria’s defence health system and guarantee that soldiers and their families enjoy the same health safeguards as other citizens under the NHIA.

“We must shape the next 20 years with national security and the National Health Insurance Authority, ensuring that our forces are covered by national health and well-being safeguards for service members, their families, and eligible civilians—extending across postings and into retirement,” he said.

The minister further explained that the health of the military was directly tied to national security, noting that preventive healthcare and insurance coverage would ensure operational readiness.

“The health of our armed forces is preserved for the security of our nation. When illness is prevented, protection and unity remain operational missions,” he added.

Citing the impact of the defence health partnership, Matawalle explained that it has already benefitted over half a million Nigerians, including military and civilians, saving lives, strengthening infrastructure, and boosting confidence in military-led healthcare.

Matawalle emphasised that integrating the armed forces into health insurance would not only sustain care but also safeguard long-term national security.

“As we mark this anniversary, we renew our collective resolve to keep the health of our armed forces at the heart of national defence,” he said.

Chief of Defence Staff, General Christopher Musa, described the NHIA integration as a crucial step toward ensuring soldiers remain fit to defend the nation.

He hailed the two-decade partnership with Walter Reed as a model of international collaboration, which has transformed Nigeria’s military health system, strengthened 32 health facilities nationwide, and supported civilian communities during health crises, including HIV prevention and COVID-19 response.

Musa cited the Defence Reference Laboratory in Abuja, which was accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation, describing it as a landmark facility that enhanced Nigeria’s capacity to respond to future health threats.

Also at the event, the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Richard Mills Jr., commended the partnership as a demonstration of trust and respect between Nigeria and the U.S., while Major General Paula Lodi, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, said the collaboration had saved countless lives, built local capacity, and influenced health policy beyond Nigeria.

Since its inception, the programme has recorded significant milestones. A total of 1,628,414 clients have been tested and counselled for HIV, out of which 110,097 tested positive. About 69,447 adults and children have been newly initiated on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), with 40,702 currently on treatment. In all, 77,162 adults and children have ever been enrolled on ART.

In addition, 277,975 pregnant women now know their HIV status, 15,098 of them tested positive, and 13,377 received ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the disease.

Matawalle said the figures are a testament to the importance of integrating military personnel into health insurance coverage, which would guarantee not only the sustainability of care but also long-term operational effectiveness.

“As we mark this anniversary, we renew our collective resolve to keep the health of our armed forces at the heart of national defence. The force that guarantees peace is resilience and mission orientation. Let us commit to leaving behind a defence health system that is not only robust, but innovative, intensive, and spiritually prepared for future threats, while safeguarding the well-being of the men and women who serve our country,” the minister declared.",https://www.tvcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/132192633_222624589474829_6305451687429302733_n-e1621599627658.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-24 10:56:26.543231

Veterans, warfighters, and first responders deserve care that is personal, trusted, and close to home, delivered through sustainable systems that are built to last.
About LUKE LUKE is a trusted leader in healthcare staffing for the U.S. Government.","NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the American Association of Christian Counselors (AACC) World Conference in Nashville opens, LUKE Holdings, Inc. (“LUKE”), a trusted leader in healthcare staffing for the U.S. Government, is extending an invitation to churches, ministries, and community organizations across the country to join in a shared effort to strengthen care for America’s heroes.

Our nation is blessed with veterans, warfighters, and first responders who protect our communities and keep us safe. Yet today, many of these heroes and their families are carrying heavy burdens. Every day, 17 veterans die by suicide. In 2023 alone, 523 warfighters took their own lives. More law enforcement officers and firefighters now die from suicide than in the line of duty. That is a tragedy we cannot accept, and it is why we must bring hope before despair takes hold.

“For more than twenty years, LUKE has served alongside the federal government to deliver healthcare for those who protect our nation,” said John Sanders, CEO of LUKE. “We know that true flourishing requires more than clinical services alone. It takes professional care working in concert with the trusted networks that we know people turn to first, including churches and community organizations. When we build structured partnerships, we surround our heroes with strength, restore resilience, and create sustainable support systems that ensure they are never left to carry their burdens in silence.”

When people are struggling, the first place most turn is their place of worship. That trust is powerful. Faith and community support have already been shown to lower suicide, reduce hospital stays, and bring real hope and healing. The scale of the crisis demands a broader response, one that draws on both professional care and trusted community networks. Veterans, warfighters, and first responders deserve care that is personal, trusted, and close to home, delivered through sustainable systems that are built to last.

“This is a defining moment,” Sanders added. “When organizations and communities unite around a mission bigger than themselves, we not only honor sacrifice but also deliver real-world solutions that restore strength and rebuild lives.”

In conjunction with the event, LUKE has launched a Human Flourishing page on its website, offering a starting point for churches and organizations ready to engage in this effort: https://lukestaffing.com/humanflourishing/.

At Kemah Palms Recovery, we’re proud to be an in-network provider, so you can focus on healing instead of paperwork. This guide explains how your Tricare plan supports outpatient treatment, what services are included, and how to verify benefits before you begin.

Understand Tricare coverage

Covered treatment options

Tricare offers comprehensive coverage for addiction treatment, from detoxification through ongoing outpatient care. According to TricareRehabs, you can expect benefits for services such as detox, inpatient rehab, intensive outpatient programs, therapy sessions, and long-term recovery support [1].

Service Description Coverage highlights Detoxification Medically supervised withdrawal from drugs or alcohol Inpatient and outpatient detox covered Inpatient rehabilitation 24/7 care in a residential setting Full or partial coverage depending on plan Intensive outpatient program (IOP) Structured therapy several times per week Covered if medically necessary Partial hospitalization program (PHP) Day treatment with group and individual therapy Coverage varies by medical necessity and plan limits Therapy and counseling Individual, group, and family sessions Covered under mental health benefits Long-term outpatient support Aftercare groups and relapse prevention Covered when prescribed by a provider

Coverage exclusions and limits

Tricare only covers services that are medically or psychologically necessary for diagnosis or treatment of a covered condition. Services deemed custodial care or non-skilled (for example, basic exercise without skilled oversight) are excluded [2]. Additionally, some programs may have special rules or limits, so always confirm with your plan administrator.

Check your benefits

Identify your Tricare plan

Your coverage depends on whether you have Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, or another Tricare option. Prime often requires a referral from your primary care manager (PCM) but has lower out-of-pocket costs. Select gives you more flexibility in choosing providers but may involve higher copayments and deductibles.

Review plan details

Locate your benefits handbook or log in to the TRICARE East or West portal to see specific outpatient rehab coverage. If you’re in the East region, check alcohol detox details at alcohol detox tricare east coverage. If you’re in the West region, see drug detox options at drug detox tricare west coverage. Always verify your plan’s criteria for inpatient and outpatient services.

Confirm outpatient services

Intensive outpatient programs

An intensive outpatient program (IOP) provides several hours of therapy per day while you live at home. Tricare covers IOPs when a provider documents medical necessity. These programs often include group therapy, individual counseling, and educational sessions.

Partial hospitalization programs

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) offer daylong treatment without an overnight stay. PHPs blend clinical structure with community support, and Tricare may cover this level of care if less restrictive options are insufficient.

Therapy and support groups

Tricare covers individual, group, and family counseling for substance use and co-occurring mental health issues. These sessions help you develop coping skills and build a relapse prevention plan.

Navigate authorization process

Obtain preauthorization

Most outpatient services require preauthorization from your regional contractor—Humana Military in the East, TriWest in the West. Your provider will submit a treatment plan and request approval. Authorization ensures that your care is covered and that you avoid unexpected bills.

Gather necessary documentation

To speed up approval, have the following ready:

Referral or prescription from your PCM

Clinical assessment or intake evaluation

Provider’s treatment plan detailing frequency and duration

Manage out-of-pocket costs

Copayments and deductibles

Your share of cost varies by plan. Under Tricare Prime, you may pay minimal copays for outpatient visits. Under Tricare Select, expect a deductible plus a percentage of the allowable charge. In-network providers keep your expenses predictable with negotiated rates.

In-network vs out-of-network

Choosing an in-network facility like Kemah Palms Recovery minimizes your costs. Out-of-network care may still be covered but often at a lower benefit rate, leaving you responsible for a larger portion of the bill.

Access support services

Individual and group therapy

Counseling is a cornerstone of lasting recovery. Tricare covers behavioral therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and family counseling when they are part of your prescribed treatment plan.

Home health care

For those who need support at home, Tricare may cover home health visits and pharmacy home delivery services to ensure continuity of care [3]. These resources help you maintain stability as you transition back to daily life.

Next steps and resources

Reach out to Kemah Palms Recovery’s admissions team to verify your coverage, initiate preauthorization, and schedule your first appointment. We handle insurance verification so you can focus on your recovery.

Janelle Marra finds herself at the center of an unfolding controversy that has drawn national attention after her removal from leadership positions and an ongoing investigation concerning her LinkedIn profile. Unbeknownst to her family, this development follows an orchestrated online campaign aimed at ousting her, rooted in hostility toward her advocacy for LGBTQ+ healthcare.

Marra, a doctor with extensive experience at Camp Pendleton and the Naval Medical Center San Diego, has been recognized for her contributions, particularly in women’s and LGBTQ+ health. Her role as the medical services director for Expeditionary Medical Facility 150 Bravo placed her in a pivotal position, and she was even nominated by Navy Surgeon General D.K. Via to serve as the deputy medical director of the Defense Health Agency’s Transgender Health Center. Despite concerted efforts to provide care, her work persisted during a tumultuous political climate where a transgender military ban was enacted under the Trump administration.

The situation escalated when podcaster Chase Spears shared a screenshot of Marra’s LinkedIn page on social media, highlighting her emphasis on LGBTQ+ and transgender healthcare. This post caught the attention of the controversial account Libs of Tik Tok, which frequently spreads anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. Following the account’s amplification of Spears’ post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth responded with a caustic remark, which further fueled the backlash against Marra.

As a result of this online exposure, Marra and her family began receiving a surge of threatening messages, some of which included violent comments suggesting execution by firing squad. With the threats escalating in severity, local law enforcement was involved to ensure the family’s safety, highlighting the real-world ramifications of online harassment campaigns.

Cassandra Marra, Janelle’s wife and a community college professor, expressed the distress this has caused their family, including their two children, one of whom is diagnosed with autism. The couple are currently grappling with anxiety and depression due to the situation, along with concerns about their financial stability, should the investigation lead to Janelle’s termination.

Communicating the emotional toll the harassment has taken, Cassandra stated that the consequences of the online attack are significantly more draining than the accusations themselves. She fears not just for their safety but also for their livelihood, as the loss of Janelle’s position would jeopardize their health insurance and pension accrued over her 17-year career.

Two weeks after the Libs of Tik Tok post, it amassed nearly 11 million views, spurring discussions about the impact of social media on professional lives. Cassandra emphasized that Janelle’s situation, while currently unique in its visibility, is not isolated, as others have faced similar fates without the intense scrutiny.

Highlighting the broader implications, she underscored the need for public discourse on the consequences of allowing such campaigns to succeed, stressing that silence could set a dangerous precedent for military personnel and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Navy-Doctor-Targeted-by-Online-Harassment-Campaign-Over-LinkedIn-Profile.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-24 02:56:20.372679

""We encourage patients to complete the survey; their feedback is invaluable,” he said.","JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO, Texas – Patients have ranked 18 Defense Health Network Central clinics, providers and support staff as the ""best of the best"" in the Military Health System for patient experience and customer care, according to a recent Joint Outpatient Experience Survey, or JOES, quarterly report.

""Through quarterly ‘Best of the Best’ reports – informed by JOES data and beneficiary feedback – we recognize our clinics and personnel for delivering outstanding patient experiences, fostering a culture of exceptional care across the Military Health System,"" said Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, DHN Central director and Medical Readiness Command Alpha commander. “The dedication of these teams to providing outstanding care is truly inspiring, and I am incredibly proud of their commitment to our beneficiaries and their relentless pursuit of excellence.”

Each quarter, the Military Health System uses JOES data, which measures patient experience and satisfaction during outpatient appointments, to generate a ""best of the best"" report. The survey requests feedback on multiple aspects of the visit, including appointment timeliness, the helpfulness of front desk personnel, provider trust and communication, medical history, access to care, and overall satisfaction with the visit.

The report highlights the enterprise's top-performing military medical clinics, providers, and clerical staff in both primary and specialty care. Notably, Brooke Army Medical Center’s Peripheral Vascular Surgery Clinic took the No. 1 ranking in the specialty care category, while Fairchild Air Force Base’s Pediatric Clinic achieved the top spot in primary care.

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families.
“The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties.
That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.” DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership.","Becoming a high-reliability organization, or HRO, is a major goal for complex health systems. Achieving this goal means focusing on safety and minimizing errors across all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics. It also requires strong, active leadership.

“Our strong focus on high reliability is more than just a clinical aim; it’s a critical mission,” said Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer of DHA Dr. Paul Cordts. “It starts and ends with our leaders. We must show our commitment to zero preventable harm and build a culture where safety is everyone’s personal duty.”

How leaders build a culture of high reliability

In HROs, leaders make safety a top priority. They support continuous learning and push for innovation and growth. They create a shared vision for safer care, and they take personal responsibility for shaping the work culture. So, what does this look like in practice?

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families. Strong, caring leadership builds trust and contributes to a culture of safety. It gives our front-line staff the confidence to speak up and make changes that can save lives,” DHA Chief Nursing Officer Dr. Kristen Atterbury explained.

Leaders foster this kind of culture through clear and consistent actions. They follow key habits and values, including:

Modeling principles: Demonstrate ready, reliable care principles in how you approach your daily work.

Integrating safety and quality: Make safety and quality part of every task and goal.

Fostering trust: Build trust by being open, listening closely, and giving honest feedback.

Championing a just culture: Support a fair system where people are held accountable in a balanced way.

Leveraging expertise: Use everyone’s skills and knowledge, no matter their role or rank.

Ensuring psychological safety: Make sure staff know they can speak up about risks without fear of punishment.

Empowering through resources: Give people the tools and training they need to improve how they work.

Celebrating progress: Set up ways to thank staff and celebrate their success.

Fostering a supportive environment: Create a workplace where people grow, and teams do their best work.

These habits help turn big ideas into daily actions. That’s essential for any organization working to become a true HRO. “The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties. That’s OK,” said DHA Chief Dental Officer Air Force Col. (Dr.) Donald Sheets. “What matters is that we share one vision — from our top leaders to our newest staff. That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.”

DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership. By following the ready, reliable care principles, building trust, empowering teams, and keeping safety at the center, leaders help turn goals into real, lasting change. And that work leads us closer to one clear, critical goal: zero preventable harm across all care settings.",https://www.dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9322051.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-24 09:56:29.720817

This partnership aims to accelerate modernization research and development efforts across military medicine.

This strategic partnership, led by DHA’s Research and Engineering Directorate, positions VelocityTX as a trusted operational hub for translational science, agile infrastructure deployment, and cross-sector collaboration. The agreement consolidates existing independent research and development efforts — including those with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research and the 59th Medical Wing — under a unified, mission-aligned framework.

Structured under the Federal Technology Transfer Act, the agreement sets forth three primary assurances:

• Intellectual property safeguards: robust protections for all parties, while preserving government purpose rights

• Modular collaboration pathways: scalable sub-agreements enable adaptive deployments across regions

• HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant integration: ethical and secure frameworks for future research operations

“This agreement transforms how military medicine innovates,” said Dr. Diana del Mónaco, DHA’s Regional Research Support Center project lead. “It unlocks the governance, intellectual property safeguards, and translational agility needed to drive mission-focused results at scale.”

San Antonio: A strategic nexus for military medicine

Known as “Military City, USA,” San Antonio is home to Joint Base San Antonio — comprised of Lackland Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, and Randolph Air Force Base — and Brooke Army Medical Center, the Department of Defense’s only Level I trauma center. VelocityTX’s proximity to these institutions enables seamless collaboration between military and civilian research ecosystems.

""San Antonio has long been at the forefront of military medical research, with an unmatched concentration of expertise, infrastructure, and mission-driven collaboration,"" said Rene Dominguez, chief executive officer of VelocityTX. ""This agreement builds on that legacy by connecting our city’s world-class military medical assets with cutting-edge private sector innovation to address critical capability gaps. Together with DHA, we are creating a pathway to rapidly translate new discoveries into solutions that strengthen warfighter readiness and improve care for military families and civilians alike.""

Enhancing partnerships, accelerating innovation

In May 2025, the two agencies hosted the second annual Promoting Professional Engagement Among Military Medical Laboratories, or ProPEL, at the VelocityTX campus. They also worked together on the AIM Health R&D Summit, which convenes military, academic, and industry leaders from across the country to share research and explore opportunities for collaboration.

“Events like ProPEL and AIM enhance research collaborations and synergy between the public and private sectors,” said del Mónaco. “By leveraging the scientific ecosystems VelocityTX is building in the Innovation District of San Antonio, military medical researchers are able to drive advancements and health care solutions aligned with DHA priorities with the ultimate goal of enabling warfighter and military family readiness, catalyze dual-use innovations, and reinforce DHA’s commitment to real-time, real-world readiness.”

The DHA Research and Engineering Directorate leads the discovery of innovative medical solutions responsive to the needs of combatant commands, the military services, and the Military Health System.

“There’s no rhyme or reason for any of this, other than just straight up hate,” Cassandra Marra said.
Janelle Marra also came to specialize in women’s and LGBTQ+ healthcare, and was nominated by Navy Surgeon General D.K.
“I’m sure that there are people trying to ensure that we don’t have our kids anymore,” Cassandra Marra said.
She has been removed from all her leadership roles and is still seeing patients while under investigation for violating social media rules.","When U.S. Navy Cmdr. Janelle Marra was removed from her Navy leadership roles and put under investigation for her LinkedIn page, her family did not know she was already the target of an online campaign to get her fired.

When Janelle Marra called her wife, community college biology professor Cassandra Marra, with the news, they were confused. Was everyone’s LinkedIn pages being surveilled or just hers?

“There’s no rhyme or reason for any of this, other than just straight up hate,” Cassandra Marra said. Janelle Marra could not speak to the press while under investigation.

The anatomy of an online harassment campaign

Janelle Marra, a doctor, has worked at Camp Pendleton clinics and the Naval Medical Center San Diego in Balboa Park on and off since 2008. She became medical services director of Expeditionary Medical Facility 150 Bravo, a Navy unit in San Diego trained to provide medical care to support military operations, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Janelle Marra also came to specialize in women’s and LGBTQ+ healthcare, and was nominated by Navy Surgeon General D.K. Via to serve as deputy medical director of the short-lived Defense Health Agency (DHA) Transgender Health Center (TGHC). Via praised her as a great asset to both DHA and Navy medicine in a nomination letter shared with Times of San Diego.

As she began attending meetings and taking virtual patients, Janelle Marra’s LinkedIn page reflected her role.

The Trump administration enacted a transgender military ban to start the year, but never formally dissolved the center.

“She did the job for a year and a half,” Cassandra Marra said. “She did that job. They never got around to giving her a formal recognition of the job, because it fairly quickly became the turnaround between presidents and they also never told her to not do the job. So she was in this position where she was like, ‘Okay, I’m just going to keep doing this job that they told me that I needed to do.’”

That came to the attention of podcaster Chase Spears, who posted a screenshot of Janelle Marra’s LinkedIn page to X on Sept. 4 with the caption, “DEI isn’t fully dead yet.” He highlighted her focus on LGBTQ+ and transgender healthcare, and the fact she filled out the pronouns field on the social media site. In her profile picture, she is in uniform, and her cover photo is of a Pride flag.

Popular right-wing account Libs of Tik Tok picked up the post, tagging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The Libs of Tik Tok account regularly posts anti-LGBTQ+ messages, and frequently share the social media handles, name and identifying information of LGBTQ+ people who then face threats and harassment from the account’s followers.

Within the day, Hegseth reposted the Libs of Tik Tok post, with the quip, “Pronouns UPDATED: She/Her/Fired.”

Online threats spill over into real world

Soon, death threats started rolling in. Among them, the 17-year active duty Navy doctor was told she should be executed by firing squad. The threats were credible enough the military insisted the family report them to the county sheriff to get extra patrols on their street.

Family photos surfaced with their two children. The gay parents were accused of being groomers and pedophiles.

“I’m sure that there are people trying to ensure that we don’t have our kids anymore,” Cassandra Marra said. “That’s one of my greatest fears; my children are my everything.”

The couple has experienced anxiety and depression in the two weeks since the post and leadership change. They have trouble sleeping amid the death threats. Their 7-year-old son is upset about the situation despite not being able to fully comprehend it.

Janelle Marra has not been fired yet. She has been removed from all her leadership roles and is still seeing patients while under investigation for violating social media rules.

Cassandra Marra said she long ago learned to ignore homophobia, but the family would be in financial trouble if her wife is fired. They would lose health insurance for their children, who are diagnosed with autism, and possibly the pension her wife has earned during her 17-year career.

“The real world consequences are definitely much more draining on you than the people accusing you of something,” Cassandra Marra said,

Two weeks later, the Libs of Tik Tok post has nearly 11 million views, thousands of likes and reposts, and hundreds of comments.

“She’s not the first person that this was done to,” Cassandra Marra said “She’s just the first person that has had it so public and so loud. There have been other people removed from their positions.”

She fears the implications if the public tolerates a Naval officer being fired over a social media campaign.

“I love my country and I want better for it,” Cassandra Marra said. “And if nobody speaks out, if nobody says this is wrong, then we’re never going to go in the direction that we need to go.”",https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Naval-Medical-Center-San-Diego.jpg?fit=720%2C540&ssl=1,N,0.0,2025-09-23 11:56:23.372238

Omnicare filed more than 3.3 million false claims between 2010 and 2018, in violation of the False Claims Act, according to court documents.
The Chapter 11 agreement is for $110 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing.

A federal judge in July determined that Omnicare had illegally charged the U.S. government for prescription drugs and ordered it to pay more than $948 million in damages and penalties. Omnicare filed more than 3.3 million false claims between 2010 and 2018, in violation of the False Claims Act, according to court documents.

The original lawsuit had been filed by a former Omnicare pharmacist, who had accused the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid and the Tricare military program for more than $135 million in drugs that weren’t covered.

The Chapter 11 agreement is for $110 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing. Once the court gives the go-ahead, the company expects the financing to provide enough liquidity for it to meet its ongoing business obligations during the process.

Omnicare said it will use the Chapter 11 process to address other financial challenges facing the long-term care pharmacy industry and will potentially mull restructuring options. That could include anything from standalone restructuring to outright sale.

The company said it will seek authorization from the court to continue its operations during the Chapter 11 proceedings. To that end, it said it would meet its commitment to stakeholders, including continuing to pay for employee wages and benefits.

Omnicare said it also expects to pay vendors and suppliers in full, under normal terms, for goods and services.",http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/hfn/files/2025-09/lawsuit_legal_lawyers_judge_fraud_Pichsakul%20Promrungsee_%20EyeEm_Getty%20Images_5_0.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-23 11:56:34.263589

Omnicare is estimated to have between 200 and 999 creditors.

Omnicare has arranged $110 million of debtor-in-possession financing, which the company’s leaders expect will provide “sufficient liquidity” to stay in business, according to a press release. Omnicare has also asked the court to continue operations throughout its bankruptcy process, including paying employee wages and benefits.

“During the court-supervised process, Omnicare is continuing to provide safe and reliable pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. Omnicare customers and patients can expect to continue to access pharmacy and clinical services without disruption,” a representative for Omnicare said in a statement to Senior Housing News Monday.

Omnicare declined to comment on how many customers it has.

The company’s chapter 11 filing is linked to recent litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In April, Omnicare was found liable for improperly billing the United States government, resulting in $135 million in damages in “one of the largest damages verdicts rendered by a jury in a False Claims Act case,” according to the U.S. Dept. of Justice.

Omnicare was found to have distributed drugs that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law between 2010 and 2018 and billed Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. In July, a judge ordered Omnicare to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages.

David Azzolina, president of Omnicare, said the district court imposed “an extreme and … unconstitutional penalty.”

“Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,” Azzolina said. “There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it.”

The chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and related cases are just the latest setbacks for the long-term care pharmacy. In 2022, CVS noted that its long-term care services business line “was no longer a strategic asset” and the company explored selling it. But the company halted its sale exploration in 2023 after determining the pharmacy’s value to CVS exceeded what the company would get in a sale.",https://seniorhousingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/SHN-Facebook-Share-Size.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-23 13:56:19.323575

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families.
“The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties.
That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.” DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership.","Becoming a high-reliability organization, or HRO, is a major goal for complex health systems. Achieving this goal means focusing on safety and minimizing errors across all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics. It also requires strong, active leadership.

“Our strong focus on high reliability is more than just a clinical aim; it’s a critical mission,” said Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer of DHA Dr. Paul Cordts. “It starts and ends with our leaders. We must show our commitment to zero preventable harm and build a culture where safety is everyone’s personal duty.”

How leaders build a culture of high reliability

In HROs, leaders make safety a top priority. They support continuous learning and push for innovation and growth. They create a shared vision for safer care, and they take personal responsibility for shaping the work culture. So, what does this look like in practice?

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families. Strong, caring leadership builds trust and contributes to a culture of safety. It gives our front-line staff the confidence to speak up and make changes that can save lives,” DHA Chief Nursing Officer Dr. Kristen Atterbury explained.

Leaders foster this kind of culture through clear and consistent actions. They follow key habits and values, including:

• Modeling principles: Demonstrate ready, reliable care principles in how you approach your daily work.

• Integrating safety and quality: Make safety and quality part of every task and goal.

• Fostering trust: Build trust by being open, listening closely, and giving honest feedback.

• Championing a just culture: Support a fair system where people are held accountable in a balanced way.

• Leveraging expertise: Use everyone’s skills and knowledge, no matter their role or rank.

• Ensuring psychological safety: Make sure staff know they can speak up about risks without fear of punishment.

• Empowering through resources: Give people the tools and training they need to improve how they work.

• Celebrating progress: Set up ways to thank staff and celebrate their success.

• Fostering a supportive environment: Create a workplace where people grow, and teams do their best work.

These habits help turn big ideas into daily actions. That’s essential for any organization working to become a true HRO.

“The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties. That’s OK,” said DHA Chief Dental Officer Air Force Col. (Dr.) Donald Sheets. “What matters is that we share one vision — from our top leaders to our newest staff. That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.”

DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership. By following the ready, reliable care principles, building trust, empowering teams, and keeping safety at the center, leaders help turn goals into real, lasting change. And that work leads us closer to one clear, critical goal: zero preventable harm across all care settings.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9322051/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 16:56:18.431532

The delegation included TAMC Commander, Col. William Bimson, U.S. Army; U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Surgeon Capt. Peter Roberts, U.S. Navy; and Surgeon Vice Adm. Arti Sarin, Indian Navy; along with other staff members.

The tour provided a comprehensive overview of the hospital’s medical training programs, showcasing the full spectrum of medical education and operational capabilities at TAMC. The engagement aims to foster interoperability and build a stronger foundation for future U.S.-India collaboration in military healthcare.

The tour began with a historical overview of TAMC, featuring photographs of its construction and development. The delegation then visited the Ruth Andrews Simulation Center, where staff showcased the facility and discussed the medical competency assessment program and general medical education capstone requirements. These programs effectively train soldiers and prepare them for deployment by emphasizing realistic scenario-based training, advanced medical techniques, and a focus on adaptability in deployed environments.

Discussions also highlighted the challenges and successes of transitioning a peacetime healthcare system to a wartime footing. As explained by U.S. Army Col. Mitchell Hamele, Deputy Director of Academics, Research, and Training, and U.S. Army Lt. Col. Zachary Bevis, Program Director of the Tripler Family Medicine Residency, “We were able to share both challenges and areas of success in preparing a peacetime healthcare system to be able to rapidly transition to wartime footing with medical personnel trained to operate above their peacetime skill set in resource-limited environments.”

The delegation also toured the Brace Shop (Orthotics and Prosthetic Services), learning about the care provided to Soldiers and their families. They received an overview of the Interdisciplinary Pain Management Center (IPMC) and its innovative approach to managing pain and care techniques.

During lunch, the delegation discussed the Certified Nurse Transition Program (CNTP) and its contribution to Army readiness. Further discussion centered on TAMC’s role as a key medical asset supporting joint operations in the Indo-Pacific region, and TAMC’s integration within the Defense Health Agency’s standardized systems for medical care, resource management, and ultimately, strengthening the Military Health System.

The visit to TAMC concluded a comprehensive, multi-site engagement for the Indian delegation, offering a broad overview of U.S. military medical capabilities. The delegation’s tour encompassed key installations across the Indo-Pacific region and the continental United States. Further engagements in Washington, D.C., included visits to Health Affairs, Defense Health Agency, Uniformed Services University, and Walter Reed Institute of Research.

The comprehensive tour provided a holistic view of U.S. military medical capabilities, fostering valuable discussions on best practices, interoperability, and opportunities for strengthened collaboration between the two nations’ medical forces.

TAMC serves as the Department of Defense’s premier medical center in the Pacific Basin, providing comprehensive tertiary care to a diverse and geographically dispersed population. This includes over 264,000 local active duty and retired military personnel, their families, and veteran beneficiaries. TAMC also extends its medical expertise to a regional population of 171,000, encompassing personnel from nine U.S. affiliated jurisdictions and forward-deployed forces across more than 40 countries in the Indo-Pacific region.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9331692/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 14:56:25.090151

Matter of: Defense Health Agency—Payment of Conference Costs under a Continuing Resolution

File: B-336934

Date: September 22, 2025

DIGEST

A certifying officer asks whether the Defense Health Agency (DHA) could use amounts appropriated to its Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriations account under a continuing resolution to cover the registration costs of a training event held after the continuing resolution’s end date. The continuing resolution contained standard provisions that meant the funds appropriated by the continuing resolution to DHA’s O&M appropriations account were available for fiscal year (FY) 2025.

The bona fide needs statute provides that a fixed-period appropriation is only available to fulfill a genuine need of the appropriation’s period of availability. The training at issue was a legitimate agency need of FY 2025. During the pendency of the continuing resolution, DHA’s O&M appropriations were available for all of its FY 2025 needs, not only the needs of the time period of the continuing resolution. Therefore, DHA would comply with the bona fide needs statute for incurring obligations for the costs of this training during the continuing resolution, even though the training took place after the continuing resolution ended.

DECISION

A Defense Health Agency (DHA) certifying officer requests our decision under 31 U.S.C. § 3529 on whether DHA could obligate amounts appropriated under a continuing resolution for the registration costs of a training held after the resolution expired.[1]

In accordance with our regular practice, we contacted DHA to seek additional facts and its legal position on this matter.[2] DHA responded with information and its views on this matter.[3]

BACKGROUND

Continuing Resolution

On September 26, 2024, Congress enacted a continuing resolution, which provided appropriations to DHA.[4] The continuing resolution incorporated several standard provisions, three of which are relevant here.[5]

Section 101 of the continuing resolution appropriated fiscal year (FY) 2025 amounts at a “rate for operations” and under the authority and conditions as provided in FY 2024 appropriations acts.[6] Section 103 of the continuing resolution made amounts appropriated by section 101 available “to the extent and in the manner” provided by the pertinent FY 2024 appropriations acts.[7] Section 106 of the continuing resolution directed that all appropriations and authorities provided by the continuing resolution shall be available until the first of three events occurs: the enactment of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in the continuing resolution; the enactment of an FY 2025 appropriation that does not provide funding for a project or activity provided for in the continuing resolution; or December 20, 2024.[8]

At issue here are amounts appropriated by section 101 of the continuing resolution to DHA’s Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriations account.[9] The FY 2024 Appropriations Act provided $36.6 billion in FY 2024 funds to this account, with not to exceed one percent of that amount remaining available through FY 2025.[10] In other words, the act provided funds to DHA for the current fiscal year, and made available for obligation a small portion of those funds for an additional fiscal year.

Training for Medical Professionals

In November 2024, DHA staff sought to process training authorization forms for personnel to attend training for certain medical professionals. The event at issue here was scheduled for March 2025 (March training), and the purpose of it was to strengthen warfighter healthcare operations.[11] Attendees could earn 27 continuing medical education credit hours for attending the training.[12]

According to DHA, the deadline to secure a discounted rate for the March training was November 15, 2024, and DHA would charge the cost to its O&M appropriations account.[13] On November 18, 2024, a DHA component said it could not process the registrations under the continuing resolution.[14]

DISCUSSION

At issue here is whether DHA could obligate funds appropriated by section 101 of the continuing resolution to its O&M appropriations account to cover the registration costs of the March meeting.

Period of Availability of Appropriations Provided by the Continuing Resolution

First, we address the period of availability of appropriations provided to DHA’s O&M appropriations account by the continuing resolution. As explained below, appropriations provided by section 101 of the continuing resolution retain their period of availability from the prior year’s appropriations act only while the continuing resolution is in effect, unless otherwise specified.

As a general matter, continuing resolutions are temporary stop-gap measures intended to keep existing federal programs functioning after the prior year’s appropriations act expires and regular appropriations are not yet in place.[15] Relatedly, continuing resolutions have a limited duration. To this end, continuing resolutions have an end date.[16] After that date passes, if the continuing resolution has not been extended or a full-year appropriations act is not enacted, the funds provided by the continuing resolution are no longer available to incur new obligations.[17]

In addition, continuing resolutions include standard provisions that, when read together, continue the appropriations and authorities of the prior year’s appropriations act. Relevant here, one standard provision—section 101 of the continuing resolution—appropriates “[s]uch amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for operations as provided in the applicable appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2024 and under the authority and conditions provided in such Acts, for continuing projects or activities (including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Act, that were conducted in fiscal year 2024. . . .”[18] In general, this provision appropriates amounts at the levels provided in the FY 2024 Appropriations Act.[19]

Another standard provision of the continuing resolution provides that “appropriations made by section 101 shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided by the pertinent appropriations Act.”[20] When read in conjunction, these provisions provide that appropriations made by section 101 of the continuing resolution are provided at the same amount and for the same period of availability as funds that were provided in the FY 2024 Appropriations Act. Therefore, the continuing resolution, which expired on December 20, 2024, provided $36.6 billion in FY 2025 funds to DHA’s O&M appropriations account, with one percent of such amount available for FYs 2025 and 2026.

Bona Fide Needs Statute

The bona fide needs statute provides that a time-limited appropriation is only available to meet a genuine, or bona fide, need arising during the appropriation’s period of availability.[21] An agency may not use an appropriation for obligations incurred after the appropriation expires, unless otherwise provided.[22]

As explained above, amounts made available to DHA’s O&M appropriations account by the continuing resolution were available for FY 2025, with a small portion available through 2026. Therefore, these amounts were available for the bona fide needs of the entirety of FY 2025, with a small portion also available for FY 2026 needs during the period the continuing resolution was in effect.

In previous decisions, we have held that training is generally a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which it is delivered.[23] Here, the March meeting took place in March 2025, which is in FY 2025. Because the training was delivered in FY 2025, it was a bona fide need of FY 2025 and should be charged to DHA appropriations available for such FY. In addition, registration occurred in November 2024, also in FY 2025, so the timing of the registration raises no bona fide need concerns, even though registration occurred during the period the continuing resolution was in effect. Therefore, DHA could validly incur and record an obligation for the March meeting in November 2024.

For these reasons, DHA would not violate the bona fide needs statute by incurring an obligation during the continuing resolution period against appropriations made by the continuing resolution to its O&M appropriations account.[24]

Antideficiency Act

We next consider whether DHA’s proposed obligation of funds would violate the Antideficiency Act. The Antideficiency Act, in pertinent part, prohibits government officials or employees from obligating or expending in excess or in advance of an appropriation unless otherwise authorized by law.[25]

Were DHA to have incurred the obligation at issue here before the continuing resolution expired, DHA would have used its O&M appropriations, which were available for FY 2025 needs. To the extent DHA had sufficient O&M appropriations available to cover the March meeting’s costs, this obligation would not be in excess or in advance of an appropriation, which the Antideficiency Act prohibits.

In the Request Letter, the certifying officer raised concerns that the registration fees do not satisfy “current CR exceptions not limited to life, health, and/or safety. . . .”[26] Assuming DHA had available funds in its O&M appropriations account to cover the registration costs at issue here, we need not consider whether DHA would have properly complied with the Antideficiency Act’s emergency exception, to determine whether DHA would have complied with the Antideficiency Act had it covered these costs.

CONCLUSION

DHA could obligate appropriations provided to its O&M appropriations account by the continuing resolution, with a termination date of December 20, 2024, in November 2024 for the registration costs of a meeting held in March 2025.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 12:56:24.490707

The good news? The TRICARE Dental Program covers emergency dental care, as noted in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook. You’ll pay no cost-share for emergency dental services, no matter your pay grade or location.

“In any emergency, it’s important to act quickly,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency. “With a bit of preparation and knowledge, you can do your best to keep any damage to a minimum”

Keep reading to learn how to prepare for dental emergencies and what to do when they happen.

What is a dental emergency?

A dental emergency requires immediate attention. You need emergency care if you have:

• Bleeding that won’t stop

• Pain that doesn’t get better with medication

• Broken facial bones

• Painful swelling in or around your mouth

• Gum infection with pain or swelling

• Knocked out or broken tooth

How to prepare

Keep your dentist’s contact information with you at all times. Many dentists have emergency numbers you can call after business hours.

Build a dental emergency kit with these items:

• Cotton balls and swabs

• Dental floss

• Dental mirror

• Latex or vinyl gloves

• Salt

• Cold compress

What to do

Call your dentist first. This is the most important step in any dental emergency. If you don’t have a dentist, use the Find a Dentist tool or go to an urgent care center or emergency room.

For severe tooth pain

1. Rinse your mouth with warm water.

2. Use dental floss to remove any stuck food.

3. Apply a cold compress to the outside of your mouth if you have swelling.

4. Take over-the-counter pain relievers.

For a cracked or broken tooth

1. Save any broken pieces and rinse them.

2. Rinse your mouth with warm water.

3. Apply gauze to bleeding areas for 10 minutes.

4. Use a cold compress on the outside of your mouth to reduce pain and swelling.

For a knocked-out tooth

1. Find the tooth and hold it by the crown.

2. Rinse the root gently with water.

3. Try to put the tooth back in its socket if possible.

4. If you can’t put it back, place it in a small container of milk or salt water.

5. See your dentist within one hour for the best chance of saving the tooth.

For mouth bleeding

1. Rinse with mild salt water.

2. Press a damp gauze on the bleeding spot for 15-20 minutes.

3. Hold a cold compress on the outside of your mouth for 5-10 minutes.

4. If bleeding persists, go to the emergency room immediately.

When it’s not an emergency

Some dental problems can wait for a regular appointment:

• Mild toothache

• Small chip or crack

• Broken braces (unless bleeding)

• Something stuck between teeth

• Minor cuts or sores

If you seek emergency dental care, but your dentist determines it’s not an emergency, you’ll pay the cost-shares for the care you receive.

For these issues, call your dentist to schedule an appointment during normal hours.

Emergency room or dentist?

For most dental emergencies like broken or knocked-out teeth, your dentist will treat you in his/her office. Go to the emergency room for serious injuries like broken facial bones.

Emergency rooms can give you pain medication and antibiotics, but they don’t do dental work like fillings or crowns. You’ll still need to see your dentist as soon as possible.

Dental emergencies need quick action. The faster you get help, the better your chances of saving your teeth and avoiding additional problems later. Remember:

1. Call your dentist.

2. Follow first aid steps until you can get professional care.

3. Don’t wait, prompt treatment prevents infection and tooth loss.

In the middle of unpacking boxes and switching to a new TRICARE region, there’s barely time to catch your breath — let alone monitor every unfamiliar phone call or credit card charge.

Maybe you’ve stopped screening calls like you used to or maybe you’ve let autopay handle your finances this month. It’s easy to miss a red flag — or worse, engage with something you shouldn’t.

That’s exactly how scammers slip through the cracks.

Anyone who grew up alongside the evolution of dial-up to Starlink knows better than to wire money to a whining Nigerian prince, but scammers have evolved far beyond those early internet cons.

Tactics have become more sophisticated, and phone and email filters are constantly playing catch-up. With caller ID spoofing and AI-generated messages, it’s getting harder to tell what’s real and what’s a scam.

Phishing emails are the most common entry point for identity theft in the world, according to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). These messages are crafted to look official, complete with logos, familiar language, and links that closely mimic legitimate websites.

Military personnel were even the target of a scam that the Federal Trade Commission flagged in 2023. In this scheme, fraudsters pose as representatives from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), claiming there’s a problem with your pay and pressuring you to confirm personal information or send money through third-party apps. The FTC and most financial institutions emphasize: they’ll never call out of the blue or request payment through apps like Zelle or PayPal. What sounds like a routine customer service message might actually be a red flag.

How to protect yourself

Fortunately, staying safe from identity theft doesn’t require a degree in cybersecurity — just a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to second-guess anything that feels off.

Secure your devices and logins: Use multi-factor authentication on accounts like MyPay, TRICARE, and VA. Avoid public Wi-Fi for anything sensitive unless you have a VPN (your TAD hotel lobby isn’t the place to check your bank balance). And yes, those software update pop-ups matter. Keep your antivirus protection and operating system up to date.

Monitor your financial accounts: Make it a habit to scan your bank and credit card statements regularly. Set up transaction alerts so you know if something weird pops up. Some third-party identity monitoring services, like LifeLock, can notify you anytime your social security number is used in an application for a new account. This can help you catch fraud before it snowballs. And if something does seem off? Fortunately, your bank and the major credit bureaus have systems in place to help, especially when caught early.

Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts: Scammers count on you being too busy (or too polite) to second-guess a sketchy message. Don’t click links in unsolicited texts or emails, no matter how official they seem. If someone calls claiming you have an overdue tax bill or a warrant out for your arrest, hang up and call back using the organization’s publicly listed number. If it’s legit, they’ll understand. If it’s not, enjoy the relief of having dodged a scam.

Use resources designed for military families: Free active-duty credit monitoring is available, and you can check your credit report annually at annualcreditreport.com. DFAS also offers guidance on their website; this one is worth bookmarking before you actually need it.

If you think your information has been compromised, act fast. Report suspicious activity to your bank and credit card company immediately. File a report with the FTC on their website, and place a credit freeze or fraud alert with the three major credit bureaus.

Unfortunately, protecting yourself from identity theft isn’t a one-and-done task. It takes ongoing awareness. So, stay alert, ask questions, and trust your gut. But also know that you can contact your base legal office or Military OneSource for guidance and support.",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2189791535-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 10:56:23.236269

From extreme weather changes to limited communications and infrastructure, the Arctic poses unique challenges for troops and medical personnel. Senior leaders and health experts agree that medical and operational readiness is vital in the region as its strategic importance grows.

Why the Arctic matters

The Arctic spans three continents and encompasses eight nations, seven of which are NATO members. New trade routes have opened in the region — enabling faster global shipping and easier access to untapped resources. It can be described as a region of extremes: extreme cold, extreme seasonal changes in daylight, extreme winds, and extreme terrain.

For the U.S. military, an Arctic presence secures national defense, maritime access, and humanitarian support, while also addressing environmental concerns, said U.S. military medical experts.

Medical operations in Arctic environments were topics at two major Military Health System conferences this year, in April at the 2025 MHS Annual Conference and in August at the 2025 MHS Research Symposium.

“While the Arctic was once envisioned as a neutral zone where research and conservation could promote deeper international cooperation, multiple developments since then have turned it into a site of competition,” said Air Force Col Gabriel DiNofrio, Deputy Command Surgeon, U.S. Northern Command, during the 2025 MHS Conference.

Medical care in the extreme cold

Operating in the Arctic pushes medical systems and equipment to their limits. Cold affects every aspect of care, from supplies to personnel.

“When everything freezes — blood, tubing, and medical machines — how do you provide medical care in this environment?” asked Army Col. Manuel Menéndez, Special Operations Forces North Command surgeon, at the 2025 MHS Conference. Most medical equipment is not designed for extreme cold. Batteries drain quickly, plastics become brittle, adhesives don’t stick, and medications can freeze before use.

“Plastics freeze and snap. Fluids will flash-freeze,” said Marine Capt. Jeffrey Feinberg, Marine Forces Europe Africa command surgeon. “For all those super great things we have, the batteries are going to last a fraction of the time.”

Andres Martinez Murillo, a biomedical engineer at Naval Medical Research Unit - San Antonio, stressed the importance of reliable gear and equipment at the 2025 MHS Research Symposium. “It is important to know that our medical equipment works in these Arctic conditions. Storage and the materials used to make these materials need to improve to withstand the extreme cold.”

His team at NAMRU-SA is studying the effects of cold weather on military equipment and developing solutions. They discovered that commonly used medical items, such as stethoscopes and medical tubing, crack in extreme cold weather.

Exposure injuries can rise sharply in the Arctic. Hypothermia and frostbite can appear within minutes, and half of frostbite cases never fully recover. “Even mild hypothermia triples the risk of death after injury.” Feinberg said.

Lack of familiarity

One of the biggest challenges for U.S. troops, according to Feinberg, is inexperience with Arctic conditions.

“We are not used to cold climates. We don’t have a lot of people who can inherently look at that and go, those are the wrong shoes,” Feinberg said. “When we first take a force up there, they don’t know what right looks like.”

Menéndez agreed, “You have to be out there. You have to experience the environment, and then you learn a lot of lessons.”

DiNofrio highlighted three key readiness focus areas: “Understanding what is required physically, how to move people and equipment without freezing, and how to provide medical care in this environment.”

The critical role of gear

The first line of defense is what service members wear. Layered clothing, insulated boots, and protective gloves are essential.

“Every time you don’t have to take your gloves off to do something, that’s a personal win,” said Jeffrey B. Phillips, a senior research scientist at the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition, said at MHS Research Symposium. “Gloves that allow dexterity while preserving heat can mean the difference between staying effective or suffering frostbite.”

Boots must resist moisture and allow movement in snow and ice. Service members also depend on insulated layers that trap body heat without restricting motion. When combined, this gear forms personal heat protection that allows survival long enough to fight, move, and provide care.

The military is also implementing cold-weather gear in exercise drills. Menéndez discussed the success of experiments at a 2025 training exercise, including the use of nanofibers on socks and gloves to assess insulation and the use of biosensors on operators to monitor heart rate, body temperature, and exertion.

Training and readiness

To close gaps in training and mission readiness, U.S. forces are relying on realistic exercises that mimic Arctic conditions.

Special Operations Command North has piloted a program, Special Operations Forces Arctic Medic, that teaches service members how to stay warm, move patients, and deliver care without leaving thermal or electronic signatures. Lessons include skiing during storms to avoid detection, carrying blood inside clothing to prevent freezing, and creating “heat bubbles” to protect patients, according to Menéndez.

In one exercise, medics performed real surgery on perfused cadavers aboard a moving train in Alaska, guided in real time by surgeons at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas. The test showed how augmented reality and satellite communications can bridge gaps in expertise far from hospitals.

Mental readiness also matters — extended periods of darkness, isolation, and extreme cold can strain morale. Several speakers at the conferences emphasized buddy checks, nutrition, and realistic expectations to help service members adjust to their new environment.

Working with international partners vital to mission success

International collaboration is critical in the Arctic, spanning multiple nations. Evacuations often require patient transfers across agencies and allies.

Exercises such as Arctic Edge, the Norwegian military-led Cold Response, and Joint Viking allow U.S. forces to train alongside allies in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Canada.

“If you can’t hand a patient from SEALS to Special Forces to the Coast Guard to the Air Force without changing out tubing, you’re not going to succeed,” said Menéndez.

Feinberg noted that allies are eager to train together, to collaborate, and to become familiar with their backyard.

For the U.S. military, learning how to adapt to the Arctic is a mission readiness requirement — and staying fit to fight is imperative when cold weather can be the biggest threat. “The environment is trying to kill both of us: us and the enemy,” said Menéndez, “but if I can move faster … further than the enemy … I win.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2502/8892007/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 10:56:28.182273

WASHINGTON, Sept. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Coalition for Access to Autism Services (NCAAS) today hailed the release of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's comprehensive report confirming what military families, autism care providers, and advocates have long argued: Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a medically necessary service for many autistic individuals and should be treated as a standard benefit by TRICARE, the military services' healthcare program for active-duty service members and veterans.

The 336-page congressionally mandated study, The Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration: Solutions for Military Families, rejects the Department of Defense's prior conclusions about ABA and calls on TRICARE to recognize ABA as a core benefit for military families.

""This report is a watershed moment for our military families,"" said Mike Moran, chairman of NCAAS. ""The National Academies recommended that the Department of Defense should discontinue its current autism care program and authorize coverage of applied behavior analysis—a primary and highly personalized therapeutic approach to autism—as a basic benefit under the TRICARE program, including moving the ABA billing program off the No Government Pay List.""

TRICARE is an outlier. While nearly all commercial and self-funded employer plans, Medicaid, CHIP, FEHBP, and CHAMPVA cover ABA, TRICARE still treats it as a temporary demonstration. The National Academies study not only identifies ABA as a standard of care to address autism, but it recommends that ABA services be available to address maladaptive behaviors and activities of daily living affecting the health and well-being of children with autism, including:

Removal of current restrictions that do not allow medically necessary ABA services in schools and other community settings for purposes of targeting behaviors and skills outside the home.

Allowing reimbursement for higher staff-to-client ratios and crisis intervention procedures were deemed necessary by the ABA provider.

NCAAS first became concerned in 2018 about the Department of Defense's reports to Congress questioning the efficacy of the Department's Autism Care Demonstration, which were predicated on conclusions drawn from the DoD's incorrect use of a widely used assessment tool and TRICARE's misuse of patient data in the Autism Care Demonstration—conclusions that have been invalidated by the National Academies report. NCAAS raised these concerns with Pentagon officials and the Congressional Armed Services Committees, which led to Congress directing National Academies to undertake the independent analysis that it issued this month.

""For years, military families were told that the Defense Health Agency's data showed ABA was ineffective. The National Academies found those conclusions were based on misused measures that could never capture children's real progress,"" said Julie Kornack, an NCAAS board member. ""Now we have the definitive word: the problem was not ABA, but the way TRICARE measured it. Military families deserve better, and this report makes clear the system must change.""

The project included the installation of 188 Aruba wireless access points (APs), each covering an average of 2,500 to 3,500 square feet. Together, the APs provide wireless coverage spanning more than 500,000 square feet, ensuring seamless connectivity throughout Kenner’s footprint.

“The new wireless access points will provide better performance, boosted security, and better redundancy while moving about the clinics,” said Mr. John Carter, Chief Information Officer and day shift lead. “They also allow us to connect our personal devices to the DHA Guest wireless.”

To support the expanded system, the Network team re-wired every communications closet and added 47 additional lines and data drops where needed. More than 10,000 feet of CAT 6 ethernet cable—nearly two miles—were laid during the project.

In addition, the team installed 60 new network switches across Kenner’s facilities and 29 Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) in all communications closets to maintain network stability during power outages. The extensive effort required round-the-clock work, with day shifts managed by Carter and Mr. Timothy Hurd, and night shifts led by Mr. Michael Losoya and Mr. James Corbin.

Before installation, the Defense Health Agency’s WLAN team conducted a “heat mapping” of the clinic—walking each space with specialized equipment to pinpoint signal weak spots and guide the placement of access points. With the upgrades complete, Kenner Army Health Clinic has significantly enhanced its digital backbone, supporting both mission-critical operations and daily patient care with reliable, high-speed connectivity.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9329796/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-21 18:56:19.419692

Meanwhile, his mother juggled Waze directions, a spilled Capri Sun, and a Bluetooth call with the gaining base’s EFMP coordinator. The family dog barked nonstop. Her spouse was somewhere behind them in convoy formation. In the midst of the chaos, she had an epiphany: this wasn’t just another move.

This was going to be one of those chapters, the ones where resilience stops being a mantra reiterated ad nauseam and starts being actual survival.

When Military Life Complicates Neurodivergence

In civilian life, stability serves as an anchor for neurodivergent children. In military life, stability is a pipe dream, one routinely overruled by mission requirements.

Each new base means a new school, a new search for therapy services (if they exist at all), a fresh diagnostic process, and a familiar refrain: “We’re not taking new patients right now.”

It’s like the movie Groundhog Day, but with more paperwork and less personal growth.

Individualized Education Programs (IEP) rarely transfer smoothly. Applied Behavior Analysis therapy has waitlists longer than some deployments. And ever-looming is the fear that this PCS will be the one where a child falls through the cracks.

EFMP: Exceptional, Frustrating, Mostly Paperwork

The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) is designed to help families with unique medical or educational needs. And sometimes, it does.

It’s the reason one family didn’t get sent OCONUS. It’s also the reason they’ve filled out the same dozen forms in triplicate every year since diagnosis.

There are standout EFMP coordinators, heroes who deserve medals and raises. But the program’s effectiveness often depends on local execution, and not every base is equipped (or wholly motivated) to support neurodiversity well.

Still, a flagged assignment is better than the alternative: being stationed somewhere without adequate services and watching a child regress while the system shrugs its shoulders.

What Actually Helps

Resources like Military OneSource, grassroots Facebook groups, and that one eager parent who shows up at the playground with spreadsheets are invaluable tools.

There are organizations designed to help. Autism Speaks will provide resources, including their Military Families and Autism Advocacy program. While Operation Autism was launched to provide a resource guide, one complete with information specifically for military families with autistic children.

Support can come from unexpected places: pediatricians who understand sensory needs, virtual OT sessions from licensed providers across state lines, even a chaplain who learned to sign “stim” to connect with a child on base.

However, it goes even deeper. Organizations like Partners in PROMISE are advocating for systemic change in how EFMP operates. The ARC’s Center for Future Planning offers tailored guidance for military families navigating long-term care. Base-level support services, such as School Liaison Officers (SLOs), Family Advocacy Programs, and installation-specific EFMP case managers, can be game changers when families know how to access them.

Tricare’sAutism Care Demonstration (ACD) covers autism services, including Applied Behavior Analysis, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, counseling, and even respite care. Their expanded telehealth coverage has been a blessing in remote duty stations, especially for families in rural or overseas locations. And for those facing relocation, STOMP (Specialized Training of Military Parents) offers trainings that demystify IEPs, 504s, and procedural safeguards.

The help exists. But finding it often takes persistence, networking, and a bit of luck. Sometimes it requires an e-tool; other times, a backhoe might be necessary.

The Mission Within the Mission

Raising a neurodivergent child in the military isn’t about fixing them. It’s about creating a sense of stability—a foundation that can adapt with each PCS, each deployment, and each EFMP update.

The victories are small but strong: a grocery run without a meltdown equals a win. A teacher who proactively uses visual aids is a godsend. A command team that treats neurodivergent families as assets, not admin burdens, is a family.

There are no parades. But there is strength, not in spite of the chaos, but forged like coal into a diamond; the pressure is what defines and creates hardiness.

For families searching for “autism services near Fort Wherever,” know this: you’re not alone. There are groups of those who walk the same miles in the same shoes out there.
