Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","We came across a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. on Valueinvestorsclub.com by skimmer610. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRAL. GRAIL, Inc.’s share was trading at $32.42 as of September 3rd.

GRAIL (NASDAQ: GRAL) represents a compelling risk-reward opportunity in early cancer detection through its Galleri blood test, the first commercially viable multi-cancer early detection (MCED) platform. The company, spun out of Illumina in 2016 and recently spun off again in 2024, has $678 million in cash and a $320 million annual burn rate, with a market cap of $1.6 billion and enterprise value of $900 million.

Galleri addresses a massive market, with over 100 million Americans eligible for screening and a global TAM exceeding $150 billion. Priced at $949 per test, the platform demonstrates strong gross margin potential even if prices fall to $500, and near-term revenues are growing rapidly, up 39% YoY in Q4 2024, supported by partnerships with Quest, Tricare, and life insurers.

Galleri leverages cfDNA methylation sequencing and machine learning to detect 50+ cancers, supported by Illumina’s bioinformatics IP and a proprietary 300K-sample biospecimen dataset, creating a defensible data moat. Clinical traction is strong, with 137K tests sold in 2024 and ongoing PATHFINDER-2 and NHS-Galleri trials.

Statistical analysis of combined trial data predicts ~350 early cancers detected from 175K patients, significantly shifting late-stage incidence and supporting FDA approval. Published studies show high specificity (99.5%) and strong sensitivity across multiple cancers, far exceeding competitors.

Key catalysts over the next 12–18 months include final PATHFINDER-2 results, FDA PMA filing, CMS reimbursement clarity, and NHS coverage decisions. Valuation scenarios range from $28/share in a bear case to $310/share in a bull case, with a base case of $145/share reflecting steady payer adoption. While regulatory and reimbursement risks exist, GRAL’s validated technology, first-mover advantage, massive market, and strong trial data suggest asymmetric upside, positioning the stock for significant gains as it approaches its pivotal 2025–2026 inflection window.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL) by mike-some in April 2025, which highlighted the company’s leadership in multi-cancer early detection, the spin-off from Illumina, promising PATHFINDER trial results, and potential Medicare/NHS reimbursement driving significant sales. The stock has appreciated ~25% since coverage. Skimmer610 shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes detailed financials, trial statistics, and near-term FDA and CMS catalysts.

GRAIL, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 25 hedge fund portfolios held GRAL at the end of the first quarter which was 28 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GRAL and that has 10,000% upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.

Disclosure: None.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

After the opening plenary session, Pat Flanders, program executive officer - medical systems/chief information officer, and Thomas Hines, chief information security officer, presented the DHA IT awards to CIOs for their assistance in supporting DHA’s strategic objectives.

Flanders established the awards to honor offices or personnel who excel in three categories in support of DHA’s Program Management Office-Medical Systems. “This year’s Military Medical Treatment Facility and Clinic Chief Information Officer Award winners showcase the remarkable talent of our Defense Health Agency IT professionals, and I really appreciate their efforts in helping bolster my strategic priorities,” said Flanders.

Three DHA teams received awards for their work in auditability compliance, cybersecurity, and rationalization/alignment of resources in military hospital and clinics.

Cybersecurity

Air Force Master Sgt. Jonathan Rodriguez-Feliciano, deputy chief information officer at the 374th Medical Group at Yokota Air Base in Japan, accepted the award for cybersecurity. This award is presented to the site that excels in all aspects of cybersecurity, which includes doing the best job managing their authorizations to operate and their overall cyber hygiene.

Our team took a proactive, “all-hands” approach to strengthening our cyber posture, explained Rodriguez-Feliciano. “We partnered with higher headquarters and subject matter experts to execute thousands of security checklist items across every system and clinic. That meant reviewing policies, hardening networks, training staff, and validating compliance line by line. With leadership involvement and full support from our staff, we turned our inspection into an opportunity to elevate how we operate every day.”

Auditability compliance

The audibility compliance award was presented to the site that complies best with monthly reporting requirements as laid out in a DHA procedural instruction on information security compliance. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ezekiel Gandy accepted the award on behalf of the 8th Medical Group, Kunsan Air Base in South Korea.

The award recognized the medical group’s support of financial auditability as it ensures transparency, accountability, and proper stewardship of taxpayer money, and is in alignment with a key DHA procedural instruction This instruction requires CIOs to certify compliance with the various system reporting, and the Kunsan Air Base team met monthly requirements without fail.

Rationalization / alignment of resources

The Rationalization / Alignment of Resources Award recognizes the chief information office that excelled in submitting monthly reports in Ektropy, a DHA system that helps leader visualize the management of IT resources, personnel, and costs. The award was presented to the Lyster Army Health Clinic at Fort Rucker in Alabama. The award was accepted by Kelly McCreery, deputy chief information officer.

The referral approval waiver was issued by the Defense Health Agency in January to minimize disruption to care while a new regional contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, transitioned to provide services.

This meant beneficiaries in TRICARE Region West did not need to wait for TriWest to approve referrals issued by their primary care manager before receiving outpatient specialty care off post.

“If you are currently seeing a specialist using that waiver, this is a critical deadline coming up. Referrals issued during the referral approval waiver period end Sept. 30, and you may be subject to out-of-pocket expenses after that time if you haven’t taken action to update your referral,” said Toni McCall, Munson’s chief of Business Operations Division.

Munson transitioned back to TriWest referral processing in early June, so, many referrals were already processed by TriWest and may already be valid past the September 30 deadline associated with the referral approval waiver.

“Because we resumed referral processing early in June, patients should first verify the validity of their current referral before requesting a new one,” said McCall, emphasizing that this expiration only applies to ongoing care received using the referral approval waiver.

CHECK YOUR REFERRAL STATUS FIRST:

The fastest and most efficient way to check your referral's valid dates is by logging into the TriWest Patient Portal at https://tricare.triwest.com/en/beneficiary, where the regional contractor reviews referrals submitted by your PCM for approval and authorization.

If you don't use the portal, you can call TriWest directly at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378) to inquire about the status of your existing referral.

ONLY REQUEST A NEW REFERRAL IF NECESSARY:

If your TriWest portal shows NO authorization for your continued care after September 30, 2025, THEN follow these steps:

The preferred method for requesting a new referral is to send a secure message to your primary care team through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal secure message function at https://my.mhsgenesis.health.mil/. This allows for efficient communication and record-keeping.

If you do not have access to the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal, you can call the Munson Army Health Center Appointment Line at 913-684-6250 and request that a message be sent to your primary care team.

“We want to make this transition as smooth as possible for our beneficiaries at Fort Leavenworth,” said McCall. “By checking your referral status first, you can avoid unnecessary steps and ensure you receive the care you need without interruption.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9317994/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-16 13:56:07.986040

Critical collaboration Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.","As military medicine embraces artificial intelligence and digital technology, top Department of War health leaders stressed that strong governance is critical to safely drive innovation to adopt these tools that improve patient outcomes and drive increased military readiness.

During the Defense Health Information Technology Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee, in August 2025, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for health affairs and Ms. Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of war for health services policy and oversight, provided insight into how governance ensures the Military Health System is digitally enabled, safe, interoperable, and aligned with warfighter mission readiness.

Ferrara underscored governance is what translates technology into real outcomes, saying, “We need to deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled and globally partnered system of readiness and health care … where a medic in CENTCOM can consult a trauma specialist at Walter Reed in seconds.”

Digital Health AI policies, particularly the use and governance of AI, is an area Dr. Ferrara has asked that Orsega prioritize.

“We've got to be prepared for the ever-changing warfare ecosystem,” Orsega said. “It is imperative to be integrating and to be interoperable in those digital health spaces, so that we have those tools from either the battlefield to the bedside.”

Governance is foundationally essential to keep up with rapidly evolving AI, she said, for “the scale, the challenges, the demand, the clear priorities, and policies to focus ourselves strategically, enhancing the operational efficiencies … and looking at the readiness of the force.”

The MHS has established guardrails to ensure the use of AI and other advanced tools are implemented responsibly through the MHS Digital Policy Council, launched in March 2025. In her recent appointment as the chair, Orsega cited the policy as assurance that technology, data, and AI efforts are aligned and governed across the MHS “by streamlining digital priorities, reducing redundancies, and focusing on health data as a readiness tool.”

“The digital policy council is intended to ensure that we take a look at, not pull down, the redundancies,” she said. “At the same time, we want to ensure that we have horizontal synergy across all the services.”

Orsega provided an example of a large organization’s diagnostic oncology AI tool as an essential lesson learned in the need for oversight. The AI system once promised to revolutionize cancer care, but it often produced unsafe or irrelevant recommendations. “The clinicians could not rely on that piece of the AI tool to make clear decisions,” she said.

The failure, she said, was not the technology itself but the absence of efficient oversight, as the tool needed stronger governance, infrastructure, and the ability to be audited to ensure better outcomes and reliability.

By contrast, she pointed to the Cleveland Clinic’s Digital Health Playbook as a guide that provides clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and processes for using digital tools. The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.”

Safe adoption bolsters readiness

For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.

“We’re focused on a mission that cuts across so many sectors — delivering smarter, integrated, data-driven health care for service members and their families,” said Ferrara. “It’s more than a technical conversation; it’s an operational imperative.”

He highlighted the full deployment of MHS GENESIS, the electronic health record that provides a single health record for service members, veterans, and family members, as a digital foundation to readiness.

“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical records to follow them from basic training to the battlefield, and ultimately home, and soon to the VA in one smooth, uninterrupted flow,” Ferrara explained.

With MHS GENESIS in place, Ferrara said the MHS is investing in AI-powered support for PTSD, suicide risk, and traumatic brain injury. He also emphasized that oversight is critical: “It’s not merely about adopting new technologies, but how we strategically integrate them into our workflows to improve patient outcomes and ultimately bolster the readiness of our fighting force,” he said.

Building the guardrails

The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective. Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.

Orsega outlined four areas where the council provided this much-needed governance stability:

Policy and process: Tie AI tools to accountability

Inclusive expertise: Support of clinicians, scientists, and technologists in the room together

Audit platforms, data integrity, and infrastructure: Foundation for safe use

Training: Certify health care professionals can use AI tools responsibly.

Critical collaboration

Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.

“None of this work can succeed in silos,” Ferrara said. “Our public-private partnerships are essential, not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly.”

Orsega added that governance extends beyond the Department of War. NATO’s Committee of Chiefs of Military Medical Services, she noted, is already examining digital transformation, biotech, and decision-support systems in multi-domain operations. Collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies is equally critical.

She stressed the importance of preparing “for that ever-changing ecosystem, either homeland or abroad, and it's our battle cry to ensure that we have those right tools, so that we have the right policies and processes and standards in place,” noting that if there is an urgent need to use digital tools, “we feel really comfortable and confident that our tools are reliable and that they're laser precise for that decision in that moment.”

Orsega concluded by encouraging attendees of DHITS — comprised of government, military, and industry health care information technology professionals — “to be a part of the solution.”

“We have a unique opportunity to confront the challenges that lie ahead and to take that bold initiative.”

How to check whether your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic You can visit the Novo Nordisk NovoCare site to see if your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic.","Ozempic is a brand-name prescription drug that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk reduction, and kidney disease in adults. Healthcare providers may also prescribe Ozempic off-label (a non-FDA-approved use) for weight loss and long-term weight management. Ozempic is part of a group of drugs called glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) and contains the active ingredient semaglutide. If you are prescribed this once-weekly injectable medicine, you may want to know whether your TRICARE plan provides coverage, since Ozempic can be expensive without insurance or prescription discounts.

Does TRICARE cover Ozempic?

Many TRICARE plans provide coverage of Ozempic for Type 2 diabetes, although coverage varies by plan.

In order for TRICARE to cover Ozempic, you’ll need to meet the clinical criteria for Type 2 diabetes and have your healthcare provider submit a prior authorization form. As of Aug. 31, 2025, your healthcare provider will also have to submit proof of medical necessity, but only if you choose to have your Ozempic prescription filled at a military pharmacy and pay the lower formulary copay. If you fill your prescription at a retail or mail-order pharmacy, a prior authorization should suffice. This coverage also applies to similar drugs like Mounjaro, Victoza, and Trulicity.

Currently, TRICARE covers Ozempic for Type 2 diabetes, but not for weight loss. If you have TRICARE and want coverage for weight loss medication, you may want to consider Wegovy (semaglutide), Zepbound (tirzepatide), Saxenda (liraglutide), Qsymia (phentermine-topiramate ER), phentermine, or Contrave. TRICARE may cover those medications for weight loss, but only for certain beneficiary groups. Coverage also depends on your condition and certain criteria. Prior authorization and step therapy, which involves trying more affordable options first, are required.

How much is Ozempic without insurance?

If you are paying without insurance, a typical prescription of Ozempic (one 3 mL pen containing 2 mg/3 mL) costs about $1,387. By using a SingleCare card or coupon, you can pay as low as $825 for your Ozempic pen—a savings of $562 each time you fill your prescription.

How much does Ozempic cost with TRICARE?

There are several options in terms of pharmacies where you can fill your Ozempic prescription with TRICARE, and your cost may vary by pharmacy:

Military Treatment Facility (MTF) pharmacy: This is the primary pharmacy option for active duty service members. Prescriptions are typically filled at no cost ($0) at an MTF, but coverage rules still apply—Ozempic is considered non-formulary and requires both prior authorization and a medical necessity form. Non-active duty beneficiaries may also use MTF pharmacies and may pay a reduced copay.

TRICARE Home Delivery (mail order): Up to a 90-day supply is available for $76 for non-active duty beneficiaries, with prior authorization required.

Retail pharmacies in the TRICARE network: A 30-day supply is typically $76 for non-active duty beneficiaries, with prior authorization required.

Because coverage and out-of-pocket costs can vary depending on your status, the pharmacy you use to fill your prescription, and any policy updates, it’s always best to check your exact cost and coverage through the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool or by calling member services.

How to check whether your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic

You can visit the Novo Nordisk NovoCare site to see if your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic. Select government insurance, which includes TRICARE, and enter the required information to find out more about your benefits on your specific TRICARE health plan.

You can also check the TRICARE Formulary Search feature. On this website, you will enter the drug Ozempic, select the prescribed dose, and enter your biological gender and age. The results will show different options based on your pharmacy (military pharmacy, mail order pharmacy, or retail pharmacy) and whether you are active duty or not active duty. Ozempic typically requires a prior authorization under TRICARE, which means your healthcare provider will have to submit information to your plan as to why this medicine is medically necessary, and then the plan will make a coverage decision.

You can also call your TRICARE representative directly to find out more about Ozempic cost and coverage. Another way to find out about Ozempic coverage on your TRICARE plan is to have your healthcare provider send the prescription to your preferred pharmacy. The pharmacy staff will process the prescription and may be able to initiate the prior authorization process.

How to save on Ozempic

One of the best ways to save money on Ozempic is by using a SingleCare coupon. It’s free to use, and you can use the discount every month to save hundreds of dollars on your prescription. SingleCare is accepted at over 35,000 pharmacies in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

There are also other ways to save on Ozempic. The manufacturer’s website lists various savings options. However, these options have eligibility criteria and are typically only for people with commercial health insurance (or who are uninsured)—people with government insurance plans such as TRICARE do not qualify for these offers. You can also check prices at various pharmacies to see who has the best prices—what’s more, some pharmacies may offer a discount if you purchase a larger quantity up front (such as a three-month supply). It’s also a good idea to ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider if they know of any local resources in your community that can help pay for the cost of your medicines.",https://www.singlecare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/does-tricare-cover-ozempic.png,N,0.0,2025-09-16 18:56:07.395658

Three DHA teams received awards for their work in auditability compliance, cybersecurity, and rationalization/alignment of resources in military hospital and clinics.

Cybersecurity

Air Force Master Sgt. Jonathan Rodriguez-Feliciano, deputy chief information officer at the 374th Medical Group at Yokota Air Base in Japan, accepted the award for cybersecurity. This award is presented to the site that excels in all aspects of cybersecurity, which includes doing the best job managing their authorizations to operate and their overall cyber hygiene.

Our team took a proactive, “all-hands” approach to strengthening our cyber posture, explained Rodriguez-Feliciano. “We partnered with higher headquarters and subject matter experts to execute thousands of security checklist items across every system and clinic. That meant reviewing policies, hardening networks, training staff, and validating compliance line by line. With leadership involvement and full support from our staff, we turned our inspection into an opportunity to elevate how we operate every day.”

Auditability compliance

The audibility compliance award was presented to the site that complies best with monthly reporting requirements as laid out in a DHA procedural instruction on information security compliance. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ezekiel Gandy accepted the award on behalf of the 8th Medical Group, Kunsan Air Base in South Korea.

The award recognized the medical group’s support of financial auditability as it ensures transparency, accountability, and proper stewardship of taxpayer money, and is in alignment with a key DHA procedural instruction This instruction requires CIOs to certify compliance with the various system reporting, and the Kunsan Air Base team met monthly requirements without fail.

Rationalization / alignment of resources

The Rationalization / Alignment of Resources Award recognizes the chief information office that excelled in submitting monthly reports in Ektropy, a DHA system that helps leader visualize the management of IT resources, personnel, and costs.

Despite their vocal objections, Democrats failed to stop six last-minute amendments aimed at restricting the rights of transgender individuals in the U.S. military, all of which passed via voice vote. Seventeen Democrats ultimately sided with Republicans in voting for the amended bill.

Sweeping Anti-Trans Provisions Approved

The controversial amendments included:

Two bans on medically necessary gender-affirming healthcare — including mental health services — for transgender service members and their families.

A ban on transgender women participating in sports at military academies.

A prohibition on the Department of Defence collecting gender identity data, requiring surveys to refer only to sex assigned at birth.

Restrictions preventing trans individuals from using gender-aligned facilities on military installations.

A ban on Pride flag displays at any U.S. military facility.

House Floor Clashes Over Pride Flag and Healthcare

Representative Maxine Dexter (D-OR) attempted to defend the right to display the Pride flag, challenging the reversal of a previous NDAA compromise that gave base commanders discretion on such displays. She called the amendment “cruel and callous” and placed a small Pride flag on the podium as she spoke.

Her gesture sparked immediate backlash from Republican members. A Florida representative objected, backed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who demanded the flag be removed.

“That flag violates our House rules,” said the presiding officer.

“I am not waving it, Mr. Speaker,” Dexter replied, continuing her statement. “This obsession with attacking, dehumanising, and villainising our LGBTQIA community is as sick as it is a waste of time. Trump is using the same tired playbook authoritarian regimes have used throughout history.”

Heated Exchanges Over Gender-Affirming Care

Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) also took the floor to oppose Mace’s amendment banning TRICARE coverage for gender-affirming procedures. When Jacobs highlighted procedures such as breast augmentation and filler treatments as medically recognised forms of gender-affirming care, Mace shouted across the chamber, “You are absolutely ridiculous! What the hell is your problem?”

Mace later escalated the exchange on social media, implying Jacobs, who is Jewish, needed a “nose job,” a comment widely condemned as antisemitic.

LGBTQ+ Advocates Condemn the Legislation

Congressional Equality Caucus Chair Rep. Mark Takano released a statement after the bill’s passage, condemning Republicans for what he described as injecting “poison-pill riders” into a bill meant to improve the lives of military personnel.

“Republicans’ sacrifice of a strong bipartisan vote for a politicised NDAA to appease the Trump Administration and a small slice of their base cannot undo the sacrifice of the transgender servicemembers, cadets, or military dependents that will be hurt by this bill,” Takano stated. “Congress should be fighting for those who fight for us—but it’s clear the GOP has other priorities.”

The DHN-PR headquarters is located in San Diego, overseeing military hospitals and clinics along the U.S. West Coast and overseas in Guam and Japan.","SAN DIEGO – Capt. Kathleen Cooperman, the new deputy director for Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR), visited the Virtual Medical Operations Center (VMOC) at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) Sept. 3 to learn firsthand how the hub is transforming patient care and operational medical support across the Military Health System.

Cooperman, a native of Arlington, Virginia, comes to the network after serving as commanding officer of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Okinawa and director of U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan, from July 2023 to August 2025. A graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with a master’s degree in health administration, and the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California she has served in Navy Medicine’s Medical Service Corps for more than two decades.

NMCSD is one of nine military treatment facilities in the DHN-PR and during her visit, Cooperman received an overview of the VMOC’s current role, which includes providing real-time inpatient virtual care and tele-critical care support to military hospitals and clinics worldwide. By centralizing monitoring and leveraging specialized providers virtually, the VMOC extends critical care expertise to military treatment facilities and operational forces around the globe, improving readiness while delivering safe, high-quality patient care.

“As I learn about DHN Pacific Rim’s operations and capabilities, visits like this are so important,” Cooperman said. “My role is to listen, learn, and help connect the dots so we can integrate and scale capabilities like the VMOC into robust resources with global reach to provide health care expertise and strengthen collaboration across the Military Health System.”

Brian Howard, assistant director for support operations at DHN Pacific Rim, organized the visit to familiarize Cooperman with the VMOC’s role in supporting both military medical treatment facilities and operational missions.

“This center has grown from an idea several years ago into a capability that today supports more than two dozen MTFs,” said Howard. “It’s not about replacing in-person care, it’s about extending the expertise of medical specialists across the Military Health System to save lives.”

Howard explained that the VMOC model allows intensivists and other specialists to provide real-time guidance from San Diego to teams on the ground, from walking providers in an ICU at an overseas hospital through a difficult case to advising corpsmen and medics in the field.

“This is an extender of our medical force,” he said. “We can’t put a critical care specialist everywhere, but through the VMOC we can connect them to patients and providers who need their knowledge and skills—whether it’s at U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Madigan Army Medical Center, or a corpsman managing a traumatic injury downrange.”

Looking ahead, the VMOC is exploring opportunities to expand services such as EEG monitoring, ad-hoc dialysis, and advanced consultative support, while piloting new approaches to integrate digital health and readiness tools.

“The VMOC is impressive,” said Cooperman. “And to really maximize its potential, to take it to the next level, we need to define and codify the program requirements and organizationally align capabilities as a portfolio of assets to ensure we optimize the MHS as a system. Looking to the future and how we care for the warfighter during the next global conflict to save lives and keep them in the fight, this is the time to invest in resources like the VMOC and drive the readiness portion of the Defense Health Agency’s responsibility to the Indo-Pacific.”

Cooperman’s visit underscored DHA’s commitment to modernizing health care delivery, advancing digital health transformation, and ensuring medically ready forces. The VMOC, aligned with the DHA’s strategic priorities and the Military Health System’s Ready Reliable Care framework, represents one way the MHS is leveraging technology and innovation to deliver on its mission of caring for the joint force and their families—anytime, anywhere, always.

The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.” Safe adoption bolsters readiness For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.
Building the guardrails The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective.
Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.
Critical collaboration Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.","As military medicine embraces artificial intelligence and digital technology, top Department of War health leaders stressed that strong governance is critical to safely drive innovation to adopt these tools that improve patient outcomes and drive increased military readiness.

During the Defense Health Information Technology Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee, in August 2025, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for health affairs and Ms. Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of war for health services policy and oversight, provided insight into how governance ensures the Military Health System is digitally enabled, safe, interoperable, and aligned with warfighter mission readiness.

Ferrara underscored governance is what translates technology into real outcomes, saying, “We need to deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled and globally partnered system of readiness and health care … where a medic in CENTCOM can consult a trauma specialist at Walter Reed in seconds.”

Digital Health AI policies, particularly the use and governance of AI, is an area Dr. Ferrara has asked that Orsega prioritize.

“We've got to be prepared for the ever-changing warfare ecosystem,” Orsega said. “It is imperative to be integrating and to be interoperable in those digital health spaces, so that we have those tools from either the battlefield to the bedside.”

Governance is foundationally essential to keep up with rapidly evolving AI, she said, for “the scale, the challenges, the demand, the clear priorities, and policies to focus ourselves strategically, enhancing the operational efficiencies … and looking at the readiness of the force.”

The MHS has established guardrails to ensure the use of AI and other advanced tools are implemented responsibly through the MHS Digital Policy Council, launched in March 2025. In her recent appointment as the chair, Orsega cited the policy as assurance that technology, data, and AI efforts are aligned and governed across the MHS “by streamlining digital priorities, reducing redundancies, and focusing on health data as a readiness tool.”

“The digital policy council is intended to ensure that we take a look at, not pull down, the redundancies,” she said. “At the same time, we want to ensure that we have horizontal synergy across all the services.”

Orsega provided an example of a large organization’s diagnostic oncology AI tool as an essential lesson learned in the need for oversight. The AI system once promised to revolutionize cancer care, but it often produced unsafe or irrelevant recommendations. “The clinicians could not rely on that piece of the AI tool to make clear decisions,” she said.

The failure, she said, was not the technology itself but the absence of efficient oversight, as the tool needed stronger governance, infrastructure, and the ability to be audited to ensure better outcomes and reliability.

By contrast, she pointed to the Cleveland Clinic’s Digital Health Playbook as a guide that provides clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and processes for using digital tools. The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.”

Safe adoption bolsters readiness

For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.

“We’re focused on a mission that cuts across so many sectors — delivering smarter, integrated, data-driven health care for service members and their families,” said Ferrara. “It’s more than a technical conversation; it’s an operational imperative.”

He highlighted the full deployment of MHS GENESIS, the electronic health record that provides a single health record for service members, veterans, and family members, as a digital foundation to readiness.

“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical records to follow them from basic training to the battlefield, and ultimately home, and soon to the VA in one smooth, uninterrupted flow,” Ferrara explained.

With MHS GENESIS in place, Ferrara said the MHS is investing in AI-powered support for PTSD, suicide risk, and traumatic brain injury. He also emphasized that oversight is critical: “It’s not merely about adopting new technologies, but how we strategically integrate them into our workflows to improve patient outcomes and ultimately bolster the readiness of our fighting force,” he said.

Building the guardrails

The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective. Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.

Orsega outlined four areas where the council provided this much-needed governance stability:

• Policy and process: Tie AI tools to accountability

• Inclusive expertise: Support of clinicians, scientists, and technologists in the room together

• Audit platforms, data integrity, and infrastructure: Foundation for safe use

• Training: Certify health care professionals can use AI tools responsibly.

Critical collaboration

Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.

“None of this work can succeed in silos,” Ferrara said. “Our public-private partnerships are essential, not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly.”

Orsega added that governance extends beyond the Department of War. NATO’s Committee of Chiefs of Military Medical Services, she noted, is already examining digital transformation, biotech, and decision-support systems in multi-domain operations. Collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies is equally critical.

She stressed the importance of preparing “for that ever-changing ecosystem, either homeland or abroad, and it's our battle cry to ensure that we have those right tools, so that we have the right policies and processes and standards in place,” noting that if there is an urgent need to use digital tools, “we feel really comfortable and confident that our tools are reliable and that they're laser precise for that decision in that moment.”

Orsega concluded by encouraging attendees of DHITS — comprised of government, military, and industry health care information technology professionals — “to be a part of the solution.”

“We have a unique opportunity to confront the challenges that lie ahead and to take that bold initiative.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9290504/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-15 17:56:08.019100

The 59th Medical Wing hosted a demonstration of SimX’s Virtual Reality Operational Medical Training at Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, giving leaders and educators a chance to explore how immersive technology could support medical readiness.

The SimX system, known as VALOR (Virtual Advancement of Learning and Operational Readiness), offers a variety of scenarios designed for military medicine. With only a headset and laptop, medics can train individually or in teams in fully immersive environments that simulate battlefield trauma, prolonged casualty care, aeromedical evacuation, chemical or biological incidents, and even K-9 trauma cases.

Unlike traditional training that relies on mannequins or staged events, the VR system allows for quick setup, repetition and customization. Trainers can replicate operational stressors such as noise or low light and adjust the complexity of scenarios in real time.

Col. Tracy Bozung, 59th Medical Wing deputy commander, took part in the demo and said the event offered valuable perspective.

“This system gives our personnel the opportunity to experience operational medical scenarios in a way that is hard to replicate in traditional training,” Bozung said. “By exploring emerging technologies like virtual reality, we can better understand what options may be available to support readiness in the future.”

She added that keeping an open mind to new tools is part of the wing’s approach to innovation.

“The 59th Medical Wing has always been at the forefront of medical readiness and innovation,” Bozung said. “Looking at capabilities such as VR helps ensure we remain prepared for the environments our Airmen may face, whether in combat operations, humanitarian response, or future missions we can’t yet imagine.”

The 59th Medical Wing, the Air Force’s largest medical wing, supports more than 900,000 outpatient visits annually while preparing medical Airmen for global operations.

Lt. Col. Alidan Bangura, chief of the 59th Medical Wing’s Division of Education and Training, said the demo helped broaden the conversation about potential training tools.

“With systems like the SimX platform, our medics can engage in realistic simulations that cover every phase of patient care—starting from point of injury and extending all the way to evacuation,” explained Bangura. “These immersive, high-pressure scenarios are designed to replicate the intense situations encountered in real-life operations. As a result, this training regimen not only reinforces essential individual medical skills but also greatly enhances team coordination. Both elements are vital for achieving mission success and ensuring the safety and well-being of those we serve.”

The demonstration also highlighted how VR could address common training challenges such as scheduling, equipment requirements and access to specialized facilities. The 59th Medical Wing will continue evaluating whether virtual reality could complement existing programs.
