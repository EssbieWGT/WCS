Although most respiratory illnesses share common symptoms, the flu is more serious than the common cold. It can lead to hospitalization and even death in severe cases. Flu season generally runs through fall and winter, and one of the best things you can do to protect your health is get a flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the flu vaccine for all people aged 6 months and older (with rare exceptions).

“There are multiple benefits to getting the flu vaccine,” said Jeannine Pickrell, MS, RN, Population Health, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Not only are you taking precautions to keep yourself healthy during the fall and winter months, but you’re also taking steps to protect the community, including family and loved ones.”

Learn how to get your TRICARE-covered flu vaccine today.

When is the best time to get vaccinated?

Generally, September and October are the best months to get the flu vaccine. Getting it too early can limit the effectiveness of the vaccine. However, getting the vaccine later in the flu season still has benefits, since the virus will still be circulating. Flu season usually peaks in February and can continue into May.

According to the CDC, there are some populations who are at higher risk for having complications from the flu. It’s especially important for people in these groups to get the flu vaccine. This group includes:

People aged 65 and older

People with certain chronic medical conditions

Pregnant women

Children younger than 5 years old (and especially children under 2)

Additionally, if you’re a health care worker or live with populations who are at high risk for flu complications, it’s important to get vaccinated.

What version of the vaccine should I get?

There are many different versions of the flu vaccine. Which one you should get depends on your age, health conditions, and preferences. Consult with your provider to determine which version of the vaccine is best for you.

Where can I get vaccinated?

There are three ways you can get these vaccines at no cost, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider (like a doctor or nurse practitioner) gives you a vaccine at a participating pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

Note: Before getting the vaccine, call to check if you need an appointment and if the vaccine is available. Remember to bring your Uniformed Services ID card.

Recognizing flu symptoms

The most common flu symptoms include:

Fever

Cough

Sore throat

Runny or stuffy nose

Body aches

Tiredness

You can have the flu before symptoms appear, so getting vaccinated can help prevent you from getting the most prominent strains of the influenza virus. Even if you do get sick, the symptoms may be less severe if you’ve received a flu vaccine.

Other steps to prevent spreading the flu include:

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick

Covering coughs and sneezes

Washing your hands often

Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth

If you do get sick, it’s important to stay home until you’ve been fever-free for 24 hours and your symptoms are improving.

Talk to your provider if you have questions about vaccines. For more information on TRICARE’s vaccine coverage, check out Immunizations.

Therapies were limited and providers often didn’t accept Tricare, the Defense Department health insurance plan for military families.

Air Force Master Sgt. Jason and Latoya Singleton arrived at Yokota four years ago with their son, Jasir, who is on the autism spectrum.

They quickly learned how difficult navigating the Exceptional Family Member Program can be overseas, Latoya Singleton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 17 at Yokota’s Yujo Community Center. Therapies were limited and providers often didn’t accept Tricare, the Defense Department health insurance plan for military families.

The Singletons pieced together therapies in Tokyo, often paying out of pocket. Over time, they became the “go-to” family for others seeking guidance, she said.

“We were literally paying everything out of pocket for all his therapies,” she said. “Eventually, therapists started referring new families to us and saying, ‘This is the family you want to talk to.’”

This spring, Singleton created Yokota Thrives, a network of nearly 50 families that share resources and push for inclusive base events.

“I wanted to open up a community where people could feel safe,” she said. “There’s still a stigma in the military, especially overseas, that if your child has autism you’ll automatically get sent back. That’s not true. There are a lot of kids here, and they still need resources.”

Kristi Forbes, a registered nurse at Yokota Middle School, said her son has non-verbal learning disability, a new diagnosis not officially on the autism spectrum. She often seeks advice on Yokota Thrives’ Facebook page.

“The group has been very helpful because even though it’s not the same diagnosis that most of the parents are dealing with, there’s a lot of similarities,” she said by phone on Sept. 19.

In the first Defense Department survey across the EFMP between November 2022 and March 2023, only 43% of enrolled members said their families’ needs were “largely met,” while 17% reported they weren’t met at all.

For parents overseas, the hurdles multiply.

“When we first got here, [Applied Behavior Analysis] therapy wasn’t available at all,” Singleton said. “We were driving an hour and a half into Tokyo and paying out of pocket. Now there’s a provider that takes Tricare, so that’s a big improvement.”

Yokota Thrives is pushing for sensory-friendly hours at the library and swimming pool, adjusted lighting at events and better advertisement of EFMP programs, she said. During a July 24 spouses’ luncheon with 374th Airlift Wing commander Col. Richard McElhaney, Singleton discussed her ideas with him and other leaders.

“I talked to them about it, and they were like, ‘You know, that’s a good idea. You know, this is something that we should look into.’”

Later, she met with the Force Support Squadron and EFMP representatives to discuss her overall vision.

“They told me, ‘Our spaces are already EFMP-friendly,’” she said. “But just because the physical space is there doesn’t mean the social aspect works for our kids.”

The USO, for example, gave Yokota Thrives the first hour of its Aug. 20 Summer Splash as a sensory-friendly option. Neurodivergent children played outside with bubble makers and water guns or painted and customized shirts.

“USO cares about all military families,” USO event coordinator Amber Laughton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 19. “We try our best to do whatever we can do to create that inclusive space and environment.

The Singletons expect Yokota Thrives to continue thriving after they depart Yokota in March.

“Even if there are no events, I want it to continue to be a safe space. A place where you can go for resources,” Latoya Singleton said. “The biggest thing is inclusion, not just existing.”",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/57qnx1-071125yokota-thrivesphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/071125YOKOTA-THRIVESphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-06 09:00:38.933279

Because it’s the only service that guarantees same-day legal marriage and instant recognition for TRICARE, BAH, and all military benefits.","💍 Introduction: The Power of a Recognized Marriage

For active-duty and reserve military members, marriage isn’t only a personal commitment — it’s the key to unlocking essential protections and benefits. From TRICARE health coverage to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), DEERS registration, and SGLI spousal coverage, everything begins once your marriage is recognized by the Department of Defense (DoD).

However, not all marriages are recognized equally.

While Utah’s online marriage system has become a popular way to marry remotely, the DoD does not automatically accept virtual ceremonies where one or both spouses are not physically present.

If you want your marriage to be instantly valid for military benefits, the safest, fastest, and most reliable choice is a same-day, in-person legal marriage in California through Get Married Today.

🪖 Why Military Recognition Is So Important

Military benefits are only activated once your marriage is recorded in DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System). That enrollment allows:

TRICARE healthcare to start

BAH payments to increase

Base housing and dependent privileges

Spousal ID card issuance

Access to family support programs

If your marriage is not recognized — which can happen with online or proxy ceremonies — all these benefits are delayed or denied until you provide proof that the marriage is consummated.

Utah’s system allows couples to apply online and hold a video ceremony anywhere in the world. While legal under state law, it does not satisfy the DoD’s physical presence rule.

The Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1000.25 explicitly states that, for DEERS and benefits eligibility:

“Both parties must be physically present at the ceremony, or the marriage must be consummated after the ceremony to be recognized.”

That means:

If you marry online and haven’t physically met afterward, your marriage will not count for DEERS or TRICARE.

Proof of consummation must be provided (travel records, photos, affidavits, etc.) before benefits begin.

For service members about to deploy, this can be a serious setback.

✅ The California Advantage: Same-Day Recognition

When you get married through Get Married Today, you meet every federal and military requirement instantly.

California marriages are performed in person, ensuring:

🪖 Real Case Example

A U.S. Army soldier stationed at Fort Irwin married online via Utah. When he tried to add his spouse to DEERS, the application was held for “proof of consummation.” His spouse couldn’t get TRICARE for nearly two months.

A fellow service member completed a same-day, in-person marriage through Get Married Today in California and enrolled his spouse in DEERS the next day — benefits were active by the end of the week.

The difference? Physical presence.

🌎 Benefits of Apostilled California Marriage Certificates

If you or your spouse are abroad, Get Married Today can provide a California-issued marriage certificate apostilled through Orange County Apostille, ensuring validity in over 120 countries under The Hague Convention.

This is essential for:

For military couples, a legal marriage isn’t just about love — it’s about security, stability, and access to benefits that protect both spouses. Health care through TRICARE, housing through BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing), and family recognition through DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) are all tied directly to your marital status.

But not all marriages are recognized equally by the U.S. military.

While Utah’s online marriage system has made headlines for being fast and fully virtual, many service members are finding out too late that a virtual ceremony doesn’t automatically qualify for military benefits.

This guide explains why, under Department of Defense policy, Utah’s online marriages can cause delays or denials in DEERS, TRICARE, and BAH — and why Get Married Today in California offers the only guaranteed path to full and immediate recognition.

⚖️ What Is a Utah Online Marriage?

Utah County allows couples to get married entirely online — no travel required. You can apply for a license and have an officiant marry you via video conference. It’s quick, affordable, and legally valid under U.S. state law.

For civilian couples, this is often a convenient option. The certificate is valid for name changes, taxes, and even immigration.

However, the military follows a separate recognition standard, and that’s where problems begin.

🪖 The Military’s Legal Standard for Recognizing Marriages

According to DoD Instruction 1000.25 and 1341.2, the military will only recognize a marriage if it is legally valid in the jurisdiction where it took place and both parties were physically present at the ceremony.

Proxy or virtual marriages — even if legal under state law — require proof of consummation before they’re recognized for:

DEERS enrollment

TRICARE health coverage

BAH payments

Military ID card issuance

Overseas dependent sponsorship

This means that a marriage performed online, where neither spouse was physically together, isn’t valid for benefits until consummation occurs and can be proven.

⚠️ Real-World Consequences for Service Members

Many service members discover these rules only after applying for benefits:

TRICARE Denials: The spouse isn’t added to the system until physical presence is proven.

Delayed BAH: Payments are withheld because the marriage is under review.

Command Issues: Units may require additional affidavits or proof.

Stress and Financial Strain: Couples lose months of housing pay and coverage.

For couples preparing for deployment, these delays can create serious hardship.

💒 The California Advantage — In-Person Marriage with Get Married Today

In California, Get Married Today performs fully legal, in-person marriages that meet every DoD requirement for immediate recognition.

When both spouses are physically present, the marriage certificate is automatically valid for:

DEERS Enrollment

TRICARE Activation

BAH and Dependent Pay

SGLI Beneficiary Updates

Command Recognition and Housing Access

You walk away the same day with proof of marriage — ready to update your records on base without delay.

⚡ How Get Married Today Simplifies the Entire Process

Instant Marriage License: Issued on-site by a California Deputy Commissioner of Civil Marriages.

Same-Day Legal Ceremony: In-person and compliant with DoD rules.

Immediate Proof: You leave with documentation to enroll your spouse in DEERS.

Certified Copies: Ready for TRICARE and finance offices within days.

Apostille Option: For overseas commands or foreign spouses.

This process ensures zero risk of rejection or benefit delays.

✈️ Why This Matters for Deployed or Stationed Military Members

If you’re preparing for deployment, you don’t have time for administrative delays. A Utah online marriage may require weeks of review and additional proof, while a California in-person marriage is recognized instantly.

That means your spouse’s healthcare, housing, and dependent status are secured before you leave.

📜 Department of Defense Policies Explained

Key DoD References:

DoDI 1000.25 – Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)

DoDI 1341.2 – BAH and Dependent Pay Policies

These instructions state that a marriage must be legally valid under state law and involve physical presence. The requirement exists to prevent fraud and ensure documentation integrity across all branches.

🧭 Comparison Chart

🌍 Common Scenarios

Scenario 1: Overseas Military Member

A deployed service member marries online through Utah but can’t add their spouse to DEERS until returning home — months later.

Scenario 2: Active-Duty Couple in California

They complete their marriage through Get Married Today in person. They submit proof to DEERS the next morning — benefits start within 72 hours.

Scenario 3: Mixed Nationality Couple

A U.S. service member and foreign partner marry with Get Married Today and apostille the certificate the same day for use abroad.

The good news? The TRICARE Dental Program covers emergency dental care, as noted in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook. You’ll pay no cost-share for emergency dental services, no matter your pay grade or location.

“In any emergency, it’s important to act quickly,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency. “With a bit of preparation and knowledge, you can do your best to keep any damage to a minimum.”

Keep reading to learn how to prepare for dental emergencies and what to do when they happen.

What is a dental emergency?

A dental emergency requires immediate attention. You need emergency care if you have:

Bleeding that won’t stop

Pain that doesn’t get better with medication

Broken facial bones

Painful swelling in or around your mouth

Gum infection with pain or swelling

Knocked out or broken tooth

How to prepare

Keep your dentist’s contact information with you at all times. Many dentists have emergency numbers you can call after business hours.

Build a dental emergency kit with these items:

Cotton balls and swabs

Dental floss

Dental mirror

Latex or vinyl gloves

Salt

Cold compress

What to do

Call your dentist first. This is the most important step in any dental emergency. If you don’t have a dentist, use the Find a Dentist tool or go to an urgent care center or emergency room.

For severe tooth pain

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Use dental floss to remove any stuck food.

Apply a cold compress to the outside of your mouth if you have swelling.

Take over-the-counter pain relievers.

For a cracked or broken tooth

Save any broken pieces and rinse them.

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Apply gauze to bleeding areas for 10 minutes.

Use a cold compress on the outside of your mouth to reduce pain and swelling.

For a knocked-out tooth

Find the tooth and hold it by the crown.

Rinse the root gently with water.

Try to put the tooth back in its socket if possible.

If you can’t put it back, place it in a small container of milk or salt water.

See your dentist within one hour for the best chance of saving the tooth.

For mouth bleeding

Rinse with mild salt water.

Press a damp gauze on the bleeding spot for 15-20 minutes.

Hold a cold compress on the outside of your mouth for 5-10 minutes.

If bleeding persists, go to the emergency room immediately.

When it’s not an emergency

Some dental problems can wait for a regular appointment:

Mild toothache

Small chip or crack

Broken braces (unless bleeding)

Something stuck between teeth

Minor cuts or sores

If you seek emergency dental care, but your dentist determines it’s not an emergency, you’ll pay the cost-shares for the care you receive.

For these issues, call your dentist to schedule an appointment during normal hours.

Emergency room or dentist?

For most dental emergencies like broken or knocked-out teeth, your dentist will treat you in his or her office. Go to the emergency room for serious injuries like broken facial bones.

Emergency rooms can give you pain medication and antibiotics, but they don’t do dental work like fillings or crowns. You’ll still need to see your dentist as soon as possible.

Dental emergencies need quick action. The faster you get help, the better your chances of saving your teeth and avoiding additional problems later. Remember:

Call your dentist.

Follow first aid steps until you can get professional care.

Don’t wait, prompt treatment prevents infection and tooth loss.

Koper spent 32 years in uniform, all of it in the Ohio Air National Guard. Before retiring in 1996, he led the first Ohio Air Guard visit to the Republic of Hungary, the state’s State Partnership Program partner.

During his time at NGAUS, the association secured congressional approval of low-cost TRICARE Reserve Select medical coverage for most drill-status Guardsmen.

Koper also launched the effort to correct an oversight in the original language of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Initially, it did not include benefits for those serving on active duty during the Global War on Terrorism in a Title 32 status service.

And he was at association’s controls when Congress approved a fourth star for National Guard Bureau chief.

Retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the current NGAUS president, began his 15 years on the association board near the end of Koper’s time in the position.

“He was a tireless, passionate advocate for the National Guard in the 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia,” McGinn said. “He was a great role model for all of us who have had the privilege of following him.”

Koper was also a member of the National Guard Educational Foundation’s Legion de Lafayette, which is reserved for large benefactors of the foundation, McGinn noted.

Before coming to NGAUS, he served as executive director of the Ohio National Guard Association from 1995 to 2004 and as president of the National Guard Executive Directors Association in 2000.

In 2006, he received the Colonel James F. Gamble Award, NGEDA’s highest honor for support

of the member states and activities.

Also successful in business, he was the president of S. K. Graphics Inc., a print consulting and brokerage firm. He also did a stint as a director and subsequently chairman of the Printing Industries Association of Southern Ohio.

The FDA's input endorses BiomX’s progression of its phage therapy for DFIs as the next clinical application, building on the prior Phase 2 study of BX211, which targeted diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) linked to S. aureus.

The focus on DFI is driven by three main factors: a larger patient base with unfulfilled medical needs, substantial commercial potential, and a distinct regulatory route informed by established FDA guidelines. As both DFI and DFO involve the S. aureus pathogen, DFI is positioned as the initial indication for regulatory approval before exploring further DFO development. BX011 is composed of multiple proprietary phages, including those assessed in the BX211 study.

Approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from U.S. Defense Health Agency and the Department of Navy supports BiomX's efforts. Moving forward, further development of BX011 will align with dialogues with the U.S. Defense Health Agency and depend on financial resources to commence a Phase 2a trial in DFIs. The FDA has provided a clear path for a potential Biologics License Application, with no additional non-clinical studies required, affirming BiomX’s manufacturing and quality strategies.

Company Overview and Market Position

BiomX Inc is engaged in developing both natural and engineered phage cocktails and personalized treatments designed to target and destroy harmful bacteria in chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and diabetic foot osteomyelitis. It discovers and validates proprietary bacterial targets and customizes phage compositions against these targets, applying its BOLT (BacteriOphage Lead to Treatment) platform. The company operates within the Healthcare sector, specifically in the Biotechnology industry, with a market capitalization of approximately $11.25 million.

Financial Health Analysis

BiomX's financial health presents several challenges:

Revenue growth remains stagnant with zero revenue reported, indicating a focus on development rather than commercialization.

Profitability metrics are concerning, with a negative EPS of -1.01 and a ROE of -69.73%.

The balance sheet shows a current ratio of 2.66, indicating adequate liquidity, but the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.49 suggests moderate leverage.

Valuation and Market Sentiment

BiomX's valuation metrics reflect its distressed status:

The P/B ratio stands at 21.19, indicating a high valuation relative to book value.

Technical indicators show a RSI-14 of 35.83, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory.

Institutional ownership is at 35.28%, with minimal insider activity, reflecting cautious market sentiment.

Income has also been cut off for some dual-income military families.
That means doctors, therapists, and medical offices treating military families are now forced to wait for reimbursement.
Military families sacrifice stability, predictability, and support systems so their loved ones can serve the nation.
Through her social media and nonprofit work, she supports caregivers, disabled individuals, and military families.","As the federal government shutdown continues, much of the national conversation has centered on one question: will service members miss a paycheck? But for military families, it’s so much more than just a possible missed paycheck. For many families, especially junior enlisted households and those caring for medically complex children, the shutdown is proving to be a destabilizing event touching every part of life at once.

Active duty service members are still required to report to duty without any guarantee that the next paycheck will arrive in full or on time. Already, families have reported partial and incorrect pay during the shutdown, in some cases short by hundreds or thousands of dollars. This would be stressful for any American household, and for military families, it comes on top of unique pressures tied to service. Many military families operate on a single income due to frequent moves, deployments, child care challenges, and gaps in support, making consistent employment nearly impossible for spouses. Essential expenses often consume most of their income and make it nearly impossible to build savings, even when budgeting responsibly. Nearly 25% of military households have less than $500 in savings, which leaves little to handle unexpected expenses or financial strain during a shutdown. Income has also been cut off for some dual-income military families. More than 16,000 military spouses are employed by the federal government. When their paychecks pause along with uncertainty around military pay, families are finding themselves with two income streams at risk. It’s especially difficult for families who are already stretched thin, with almost no financial cushion.

Even in typical circumstances one in four military families experience food insecurity and the shutdown is making it worse. A late, reduced, or missed paycheck can lead to parents having to choose between bills and feeding their kids. About 23,000 active duty military households depend on programs like SNAP to help feed their children. While two judges have ordered SNAP contingency funds to be released, families will still face significant delays due to states needing time to receive and process the money and with only a portion of the necessary funding currently available, many households may receive reduced or partial benefits. These are households juggling service, sacrifice, deployments, unpredictable schedules, and the daily demands of raising children while one parent serves the nation. No military family should ever have to worry about whether they can afford groceries.

Healthcare access has also become more uncertain during the shutdown. Coverage through TRICARE continues, but TRICARE has stated that payments to medical providers may be delayed until funding is restored. That means doctors, therapists, and medical offices treating military families are now forced to wait for reimbursement. Some offices have already begun warning families that they may pause services, stop accepting TRICARE, or limit new appointments if the shutdown continues. For military families with medically complex children or loved ones who depend on regular therapies, specialty care, or consistent medical support, even the threat of service interruptions is deeply unsettling. Military pharmacies have begun to experience medication shortages or limited stock, forcing families to fill prescriptions at civilian pharmacies where co-pays apply. Families who normally pay nothing for essential medication have suddenly faced hundreds of dollars in unexpected costs. For children with rare diseases, seizure disorders, respiratory conditions, or other complex needs, medication consistency is a matter of safety, stability, and in some cases, survival. Junior enlisted families, already living on tight budgets, are being forced into impossible choices between medical necessity and what they can realistically afford.

Child care is being hit too. Some base child development centers have already reduced hours or closed certain services during the shutdown, and programs like Head Start are facing funding deadlines that could shut classrooms if this continues. For military families, child care is what allows spouses to work and what holds routines together during deployments and long duty days, it’s what gives medically complex kids and their sibling’s stability and support. And now, with financial uncertainty growing by the day, many families can’t even afford backup or civilian child care options if base care is limited or unavailable. Without child care, parents are left scrambling, jobs are put at risk, and families lose one more layer of stability they rely on.

Housing and relocation are under strain as well. Military families in the middle of permanent change-of-station (PCS) moves are reporting delays in travel approvals, shipment schedules, and on base housing processing due to the shutdown. This is forcing families into extended temporary lodging, prolonged housing overlap, and uncertainty about when their children can enroll in school at their next duty station. On top of the emotional and logistical stress, many families are fronting thousands of dollars in PCS costs and now face delayed reimbursements because of the shutdown, leaving them vulnerable to debt during an already difficult transition.

All of this uncertainty takes a toll on mental health. Military spouses report rising anxiety, stress, and emotional exhaustion. Spouses who are already carrying the load alone during deployments or long duty hours are stretched even further. Service members feel the strain too, especially those serving away from home who have to watch their families struggle without being able to step in and help. The emotional weight ultimately travels with them into their work, affecting focus, readiness, and overall well-being. This is a force readiness issue.

Government shutdowns are often framed as a political impasse or administrative pause. But inside military homes, it looks very different. It looks like a parent desperately calling multiple pharmacies to find seizure medication and hope they can afford it. It looks like a young family calculating whether they can afford groceries and gas in the same week. It looks like a child missing essential therapy sessions because TRICARE may not pay on time. It looks like a spouse refreshing the bank account at midnight hoping the pay processed correctly. It looks like a service member thousands of miles away worrying about whether their family back home can meet their basic needs.

Military families sacrifice stability, predictability, and support systems so their loved ones can serve the nation. They move frequently, endure separations, and stretch budgets that are often already strained. They shouldn’t be pushed into crisis because political leaders fail to work together to fund the basic functions of government.

This shutdown is a cascading threat to financial security, food access, medication continuity, mental health, educational stability, and family readiness. The longer it continues, the higher the cost, not only to military households but also to the force and to national security itself.

Ok I’ll help. 45 minutes would be 3 units. And yes, bill like Medicare timed codes. If the patient only has Tricare, it may be different, but Tricare is a federal government plan, so I think it would be the same billing rules. I see a lot of Medicare with Tricare as secondary, so I follow Medicare billing rules. I’m assuming this company wants you to bill 4 codes and not 3, but that would require you to spend more time to meet the time parameters set by Medicare. Look up the insurance providers in your state to see the type of billing required, but I’m pretty sure you bill as if it was Medicare. Remember it’s your license at stake. Don’t let the company push you into fraudulent billing practice. Best of luck to you.

Physical therapy is a dynamic field that is constantly evolving with new techniques and technologies. Here are some of the innovative techniques and approaches that are making a significant impact in physical therapy:

Exoskeletons for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)

Exoskeletons are advanced robotic devices that help individuals with SCI regain mobility and perform daily activities. These devices provide support and assistance, allowing patients to stand, walk, and even climb stairs. ""Exoskeletons for SCI are making crazy advances which is promising.""

Ultrasound-Guided Dry Needling

Dry needling is a technique that involves inserting thin needles into trigger points in the muscle to relieve pain and improve muscle function. Ultrasound guidance ensures precise placement of the needles, enhancing the effectiveness and safety of the procedure. ""Ultrasound guided dry needling""

Shockwave Therapy

Shockwave therapy uses acoustic waves to stimulate healing in tissues. It is being used to treat various conditions, including tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, and even arthritis, with promising results. ""Europe is doing shockwave for some injuries and arthritis and its showing some good results.""

3D Printing for Adaptive Equipment

3D printing is revolutionizing the creation of custom adaptive equipment, reducing costs and improving accessibility. This includes printing custom-fit braces, prosthetics, and other assistive devices. ""3D printing DME and other costly materials, that would in hope lower the cost by cutting out the middleman.""

Remote Patient Monitoring

Remote patient monitoring allows physical therapists to track their patients' progress and provide guidance from a distance. This is particularly useful for patients in rural areas or those with limited access to clinics. ""So much remote patient monitoring.""

AI in EMR and Treatment Planning

AI is being integrated into electronic medical records (EMR) and treatment planning tools to improve efficiency and accuracy. It can help in diagnosing conditions, recommending exercises, and even providing real-time feedback on performance. ""AI will become more prominent in EMR and other platforms.""

Aquatic Therapy

Aquatic therapy utilizes the buoyancy of water to reduce the load on joints, making it easier for patients to perform exercises. It is particularly beneficial for individuals with conditions like dysautonomia and POTS. ""I had a really positive experience with aquatic therapy.""

Vestibular Exercises

Vestibular exercises are designed to improve balance and reduce dizziness by retraining the brain to process signals from the inner ear correctly. ""My daily dizziness has improved. We talked about moving onto a POTs program which I guess entails equipment such as a recumbent bike.""

Schroth Method for Scoliosis

The Schroth Method is a specialized physical therapy approach for scoliosis that focuses on correcting spinal alignment through specific exercises and breathing techniques. ""I went to pt for over a year with no tangible improvements. Finally started paying for schroth and my pain has definitely decreased""

Motivational Interviewing

Motivational interviewing is a communication technique used by physical therapists to help patients take ownership of their rehabilitation and improve compliance with home exercise programs. ""Motivational interviewing has been a fantastic tool to improve compliance for my patients.""
