Some — but not all — TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for weight management.
But as Wegovy, insurance plans typically only cover it for weight loss.
How to get approved for Wegovy If your TRICARE healthcare plan does not initially cover Wegovy, you still have a few options for getting approved.
If TRICARE will not cover Wegovy for you, consider enrolling in a clinical trial for Wegovy.","Approximately 4 in 10 U.S. adults have obesity. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes, but there are also drug treatments like Wegovy (semaglutide), an injectable GLP-1 medication that is FDA-approved for chronic weight management due to its effectiveness in lowering blood sugar and decreasing appetite.

Like most brand-name prescription drugs, Wegovy isn’t cheap. Many patients wonder if health insurance will help offset their out-of-pocket costs. There’s no definitive answer because insurance coverage depends on your specific health plan. Here’s what you should know about Wegovy coverage if you have a policy from TRICARE, the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program for active duty and retiree service members, some National Guard and Reserve members, and their eligible family members.

Does TRICARE cover Wegovy?

Some — but not all — TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for weight management. According to the TRICARE website, coverage depends on whether your reason for taking Wegovy meets certain criteria and if you have a prescription from a licensed medical provider. TRICARE coverage of Wegovy typically requires prior authorization unless you are also taking other medications for diabetes management.

Reason for taking Wegovy

With the same active ingredient as Ozempic – semaglutide – Wegovy effectively lowers blood sugar. But as Wegovy, insurance plans typically only cover it for weight loss. This brand-name form of semaglutide is not approved for treating diabetes.

However, semaglutide injections, such as Ozempic, are FDA-approved for blood sugar control in Type 2 diabetes. TRICARE is much more likely to cover Ozempic for a person with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, though coverage still depends on the plan.

Getting a prescription from a licensed provider

TRICARE coverage for Wegovy also requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider.

Michelle Lin, DO, a board-certified doctor of osteopathy at My Family Doc in Las Vegas, Nevada, describes her approach to prescribing obesity drugs: “If the patient is overweight to any degree with failure of diet and exercise, or has the inability to exercise plus metabolic disease, inflammatory musculoskeletal flares, and pain related to carrying more weight, I would consider prescribing Wegovy.”

Prior authorization

Finally, TRICARE requires your healthcare provider to complete a prior authorization form for Wegovy. Prior authorization is a process intended to determine a drug’s medical necessity. In the form, your provider must provide reasoning for why Wegovy is necessary. If TRICARE approves the prior authorization, your Wegovy will be covered. If not, you may need to pay for Wegovy out of pocket.

According to the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), the 2024 TRICARE prior authorization requirements stated that adult patients must meet the following criteria:

Have a body mass index (BMI) of >30 or a BMI of at least 27 with weight-related risk factors such as high blood pressure or sleep apnea

Have attempted lifestyle changes, including a reduced-calorie diet, for at least 6 months and still failed to achieve the desired weight loss

Have tried (or are contraindicated to try) another prescription weight loss drug. (Requiring patients to try a lower-cost drug before an expensive brand-name medication is known as step therapy.)

Be committed to lifestyle changes, including a reduced-calorie diet, while on Wegovy

Bottom line: Some TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for eligible enrollees, but there are strict criteria for getting insurance coverage for this particular drug.

How to get approved for Wegovy

If your TRICARE healthcare plan does not initially cover Wegovy, you still have a few options for getting approved.

Send an appeal letter to TRICARE. You can talk to your healthcare provider about ways to state that the drug is medically necessary. Novo Nordisk offers a sample letter that some healthcare providers use as a template. Even if your provider offers to write an appeal letter, you might need to submit the letter to TRICARE yourself.

Enroll in a clinical trial. If TRICARE will not cover Wegovy for you, consider enrolling in a clinical trial for Wegovy. If you qualify for a plan currently enrolling trial participants, you can get Wegovy for free or at a steeply discounted price.

Switch to a different weight loss drug. Saxenda and Zepbound are two Wegovy alternatives that might be covered by insurance. Other GLP-1s like Ozempic and Mounjaro are sometimes prescribed off-label to insurance, though off-label prescriptions are unlikely to be covered by insurance.

How much does Wegovy cost?

Wegovy is a costly weight loss medication. The average retail cost is $1,844 per four injection pen, which is a one-month supply. For people with insurance coverage, the out-of-pocket copay for Wegovy varies by plan. According to MOAA, TRICARE beneficiaries paid about $38 for a 90-day Wegovy supply via home delivery in 2024.

How to check whether your TRICARE plan covers Wegovy

You can check your insurance coverage with this web tool from Novo Nordisk, Wegovy’s manufacturer. You can also use the TRICARE formulary search tool to view the TRICARE formulary (list of covered drugs).

That said, the best way to get a definitive answer about drug coverage is to contact your TRICARE representative. In most cases, you can call the number on the back of your insurance card or prescription card.

While many grieve the loss of their loved ones, there is some good news for those in need of emergency medication.

The Defense Health Agency announced Monday that TRICARE beneficiaries in 21 Texas counties can receive emergency prescription refills through July 17 in flood-impacted regions.

How to obtain emergency refills:

1. Locate a TRICARE retail network

Beneficiaries can locate network pharmacies by calling Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303 or using the network pharmacy locator tool. The agency suggests visiting the pharmacy where the prescription was originally filled when possible, noting that prescriptions filled by retail chains may be filled at other stores within that chain.

If available, beneficiaries can also ask their prescribing clinician to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

2. Bring prescription bottles to your local TRICARE retail network

TRICARE beneficiaries should bring their prescription bottles to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. For those whose bottles are unavailable or have damaged or missing labels, the agency recommends contacting Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

3. Obtain urgent care if possible

The Defense Health Agency reminded beneficiaries that TRICARE members, except active-duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider without requiring a referral. This provision ""allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.""

The agency emphasized that ""any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.""

Beneficiaries are encouraged to check Express Scripts' Weather Notices page for ongoing updates regarding the emergency provisions.

Sullivan, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, today announced that MERCER (US), LLC, a consulting company with an office in Hartford, has entered into a civil settlement agreement and paid more than $450,000 to resolve allegations that it overbilled the Defense Health Agency for work performed by certain employees and subcontractors billed at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels permitted.

The Defense Health Agency (“DHA”) manages TRICARE’s health benefits program for servicemembers and their families. Prior to developing and implementing DHA’s supporting managed care support and pharmacy services contracts, DHA sought subject matter expertise from outside of the Department of Defense to ensure beneficiaries receive high quality care. Specifically, DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support (“HPIS”) services from vendors under the General Services Administration’s (“GSA”) Professional Services Schedule (“PSS”).

In approximately April 2020, DHA and Mercer entered into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (“BPA”) for HPIS services. DHA also awarded HPIS Task 1 to Mercer. Under this task order, Mercer would provide qualified personnel with subject matter expertise relevant to the design of TRICARE programs. The BPA included labor categories that identified the education and experience qualifications, and associated hourly billing rate, for the personnel working under the BPA. Each month, Mercer invoiced DHA for labor expended under the BPA at hourly billing rates commensurate to the employees’ (or subcontractor employees’) designated labor categories and the education and experience associated with those labor categories.

The government contends that, from May 7, 2020, through August 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for the efforts of 11 employees working under the BPA at labor rates for which those employees did not have the requisite educational background or experience levels. Mercer investigated and disclosed to the government these incorrect contract billings. To resolve claims arising under the Contract Disputes Act and the common law theories of breach of contract, payment by mistake, and unjust enrichment, Mercer paid the government $456,796.50.

I’m trying to decide between enlisting in the Air Force Reserves now or waiting to apply to OTS as a civilian reservist. My interest is primarily benefit-driven. Not aiming for a 20-year military career.

Background: • 26 year old, single male (27 this fall)

• BS in telecommunications (non-STEM, 3.3 GPA, some volunteer experience) • Working in tech, earning ~$80K now with potential to hit $150K+ (currently at 5 yrs experience) • Plan to do 6 years in the Reserves (not a full career) • Want to pursue a master’s in electrical/ computer engineering to open future doors (~$20K cost)

My Goals: 1. Use the VA loan to buy to house hack for about ~10 years or so and eventually get my dream house

2. Get a TS/SCI clearance to open up higher-paying defense jobs for long-term job security (tech market is sort of trash still, but I already have 5 years of experience so would like to keep the momentum going in the civilian world) 3. Access TRICARE Reserve Select 4. Use Tuition Assistance to pay for grad school

Options: • Enlist now and possibly submit an OTS packet later → benefits start sooner (school paid for, go on active orders to get access to VA loan quicker, clearance, etc… )

• Wait for OTS → stronger officer app over time, but delay access to VA loan, clearance, TRICARE, (would have to start paying for masters out of pocket or put it on hold until I got in (if that even happens, given how competitive it is for civilians)) (could be 1-3 yrs waiting and I’ll be close to 30 at that point)

Anyone been in a similar spot? Is enlisting smart if I mainly want benefits, not a long-term military career? I’ve heard people say I’ll regret enlisting if I have a degree, but to kickstart benefits immediately it seems like the only way. Appreciate any advice.",,N,0.0,2025-07-07 17:56:15.492465

Lodi, U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command and Defense Health Agency Director for Research and Development commander, welcomed attendees and thanked family members for their support.
She said Summers brings a wealth of medical expertise to USAARL and described him as a transformational leader.
We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community.
“Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff.
Prior to the ceremony, Lodi presented Hoefer with a Legion of Merit medal for his accomplishments during his service at USAARL.","The Fort Rucker community welcomed Col. Thomas A. Summers as U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory commander, and bid farewell to outgoing commander, Col. Matthew H. Hoefer, during a Change of Command ceremony at the U.S. Army Aviation Museum June 25, 2025. Maj. Gen. Paula C. Lodi, U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command and Defense Health Agency Director for Research and Development commander, welcomed attendees and thanked family members for their support. “What USAARL does is truly important, groundbreaking and impressive,” Lodi said. “The audience in attendance is a testament to that.” Lodi recognized senior leaders not only from across the Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Rucker, but also Army Futures Command, other MRDC laboratories, and the surrounding community. She said Summers brings a wealth of medical expertise to USAARL and described him as a transformational leader. “He is known for his rare combination of strengths in strategic planning and operations,” Lodi said. “In addition to being a highly accomplished, highly intelligent, and extremely capable leader, Tom has an innate ability to make all things fun, which is why he is a welcome addition to every assignment.” Summers arrives at USAARL from his most recent duty position as the Assistant Chief of Staff, Support Operation, Medical Readiness Command East and Chief Medical Officer, Defense Health Network East. Among his previous assignments, he served as a Staff Pathologist, Hematopathologist, Pathology Residency Program Faculty, Director of Immunohistochemistry Section, and Director of the Murtha Cancer Center Biobank at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; Brigade Surgeon, 210th Field Artillery Brigade, Camp Casey, ROK; Medical School Faculty, Uniformed Services University; Chief, Department of Pathology, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital; Command Surgeon and Senior Medical Officer, United States Army Cadet Command; and Chief Surgeon, Army Recovery Care Program, MEDCOM G-3/5/7. Summers is a board certified Anatomic and Clinical Pathologist with subspecialty board certification in Hematopathology. He is a Fellow of College of American Pathologists. He holds a Master of Business Administration from Southern Illinois University, a Master of Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College, and is completing a Master of Health Professions Education from the University of Illinois Chicago. Summers is a member of the College of American Pathologists International Accreditation Committee. Summers has been awarded multiple awards and decorations throughout his career plus the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Flight Surgeon Badge, and the Parachutist’s Badge. He welcomed and thanked attendees, family, soldiers, and those who participated in the Change of Command ceremony and made it possible. “Every day,” Summers said as he addressed the USAARL staff, “your research saves lives, improves readiness, and ensures our servicemembers have the best possible protection as they carry out their missions. As we look to the future, I am committed to building upon the strong foundation laid by those who came before me,” he said. “We will continue to foster a culture of scientific rigor, innovation, and teamwork. We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community. Above all, we will never lose sight of our mission,” Summers concluded. Lodi praised Hoefer’s service to the Army and aeromedical research as he prepares to transition to his next assignment as the Medical Corps, Deputy Corps Chief, at Defense Health Headquarters, Falls Church, Va. “As commander, Matt not only led the team to advance USAARL’s mission,” Lodi said, “but also guided the organization through a period of significant transformation and change that accompanied MRDC’s alignment with the Defense Health Agency.” Lodi said Hoefer “is recognized for his calmness under pressure and his forward-thinking management style, as well as his ability to unite diverse teams. Your ability to drive progress will be an asset in your upcoming assignments” Lodi said. “This lab’s future is bright because of your focus on delivering whatever the DOD needs to make our warriors safer, more lethal and more capable on the battlefield,” Hoefer said in a farewell message to USAARL. “Keep innovating, keep looking for new ways to support our teammates, and keep up this great USAARL culture.” Hoefer asked the USAARL staff to stand for a moment during the ceremony. “Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff. “Your work has been essential for aviators over the past 60 years and I’m excited to see what you deliver for Army aviation in the future,” Hoefer said.

For more information on USNH Rota and its mission, visit www.rota.tricare.mil (http://www.rota.tricare.mil/).","ROTA, Spain (June 2, 2025) – In a landmark accomplishment that underscores an enduring commitment to cybersecurity and warfighter readiness, the Information Management Department (IMD) of U.S. Naval Hospital (USNH) Rota has earned the highest possible cybersecurity compliance rating, Maturity Level (ML) 4, following a rigorous assessment by the Cybersecurity Health and Readiness Inspection Program (CHIRP) within the Defense Health Agency (DHA). This elite designation places the hospital among an exclusive cadre of high-performing military treatment facilities (MTFs), becoming only the 4th MTF within the Defense Health Network-Europe and the 8th Navy MTF across the enterprise to achieve this level of cybersecurity maturity.

Earning an ML 4 designation requires expertly managed cybersecurity operations and processes. This means the organization has measured and controlled cybersecurity activities; its systems are data-driven with quantitative performance improvement objectives that are predictable and aligned to all Department of Defense and Defense Health Agency (DHA) guidance, as well as industry best practices.

The IMD team led a months-long, all-hands effort to prepare for the assessment, executing enhanced security protocols, comprehensive system hardening, user education, and remediation of vulnerabilities across the hospital’s digital ecosystem. Their work ensures that health information systems remain secure in the face of evolving cyber threats while maintaining seamless support to operational missions.

“This level of cybersecurity readiness doesn’t happen overnight,” said Lt. Willie Williams, the Information Management Department Head. “It’s the product of disciplined planning, enterprise collaboration, and an uncompromising standard of excellence in protecting our network and the mission it supports.”

The hospital’s strong cybersecurity posture not only protects patient data and medical systems, it directly enables warfighter readiness. By safeguarding the digital infrastructure that supports healthcare delivery, USNH Rota ensures continuity of care during real-world contingencies, keeping service members medically prepared to operate in any environment.

Strategically positioned on the Iberian Peninsula, the hospital plays a critical role in defending, restoring, and elevating the health of warfighters and their families. USNH Rota provides ready, reliable care to 8,400 service members and their families.

Not all providers who take Tricare accept Tricare rates.
And you’ve learned to check the Tricare Provider Directory every time before scheduling anything outside the MTF.
But being the go-to spouse isn’t always sustainable When you’re the one who knows the system, it’s easy to become the person everyone turns to.","Tricare is one of those systems you either kind of understand or absolutely don’t. There’s no in-between. And if you’re one of the unicorn spouses who somehow managed to figure it out? If you’ve navigated MilConnect without rage-quitting, chosen the right plan, locked in a PCM who isn’t deployed, and convinced a provider to actually accept Tricare rates?

You’re it now. You’re the reference point. The urgent care whisperer. The unofficial customer service rep for your entire spouse group.

It usually starts small. You answer one question in the group chat correctly. Or you mention something helpful at a Unit Family Day. Next thing you know, someone’s texting you at 8:42 p.m. to ask whether urgent care visits count toward the deductible under Tricare Select, and you’re explaining how referrals work with all the clarity of someone who never meant to memorize the rules but accidentally did.

You didn’t sign up for this job. But now everyone thinks you work there.

You know the system because it made you learn.

It took you three PCS moves, one misrouted prescription, and two near-screaming matches with an off-base pediatric clinic to finally understand how Tricare actually works. And now you do.

On more than one occasion, you’ve explained the following:

Your coverage lives and dies with DEERS. If it’s not up to date, nothing else works. If your info isn’t correct in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, your kid doesn’t show up in the system and you’re paying out-of-pocket at the pharmacy until it’s fixed. You update DEERS on MilConnect now like it’s a ritual, every move, every baby, every new assignment.

The plans aren’t one-size-fits-all, and no one explains that clearly. You know that Tricare Prime is free but requires referrals for anything more complicated than a sinus infection.

You know that if you’re not near a military treatment facility, Select will give you more control but comes with out-of-pocket costs. You’ve explained the difference at least a dozen times to new spouses who thought “Select” meant “better.”

Guard/Reserve coverage doesn’t just happen. You’ve watched families assume they were covered under Tricare Reserve Select, only to find out (during an emergency, of course) that enrollment requires paperwork and premiums. No one told them. You tell them.

Tricare for Life is a gift but only if you enroll in Medicare Part B on time. You’ve walked one too many retirees through the panic of almost missing that deadline.

The benefits are good if you know how to access them

Your knowledge base for Tricare extends beyond just booking routine appointments. Now you know that:

Express Scripts delivers prescriptions straight to your door for free, and anyone standing in line at the pharmacy on base might be doing it the hard way (unless it’s antibiotics—then you know you’re back in line with the rest of us).

The Nurse Advice Line is your secret weapon when it’s 10 p.m., your kid has a fever, and you don’t know whether you need urgent care, ER, or just Tylenol and a popsicle. It’s open 24/7. Most people don’t even know it exists.

Referrals must go through your PCM, and calling a specialist directly—no matter how well-meaning—is a great way to get hit with an unpaid bill. You’ve now said, “Wait, did you get a referral for that?” more times than you can count.

Not all providers who take Tricare accept Tricare rates. That’s a hard lesson. And you’ve learned to check the Tricare Provider Directory every time before scheduling anything outside the MTF.

You’ve learned the hard way that understanding your plan is the only thing that stands between smooth care and complete chaos.

But being the go-to spouse isn’t always sustainable

When you’re the one who knows the system, it’s easy to become the person everyone turns to. And for a while, that feels good. But eventually, it catches up with you. You find yourself answering questions in the school pickup line, in the commissary aisle, in the middle of your own dental cleaning.

Being generous with your knowledge doesn’t mean making yourself available at all times. You’re allowed to redirect and to say, “I’m not sure, but you can find that on the Tricare site.”

Tricare Group Insurance and Types of Plans

Tricare is the health care program serving United States military members, veterans, and their families. It offers robust insurance coverage, including mental health and substance use services, ensuring that beneficiaries can access essential care when they need it most. Whether you’re active duty, retired, or a family member, Tricare is designed to support your overall wellness—including addressing addiction.

Tricare offers several insurance plan options to cater to different needs. Each plan provides varying levels of coverage, making it essential to understand what’s covered to maximize your benefits. Key Tricare plans include:

Tricare Prime: Available to active-duty members and their families, this plan prioritizes simplicity and comprehensive coverage. As a managed care option, Tricare Prime ensures low out-of-pocket costs while connecting you with primary care managers for coordinated care.

Tricare Select: This flexible plan allows you to choose your own health care providers without requiring referrals. It’s open to military families, retirees, and National Guard members. While out-of-pocket costs can increase compared to Tricare Prime, Tricare Select still offers extensive addiction treatment coverage.

Tricare Reserve Select: Designed for National Guard Reserve members, this option offers affordable monthly premiums for those seeking addiction care.

Tricare Young Adult: A plan specifically available to children of military families aged 21–26, this option extends coverage for addiction treatment to young adults stepping into independence.

Tricare Retired Reserve: Tailored for retired Guard members and reservists not yet eligible for Medicare, this plan provides comprehensive benefits for substance use treatment.

Understanding these plans ensures you’re prepared to seek care at an in-network Tricare detox facility in Boston, MA, such as The Retreat of Boston.

Tricare Addiction Treatment Coverage and Benefits

Tricare’s rehab insurance coverage is extensive, ensuring that beneficiaries can receive necessary care without overwhelming financial barriers. Here’s what to expect:

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT): For individuals battling opioid or alcohol addiction, MAT is a medically supervised approach that combines medications like Suboxone or methadone with therapy. Tricare covers MAT as part of its strategy to address substance use disorders holistically.

Assessment and Testing: Tricare supports initial assessments, diagnostic testing, and routine evaluations to develop personalized treatment plans.

Rehabilitation Services: Detox is just the start. Tricare includes coverage for rehabilitation services, helping individuals build coping strategies and the necessary life skills for long-term sobriety.

Psychiatric and Mental Health Support: Addiction often co-occurs with mental health issues. Counseling, psychiatric care, and treatment for psychological comorbidities are all covered under Tricare.

At The Retreat of Boston, we collaborate with Tricare to ensure that you receive comprehensive care covered by their insurance options for addiction treatment.

What Will My Out-of-Pocket Cost Be With a Tricare Detox in Boston, MA?

Tricare is designed to minimize out-of-pocket expenses for detox and addiction recovery services, especially when you choose an in-network provider like The Retreat of Boston. By working within the Tricare network, beneficiaries often experience significantly reduced costs for medically necessary treatment.

The amount you pay depends on several factors, including your specific Tricare plan type. For instance, Tricare Prime generally offers lower copays and fewer out-of-pocket costs, while Tricare Select may include monthly premiums, deductibles, or coinsurance. It’s also important to understand what’s included in your coverage. While detox services are typically covered, certain therapies or medications—such as medication-assisted treatment or specialized counseling—may require additional verification.

At The Retreat of Boston, we prioritize both affordability and transparency. Our admissions and billing team will work closely with you to review your Tricare benefits, clarify what is and isn’t covered, and provide a clear picture of any potential costs before treatment begins.

We live on base right now and use the base pharmacy for most of my meds.
The base pharmacy here is small and can’t always get my meds quickly so it’s just easier to go off base.
On a side note…needing medical care is not being a “leech”.
You, like everyone else, deserves proper medical care.","There are 2 main levels of tricare: prime and select.

Prime: free if overseas, minimal cost if stateside (someone correct me if I'm wrong). You don't everything through your pcp and need a referral for everything. That can get super annoying/frustrating. The tradeoff is no co-pays ever.

Select: you never need a referral, but there are co-pays. If living stateside, but remote, this is the better option.

As far as diabetic supplies, when I had gestational diabetes, they didn't cover the cost of my glucometer since it's an iver the counter thing, but reading their website, they should cover a cgm if necessary. I also had a copay on insulin and supplies to check my levels. I have select, so that may have been part of the reason.

Tricare is really cheap for insurance (we pay less than $300/months for a family of 5) and the coverage is great for the price. I have never had anything denied that was medically necessary, but i have had it take forever to get approved. I have had to fight to get the doctors I wanted, but they've always been approved in the end. Sometimes you have to do the work for tricare because they dont always update their database of doctors. I was assigned a doctor once that had retired 2 years earlier.

Vision and dental are separate, but still super cheap.

I’m a very high utilizer and can tell you that tricare prime, as long as you have the right referrals and documentation, covers absolutely almost everything and costs us $0 as long as my husband is active duty. Prescriptions filled off base but still within network costs $16. I was medically retired before I married my husband (who is still active duty) and had tricare select. I had a $3000 catastrophic cap and I hit that every year due to my chronic illness.

I am also a type 1 diabetic and 100% of my supplies are available on base, through the pharmacy, with zero cost to me. If you use Express Scripts, the mail order, then there is usually a copay. The only limits when it comes to covered meds is that anything identified as a maintenance medication(diabetic supplies are) is required to be filled on base or through mail order or you have to pay a higher copay. We live on base right now and use the base pharmacy for most of my meds. Our last base I used express scrips.

As I mentioned, I’m a very high utilizer due to my chronic illness and I am in palliative care. I have a large amount of medical supplies and specialty medications that are all fully covered. I do pay a copay for my palliative meds because they’re filled through a local specialty pharmacy. The base pharmacy here is small and can’t always get my meds quickly so it’s just easier to go off base. My medical supplies for my port, tube feeding, IV, etc is all covered 100%. I have a home nurse and aides that are all paid by tricare. My specialists are all covered as long as they’re in network and I’ve never had a hard time finding amazing doctors who take tricare.

Honestly, it sometimes takes some effort but ultimately everything we need has been covered. It’s just about making sure you have the right paperwork and getting it pushed through.

As someone else said, you will also need to enroll in EFMP. It’s a program to insure your spouse isn’t sent to a base that won’t have proper services for you. In your case, needing an endocrinologist will be the requirement so it shouldn’t be a huge issue getting assignments. EFMP is not optional and you do have to enroll but it’s for your benefit.

On a side note…needing medical care is not being a “leech”. Having a chronic illness isn’t a moral failing. You, like everyone else, deserves proper medical care.

If you or anyone else have any questions then I’m absolutely happy to answer from my experience. I’ve been using tricare for my medical care almost my entire life and got sick while I was active duty myself so I’m well versed in what care is available. I’m very lucky to have this and always want to make sure others get the proper care they need too.",,N,0.0,2025-07-05 18:56:19.989413

Yes, Tricare covers HRT which includes TRT with some exclusions. See your Primary Care Manager for a referral if you have Prime. If you have Select you can go to a Specialist without a referral. It depends on how the Specialist decides you need care. If your problem falls under the issues included in the things that are covered then yes, Tricare pays.If its not, they won't.
