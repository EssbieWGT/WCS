Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11) introduced an amendment to the FY2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would repeal the longstanding federal ban on abortion care in the military health system. The amendment strikes Section 1093 of Title X, which prohibits the Department of Defense from providing abortion services in most cases.

Following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, approximately 40% of women in uniform are now stationed in states that ban or severely restrict abortion access. Even the narrow “exceptions” permitted under current law have proven unworkable in practice, putting the lives and health of servicewomen at risk.

Thousands of active-duty servicewomen seek abortion care each year, according to a 2023 RAND report. Yet under current law, military doctors and facilities are prohibited from providing that care, even when it’s medically necessary for their health — forcing women to turn to informal support systems or delay treatment.

The amendment seeks to restore full reproductive health care access for all military personnel and their families, regardless of where they are stationed.

Full remarks, as delivered:

“Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.

Today, across the country, women's reproductive freedoms are under attack. After the Supreme Court’s MAGA majority overturned Roe, nineteen states(link is external) now outright ban or severely restrict abortion access.

My daughters now have less freedoms than I did while growing up. It is unthinkable to me that so many of our servicewomen are already serving with less rights than I had while in the Navy and being stationed in states like Texas or Florida without basic access to reproductive care.

The fact that our military treatment facilities are only allowed to provide abortions in extremely limited circumstances is unacceptable and puts the health and wellbeing of our service members and their families at risk.

The decision to get an abortion is deeply personal and should be made by a woman and her doctor, not by politicians.

Our service members expect that they will receive the best possible health care. But our military healthcare providers can’t even give them an abortion when their health is at risk.

And we know that “exceptions” to abortion bans don’t work. We see horrific stories on the news about women who were denied care that they were SUPPOSED TO receive under an exception, often ending with the mother nearly losing her life.

We have more than 100,000 active-duty service members stationed in Texas. We’ve heard stories of a young woman, who died after experiencing a tragic miscarriage at 17-weeks. After being faced with this devastating loss, her doctors delayed medically necessary and lifesaving care because of the state’s abortion ban. She died as a result of an infection she developed because that care was delayed, leaving behind a young daughter.

In Georgia, another young woman experienced a rare complication with medication abortion where her body did not expel all of the fetal tissue. When she sought out medical care, she waited 20 hours before doctors were able to operate because of the state’s abortion ban. While she waited, her infection spread and her organs began to fail. Amber’s care came too late and she died as a result of the infection leaving behind a six year old son.

We ask our servicewomen to put their lives on the line for this country. They shouldn’t have to risk their lives giving birth.

But the fact remains that a woman should never need a so-called exception to get an abortion and it shouldn’t need to be an emergency before she can get care. It should be available, a decision a woman gets to make over her own body and her own life.

My amendment would repeal the draconian ban on abortions within the military health system, allowing our servicewomen and military families to have the freedom of access and the freedom to choose.

Thank you and I yield back.”

This program is administered by Express Scripts — the second largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in the United States — covering 90-100 million Americans, including 9.5 million TRICARE beneficiaries.
This new law negatively impacts Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, a major PBM with 23 retail pharmacies throughout the state that CVS has now vowed to shutter.
Express Scripts — and thus military beneficiaries — appear to be casualties in a political battle in Arkansas that now appears to be spilling east over the Mississippi.
Arkansas’ Act 624, which will hamper TRICARE beneficiaries’ pharmacy access when it goes into effect in January, sets a dangerous precedent that will hurt military retirees and their families.","Like millions of others in the military community, I receive my prescription medications through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. This program is administered by Express Scripts — the second largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in the United States — covering 90-100 million Americans, including 9.5 million TRICARE beneficiaries.

Shortly after I retired from the Navy in 2009, like most Americans, I remember hearing that if I liked my doctor, I could keep my doctor. I assumed I could keep my pharmacy too. It turns out, however, that in Arkansas, in Tennessee where I retired, and possibly other states like Louisiana, that might not be the case.

Arkansas Act 624, which targets “pharmacy middlemen,” was signed into law by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in April 2025, prohibiting PBMs or their affiliates from owning or operating pharmacies there. This new law negatively impacts Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, a major PBM with 23 retail pharmacies throughout the state that CVS has now vowed to shutter.

In the lawsuit seeking to overturn the new law, Express Scripts argues that “millions of Americans nationwide and hundreds of thousands of Arkansans rely on PBM-affiliated pharmacies for their prescription medications.” It notes they “served for more than 20 years as the principal mail-order pharmacy provider for the U.S. Department of Defense’s TRICARE program, which provides healthcare services to military members, retirees, and families.”

Unfortunately, there’s now a move in Tennessee to follow the Arkansas bad example and significantly restrict PBMs. State Sen. Bobby Harshbarger, R-Kingsport, is introducing state legislation that would exert more government control to purportedly save costs.

While consumers naturally would like to see lower prescription drug prices, it’s dubious that their prices would actually decrease since PBMs argue they do that already by negotiating rebates and scoring discounts from drug manufacturers at scale.

Moreover, as Tennessee is arguably even more remote than Arkansas, particularly considering the Blue Ridge Mountains, restricting pharmacy by mail will have a terrible impact on military retirees who often live in less expensive, rural areas to survive on pensions.

Express Scripts — and thus military beneficiaries — appear to be casualties in a political battle in Arkansas that now appears to be spilling east over the Mississippi. In their own lawsuit, CVS Health claims, “Act 624 is designed to target CVS Health, not to protect patients. Arkansas lawmakers crafted the law to exclude CVS Health’s pharmacy operations while protecting in-state pharmacy businesses, which often charge higher prices.”

Apparently the original version of the Arkansas bill would have also hurt Bentonville-based Walmart, which was seen as “a dealbreaker” by many lawmakers. Thus they carved out an exemption for Walmart while a top competitor, CVS, ends up leaving the state. Genoa, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth, has said it too is likely to close its 11 pharmacies in Arkansas.

While that’s a great deal for Walmart, it’s not so good for everyone else.

Whether or not PBM reforms are necessary appears to be an exceedingly complex issue across the country that one hopes isn’t being made for the wrong reasons.

Curiously, California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently rejected PBM reforms, vetoing SB 966 over cost and disruption fears, showing even progressive states are hesitant to overhaul PBMs.

Beyond elected officials, critics of PBMs are fairly active on the podcast circuit and news broadcasts. They cite cherry-picked anecdotes of cost differences in some individual cases to rile up audiences about a little-understood topic that impacts basically everyone who needs prescription drugs. Yet these folks typically use half-a-story, and leave out the positive aspects of PBMs — like a robust pharmacy-by-mail service, and more choices on where and how to buy medicines.

Arkansas’ Act 624, which will hamper TRICARE beneficiaries’ pharmacy access when it goes into effect in January, sets a dangerous precedent that will hurt military retirees and their families.

Tennessee shouldn’t follow suit, nor should other states. After military retirees served for at least 20 years on active duty, plus with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and tens of thousands still suffering from wounds, the last thing we need is to have access to life-saving prescription drugs severely curtailed by state laws. We must do better.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/m5z3a0-170125dha-pharmacyphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/170125DHA-PHARMACYphoto01.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-07-16 16:56:36.310436

With more than 15 years of service at BJACH and nearly three decades in the nursing profession, Boone’s career has spanned nearly every corner of the hospital — from inpatient care and family medicine to forensic nursing and referral management.

Boone began her time at BJACH in the Progressive Care Unit, a high-acuity inpatient ward that managed telemetry patients and post-operative recoveries. She later supported the transition of the Family Medicine Clinic to a Patient-Centered Medical Home model, served as a virtual health care coordinator, and worked in the Soldier Centered Medical Home.

Today, she serves as a nurse consultant in managed care, helping patients navigate complex referrals, TRICARE authorizations and specialty care through the civilian network.

“You never know what burden someone is carrying when they call,” Boone said. “Sometimes it’s a medical issue, sometimes it’s something more personal. When they reach me, they can rest assured they’re talking to someone who will advocate for them.”

In addition to her primary duties, Boone is one of three certified Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners at BJACH. Over the past several years, she has devoted more than 1,600 hours of on-call time, providing professional, compassionate care to individuals impacted by sexual assault and mentoring new forensic nurses across the installation.

“It’s one of the most meaningful roles I’ve ever had,” she said. “From the moment they walk into the ER, we’re with them — making sure they’re supported, respected and never alone.”

Her commitment extends beyond any one department. Boone frequently steps in to assist during staff shortages across BJACH — in the emergency room, labor and delivery, family medicine and more.

“Cyndi goes above and beyond to ensure patient care remains a top priority,” said Sabrina Cobb, Boone’s supervisor. “She mentors others, supports mission readiness, and leads by example — all without ever asking for recognition.”

Boone said her approach to nursing has always been rooted in service.

“I’ve got a servant’s heart,” she said. “That’s just who I am. You treat people the way you’d want your family to be treated.”

Whether supporting a patient through a challenging diagnosis or helping a new nurse learn the ropes, Boone said she feels honored to serve the Fort Polk community.

“As long as I’m able, I’ll keep doing what I can to help,” she said. “I’m grateful to be here — and grateful to be part of a team that cares this deeply.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9182518/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-16 15:56:28.226508

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Jack Brown, 97th Healthcare Operations Squadron TRICARE operations and patient administration non-commissioned officer in charge, from Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, who rises to daily challenges while maintaining high standards below.

Can you share a recent experience where you were challenged to perform at your absolute best? What did you learn about yourself through that experience?

I don’t think there is just one experience I have had recently that I was challenged to perform to my absolute best, I try to approach every situation, big or small, with the same mindset and that’s to give whatever my 100% is that day, sometimes I only have 70% but you can count on it that I am going to give you 100% of that 70%.

The Air Force emphasizes both precision and lethality. How do you apply those concepts within your specific role to ensure mission success for Altus AFB?

As a 4A (Health Services Management), precision is the job. In our field, we might be managing patient records, ensuring readiness data is accurate, or even assisting with patient benefits; there is zero room for error, people’s health and mission readiness depend on it. With our team maintaining accurate documentation and streamlined processes, we can make sure that Airmen are medically ready to train and deploy at a moment’s notice. This readiness is where our lethality comes from, ensuring our force is fit, cleared, and capable of carrying out our mission to train exceptional mobility Airmen.

How have you seen the principle of meritocracy reflected in your work environment at Altus, and how does it motivate you to perform at your best?

I have seen the principle of meritocracy implemented throughout the Wing since I arrived four years ago. By this principle being highlighted, it allows Airmen to stand out based on their performance, and being a part of the medical group, that’s no problem!

What specific steps do you take in your role to ensure you and your team are always prepared to execute the mission, even on short notice?

I have recently stepped into a more visible leadership position and my Flight Commander, 2nd Lt. Darby, has an amazing saying, “If you stay ready, you never have to get ready."" I have really tried to embody this saying, and it has begun to allow our team to flourish and become proactive not reactive.

How does your work at Altus directly or indirectly contribute to maintaining the Air Force's lethality on the global stage?

Being in the Health Services Management career field, my work directly and indirectly supports the Air Force’s global lethality by making sure our Airmen are medically ready to deploy and execute at a moment’s notice. 4A’s manage medical records, medical registration, and even readiness data. By ensuring all this information is up to date and accurate, we are helping commanders make informed decisions about their force deployment capabilities. Altus AFB is a vital training hub for aircrew members on the KC-135, C-17, and KC-46. As a 4A, I help ensure the smooth operations of the 97th Medical Group, which in turn supports the health and availability of instructors, students, and support staff. Without reliable medical care, the flow of qualified aircrew into the operational Air Force would slow, reducing global mobility and refueling capabilities. My work might not involve pulling the trigger or flying on a mission, but it is foundational to ensuring that those who do are ready, healthy, and mission-capable, making a huge strategic impact on the Air Force’s ability to project power and defend national interests around the world.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/25/2003743408/2000/2000/0/250612-F-KP877-1016.JPG,N,1.0,2025-07-16 13:56:28.385401

Notably, our results showed that, in comparison to White beneficiaries, Black and Asian/Pacific Islander beneficiaries were less likely to receive mAbs.","BACKGROUND

Between 2020 and 2022, there were nearly 100,000,000 infections and approximately 1,000,000 deaths attributed to SARS-CoV-2 in the USA.1,2 The development of therapies to prevent severe illness from COVID-19 in high-risk populations became crucial during the early pandemic. Researchers quickly identified monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as agents that could potentially reduce severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.3 Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced antibodies that target a specific protein on a virus to prevent it from entering or duplicating in human cells.4 This mechanism mimics the immune response and assists the body in fighting infections. Therefore, mAbs can be effective in both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection.4

Between November 2020 and February 2021, three mAbs, bamlanivimab, REGEN-CoV (casirivimab-imdevimab), and bamlanivimab-etesevimab, were given emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate illness from COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients who were at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, hospitalization, or death.5 Despite efforts from the government and healthcare systems to promote equitable distribution of mAbs to disadvantaged populations, data indicates lower mAb uptake among these groups.6 Multiple reviews of healthcare system data within the USA found that White patients were more likely than Blacks and other racial minority groups to receive mAb treatment.6,7 Moreover, high-risk patients without health insurance and patients living in high social vulnerability zip codes were less likely to receive mAbs.6,8,9 Although males were more likely to be hospitalized and admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 infections, national studies found higher uptake of mAbs in females.7,10

Anzeige

To our knowledge, no study has investigated whether the disparities in mAb usage identified across the USA also extend to the Military Health System (MHS). The MHS delivers care to approximately 9.6 million beneficiaries, including both active and non-active-duty service members, dependents, and retirees.11 Unlike the civilian healthcare system, the MHS offers universal insurance coverage to all beneficiaries through TRICARE, typically at no cost to the patient.12 Given that universal insurance has often been linked to increased access to care and reduced health disparities, the MHS may be a valuable model for examining whether there was equitable distribution of mAbs during the COVID-19 pandemic.13 In this context, we examined whether there were disparities in mAb usage within the MHS population by race, sex, and socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that the uptake of mAbs across each demographic category would be similar due to the MHS’s provision of universal coverage to all beneficiaries.

METHODS

Study Design, Population, and Data Source

This retrospective study identified TRICARE Prime and Plus beneficiaries ages 12–64 from November 9, 2020, to January 24, 2022, using claims data from the Military Health System Data Repository (MDR). Beneficiaries were eligible if they received a COVID-19 diagnosis and were seen within outpatient care during the study period. We excluded beneficiaries ages 65 and older due to the loss in transparency of care when Medicare becomes the primary insurance payer. Additionally, due to intermittent access to the MHS, National Guard and Reserves, along with their dependents, were excluded.

Clinical data from the MDR along with International Classification of Disease, 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes were used to identify COVID-19 diagnoses. This study looked at three monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments: bamlanivimab, casirivimab-imdevimab (REGEN-COV), and bamlanivimab-etesevimab. Treatments were identified using Current Procedural Terminology/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (CPT/HCPCS) codes. Based on each mAb manufacturer’s guidelines, ICD-10 codes along with pharmaceutical data from the MDR were utilized to determine if beneficiaries were at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 and/or being hospitalized. All CPT/HCPCS and ICD-10 codes can be found in Table S1.14‐17 We employed the beneficiary’s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) record to obtain demographic information such as categorical age, biological sex, beneficiary status (active duty, dependent, and retiree), self-reported race (White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native), sponsor rank (junior enlisted, senior enlisted, junior officer, senior officer, warrant officer), associated branch of service (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps), and healthcare setting (direct care and private care) for analysis. Sponsor rank was determined to be a suitable proxy for socioeconomic status as shown in prior studies of TRICARE beneficiaries, with enlisted rank being a correlate of lower socioeconomic status.18,19 Ranks of dependents and retirees are based upon their sponsor’s rank and rank prior to retirement, respectively. Beneficiaries associated with the US Space Force were grouped with those in the US Air Force due to their small sample size. As a result of high rates of missing data, ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) was not retained for analysis.

Statistical Analysis

Analyses comprised descriptive statistics on patient demographics and frequency of COVID-19 mAb treatment for all eligible beneficiaries and by sex, race, sponsor rank, and risk status. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for patient likelihood of receiving mAb treatment were obtained using simple and multivariable logistic regression models for all beneficiaries as well as only those classified as “high risk.” Multivariable models included sex, race, sponsor rank, and risk status as independent predictors for receipt of mAb treatment with beneficiary status and categorical age as potential confounders. To address the high rates of missing race data, we applied the reweighted estimating equations (RWEE) imputation technique to the logistic regression models.20 Observed and weighted frequencies for race are provided in Table S2.

Anzeige

Statistical significance of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined, a priori, as exclusive of 1.00 and α = 0.05. This study was reviewed and found exempt by the Institutional Review Board at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). We adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

RESULTS

We identified 221,036 beneficiaries with a COVID-19 diagnosis receiving outpatient care during the study period, of which 9907 (4.5%) received mAb treatment (Fig. 1). Beneficiaries who received treatment were predominately female (57%), of White race (53%), ages 45–64 (64%), dependents (56%), in an enlisted rank (77%), and not at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (86%) (Table 1).

DISCUSSION

Through this investigation, we sought to assess whether disparities in usage of mAb treatment for COVID-19 existed within the Military Health System between the period of November 2020 and January 2022. After analyzing medical claims data for three prominent mAbs, it was found that 4.5% of TRICARE beneficiaries who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period received mAb treatment. Beneficiaries who were at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 were more likely to receive mAbs than those who were not at high risk. Despite universal healthcare coverage, disparities in the likelihood of receiving mAbs were observed by race, sex, and sponsor rank, as well as between private and direct care sectors of the MHS.

Notably, our results showed that, in comparison to White beneficiaries, Black and Asian/Pacific Islander beneficiaries were less likely to receive mAbs. This finding is consistent with research conducted within the civilian population that has shown lower uptake of mAbs among certain minority groups. For example, a review of data from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network reported that Black and Asian patients were significantly less likely to receive mAbs than White patients, with a 22% and 48% gap in usage, respectively.7 Additionally, a review of electronic health records from four health systems in the USA found that Black patients were less likely to be treated with mAbs than White patients.6

It has been proposed that a complex interplay of social, cultural, and clinical factors may be associated with rates of acceptance for mAbs among different racial/ethnic groups.21 For example, Bierle et al. found that Black and Asian patients, and those who identified as having a primary language that was not English, were more likely to refuse mAb therapy.21 Factors such as health system mistrust, medical misinformation, and differences in cultural beliefs surrounding medicine that have also been associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy may factor into decisions to accept mAb therapy.22

Despite adjustment for potential covariates, our study revealed that female beneficiaries had a higher likelihood of receiving mAbs in comparison to male beneficiaries. Although this finding aligns with existing studies based on national healthcare system data, which demonstrate slightly higher percentages of mAb uptake by female patients,7,8,10 we hypothesize that our finding is driven by the different arenas in which beneficiaries sought care. Current MHS guidelines prioritize direct care for active-duty service members23, which in 2021 were ~ 83% male.24 Additional factors which may drive this difference have been observed in the greater US population, and include the greater likelihood of females to seek medical attention than males.25,26 For example, a cross-sectional study of adults with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses in the USA found that females had higher odds of seeking treatment from their physician in comparison to males.27 Alternatively, there could have been implicit biases or systemic issues that led to differences in treatment allocation by sex.28 Nonetheless, our findings are concerning considering the evidence that males with COVID-19 are at higher risk for severe illness, hospitalization, and death, in comparison to females.27,29 These findings are also concerning from a military perspective, as the Armed Forces are majority male and must be fit for duty in order to carry out their mission. Further research is needed to determine the reasons influencing these decisions, particularly for active-duty service members.

Anzeige

One significant finding was the provision of mAbs to patients who were not at high risk from COVID-19 infection. In direct care, 755 of 1029 patients (73.4%) and in purchased care, 7,764 of 8878 patients (87.5%) who received mAbs did not meet the clinical criteria. There are several possible explanations. One is incomplete coding which fails to capture the full scope of patient risk factors; however, it seems unlikely that over 70% of patients in both care sectors were miscoded. A second is social determinants of health which are not normally recorded in a healthcare setting, such as the need to care for family members, or low food security which is independently correlated with COVID-19 infection.30 It is notable that military populations may also experience food insecurity, particularly in the enlisted ranks.31 In our study, enlisted personnel and their beneficiaries comprised approximately 71% of those diagnosed with COVID and 77% of those receiving mAbs, with a slightly higher percentage of those at high risk than not. However, social determinants could not be conclusively identified from our dataset. A third is older age, as those aged 55 + accounted for only 7.7% of those diagnosed with COVID, but 37.1% of those receiving mAbs. This is also the only group where the number of patients receiving mAbs were at high risk vs. not at high risk, and therefore mAb provision in this group may reflect an abundance of caution on the part of providers. Neither our dataset nor the existing literature provides a ready explanation for the use of mAbs outside of high-risk groups, and therefore more research is needed to answer this question.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. It constitutes a population-level examination of prescribing practices across over 200,000 patients from multiple socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. Because this population is nationally representative and predominantly working age, the study is not limited to those of lower income or advanced age, such as studies in the Medicaid and Medicare populations, respectively. As MHS beneficiaries have universal insurance and generally at least one fully employed family member, the results of this study can be used to assess the disparities which persist despite insurance and job status. This study also has several limitations. As a secondary data analysis, it is subject to potential error, including missing data or inaccurate coding, and does not capture clinical nuances that may appear in provider notes, including clinical findings and patient vital signs. Our analysis did not account for any changes in the eligibility criteria for high risk during the study period. This study also does not capture care provided outside the MHS. As race was imputed for non-active-duty beneficiaries, this study may not have captured a full picture of disparities. Finally, this study did not stratify by multiple factors, such as age with rank or gender with race, which limits the granularity of the findings. Further research is needed to answer this question.

CONCLUSION

Despite the provision of universal insurance to MHS beneficiaries, this study showed differences in mAb treatment by race, rank, sex, and care arena. Findings by race and sex are in line with studies in the greater US population, suggesting that factors beyond insurance are affecting the provision of mAbs. While those at high risk of severe COVID-19 and associated complications were more likely to receive mAbs, the greatest number of beneficiaries receiving mAbs were not at high risk. The reasons for this were not determinable from our dataset nor from existing literature, and therefore further research is needed to answer this question.

The agreement resolves allegations that Gilead engaged in an illegal kickback scheme to promote its HIV medications.

Gilead is accused of violating federal anti-kickback laws between January 2011 and November 2017 by providing gifts, travel, and other incentives to health care providers to encourage the prescription of its HIV drugs — including Stribild, Genvoya, Complera, Odefsey, Descovy, and Biktarvy. These actions led to the submission of millions of dollars in false claims to government health care programs.

Of Pennsylvania’s share, $642,189 will go directly to the state’s Medicaid program.

The settlement was coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Of the total amount, $49 million will support Medicaid programs nationwide, with the rest distributed to Medicare, Tricare, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP).

Gilead reportedly paid high-volume prescribers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to act as speakers at promotional events, often covering luxury travel and meals. Internal compliance systems at the company failed to stop the improper conduct.

Attorney General Sunday joined 48 other Attorneys General, along with representatives from the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in securing the settlement.

New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the settlement Tuesday, leading a coalition of 49 attorneys general that accused the pharmaceutical company of using gifts, luxury meals, and paid travel to influence health care providers from 2011 to 2017. New York will receive $6.6 million as part of the $202 million nationwide agreement.

“When pharmaceutical companies put profits before patients, New Yorkers suffer,” James said. “Gilead undermined our health care system with illegal kickback payments, and now they are being held accountable.”

According to the settlement, Gilead paid health care providers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to speak at promotional events for its HIV medications, including Stribild, Genvoya, Complera, Odefsey, Descovy, and Biktarvy. The company funded travel to popular destinations like Hawaii, Miami, and New Orleans, and hosted events at high-end restaurants. In New York, venues included Del Posto, Asiate, Palma, and the James Beard House, which hosted 157 of Gilead’s speaker programs.

Federal anti-kickback laws prohibit pharmaceutical companies from offering inducements to influence medical decisions. The investigation found Gilead failed to enforce internal safeguards meant to prevent its sales staff from offering such perks.

The violations included a New York City nurse practitioner who attended 75 dinner programs, including 40 on the same topic repeated multiple times within six months. That nurse often brought a sibling who was not a prescriber. In another case, a group of 10 Manhattan doctors attended or spoke at 384 dinner events—many of which were held within days of one another and often repeated the same content.

The $202 million settlement includes $49 million for state Medicaid programs and additional funds for Medicare, Tricare, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. The deal was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice.

Attorney General James credited the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for its support and thanked staff in her office’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their role in the investigation.

Tropical Storm Barry’s remnants triggered catastrophic flash flooding in Central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend, particularly in Kerr County.
A tropical storm is a type of tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
While not as intense as hurricanes, tropical storms can lead to widespread flooding, downed trees, infrastructure damage, and disruption of military operations, said Deussing.
Even dissipating tropical storms, like Tropical Storm Barry in early July 2025, brought flash floods and deadly river surges over 100 miles inland.","JULY 16, 2025 – Hurricane season is fast approaching, bringing potential threats to military families stationed in coastal regions, particularly along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, but it can also impact families further from the coast as well. When a hurricane or tropical storm is headed your way, preparation can mean the difference between safety and danger.

While hurricanes often receive the most attention, tropical storms, which have sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph, can also bring serious hazards such as heavy rainfall, inland flooding, and power outages. These storms are more frequent than hurricanes and can impact areas well inland, catching families off guard if they focus only on coastal hurricane warnings.

Tropical Storm Barry’s remnants triggered catastrophic flash flooding in Central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend, particularly in Kerr County. Torrential rains, up to 20 inches in some areas, sent the Guadalupe River surging as much as 29 feet in less than an hour, devastating summer camps like Camp Mystic and causing over 130 deaths and more than 100 people missing.

“This tragic event, far inland and unrelated to a hurricane, underscores how quickly remnants of tropical storms can become life-threatening,” said Dr. Eric Deussing, public health emergency officer for the Defense Health Agency. “Military families, especially those stationed inland, should stay alert for tropical systems even when a full hurricane isn’t forecasted.”

Military installations in the path of tropical storms and hurricanes are at risk to many of the same public health threats as our civilian neighbors, said Deussing.

“Clearly, natural disasters and their effects cross borders and federal fence-lines at will, he said. “These storms can also pose a wide range of public health threats that persist well beyond the initial impact.”

How these storms are classified

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines a hurricane (https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hurricane.html) as a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher. When a storm’s maximum sustained winds reach 74 mph, it is called a hurricane. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) is a 1 to 5 rating, or category, based on a hurricane’s maximum sustained winds. The higher the category, the greater the hurricane’s potential for property damage. For example, Hurricane Katrina (https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina), which hit Louisiana and Mississippi in 2005, was a Category 5 storm causing an estimated $108 billion in damage and 1,833 fatalities.

A tropical storm is a type of tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph. While not as intense as hurricanes, tropical storms can lead to widespread flooding, downed trees, infrastructure damage, and disruption of military operations, said Deussing. In fact, many tropical storms quickly intensify and become hurricanes with little notice, making early preparation essential.

According to Ready.gov (https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes), the regional hurricane threats fall into three geographic areas:

Atlantic Basin: This region includes the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of America. Hurricanes that form here primarily affect the coasts of the United States, including the Gulf Coast and East Coast, as well as territories such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

Eastern Pacific Basin: This area extends westward from Mexico and Central America to 140°W longitude. Hurricanes and tropical storms in this basin can affect Mexico and Central America, and occasionally the southwestern U.S. and Hawaii. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 to Nov. 30.

Central Pacific Basin: This region covers the Pacific Ocean westward from 140°W longitude up to the International Date Line. Tropical cyclones in this basin, which are called hurricanes like those in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, can affect Hawaii and other islands in the central Pacific. The Central Pacific hurricane season is June 1 to Nov. 30.

Understanding your risk

Don’t underestimate any storms just because they fall below hurricane strength, said Deussing. Tropical storms have caused billions of dollars in damage and dozens of fatalities. Their unpredictable paths and potential to strengthen rapidly make them a serious risk as well.

Staying informed is one of the best ways to both plan and prepare for these weather emergencies. There are a number of excellent information sources to help you prepare. Military OneSource (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/resources/millife-guides/home-disaster-planning/) notes hurricane news and information may be provided through the Emergency Alert System. This system, along with news and government agency social media sites, can provide information about what to do, where to go and how to contact local disaster relief services.

In addition, your installation may choose to activate an Emergency Family Assistance Center. An EFAC provides a central hub for the dissemination of accurate and timely information and also connects victims to support and resources. To learn more about EFAC, contact your Military and Family Support Center (https://installations.militaryonesource.mil/search?program-service=26/view-by=ALL).

Preparing before the storm

Proactive preparation is key to ensuring your family’s safety and minimizing potential damage. Defense.gov (https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Hurricane-Preparedness/) and weather.gov offer these top tips for hurricane and tropical storm preparedness:

Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem. Find out how rain, wind, and water could happen where you live so you can start preparing.

Treat tropical storms with the same urgency as hurricanes. High winds, flash flooding, and power outages can occur even in weaker storms. Don’t wait for a Category 1 or higher designation to take action. Even dissipating tropical storms, like Tropical Storm Barry in early July 2025, brought flash floods and deadly river surges over 100 miles inland. Don’t dismiss a “remnant system”—it can cause major flooding without hurricane-force winds.

Have enough supplies for your household, including medication, disinfectant supplies, cloth-face coverings and pet supplies in your go bag or car trunk.

If you or anyone in your household has a disability, identify whether you may need additional help during an emergency.

You may have to evacuate quickly due to a hurricane, so know your local evacuation zone.

Download the FEMA app (https://www.fema.gov/about/news-multimedia/mobile-products) and receive real-time alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations nationwide.

Review your insurance policies and make sure personal documents, like identification, are up to date.

Discuss your hurricane emergency plan with members of your household.

Prepare your business or workplace with a continuity plan to continue operating when disaster strikes.

“Before the storm, individuals can prepare for public health threats by stocking up on clean water (1 gallon/person/day for three–seven days), creating a health and hygiene kit (hand sanitizer, insect repellant, soap, bleach, gloves, masks, and toilet supplies), and getting vaccinated for potential exposures to tetanus, flu, or hepatitis A/B,” said Deussing.

Following a hurricane

Public health threats following a hurricane broadly include vector-borne diseases (https://ph.health.mil/topics/entomology/vbd/Pages/default.aspx), water-borne diseases (https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-water-data/waterborne-disease-in-us/index.html), and mold (https://ph.health.mil/topics/workplacehealth/ih/Pages/Indoor-Air-Quality-Mold.aspx) exposure, said Deussing. Additionally, there can be environmental and hazardous waste exposures which can result in further health risks.

Tropical storms, especially those that stall, also carry similar public health risks, said Deussing.

“The Central Texas floods following Tropical Storm Barry’s remnants illustrate a second wave of public health risks,” said Deussing. “Floodwaters can persist for days, raising contamination, waterborne disease risk, and prompting mold growth and vector breeding, and all without a Category 1 warning.”

Defense.gov offers this advice for the immediate aftermath of a hurricane:

If you evacuated, return home only when officials say it is safe.

Once home, drive only if necessary, and avoid flooded roads and washed-out bridges. If you must go out, watch for fallen objects in the road, downed electrical wires, and weakened walls, bridges, roads, and sidewalks that might collapse.

Walk carefully around the outside of your home to check for loose power lines, gas leaks, and structural damage. Stay out of any building if you smell gas, if floodwaters remain around the building, if the building or home was damaged by fire, or if the authorities have not declared it safe.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is one of the leading causes of death after storms in areas dealing with power outages. Never use a portable generator inside your home or garage.

Turn on your flashlight before entering a vacated building; the battery could produce a spark that could ignite leaking gas, if present.

Hurricane season can be a stressful time, but by taking the necessary precautions and preparing in advance, service members and their families can reduce their risk significantly and stay safe. Stay informed, stay prepared, and stay safe!

Rakesh Jha is a seasoned IT leader and enterprise architect, renowned for transforming complex insurance technology landscapes with innovation, precision, and deep domain expertise. Over a distinguished 21 year career, he has shaped the digital backbone of Fortune 500 insurers, architecting next generation solutions that automate compliance, streamline policy administration, and significantly reduce operational costs. As Manager of Application Delivery at DXC Technology, Jha leads strategic modernization programs and inspires global cross functional teams to reimagine the future of insurance systems.

Early Life and Academic Foundation

Rakesh’s journey into enterprise technology began with a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from the Malaviya National Institute of Technology MNIT Jaipur, one of India’s premier engineering institutions. Although rooted in mechanical disciplines, his academic training in problem solving, systems design, and quantitative reasoning provided a solid foundation for his transition into software engineering. It was here that Rakesh developed the structured thinking and technical rigor that would later become the bedrock of his architectural mastery.

Professional Journey

Rakesh launched his career in 2004 with Patni Computer Systems, supporting MetLife Insurance System. Early exposure to large scale, mission critical platforms gave him firsthand insight into the reliability and precision required in financial services infrastructure. By 2006, he had joined DXC Technology then CSC, where he began a decade of transformative work on legacy life insurance systems like Vantage One, wMA, and LifeComm impacting millions of policies.

His career continued to ascend at Genpact and Webilent Technology, where he drove enterprise automation and architectural modernization. Returning to DXC in 2020, he now leads cutting edge initiatives including the Ledger and Disbursement System LDS, a scalable platform projected to save $1.5 million annually while reducing manual workflows by 65 percent.

From automating IRS tax form generation to architecting cloud native reporting systems, Jha’s work pushes the envelope of what legacy modernization can achieve. His technical portfolio spans COBOL to microservices, and mainframe to cloud, always focused on aligning IT outcomes with business goals.

Leadership and Innovation

Jha’s leadership style blends strategic foresight with technical depth. He is a facilitator of Joint Application Design JAD sessions, a mentor across globally distributed teams, and a trusted advisor to client executives. Whether leading multimillion dollar migrations or guiding agile development teams, his approach is characterized by collaboration, accountability, and a deep understanding of both business and technology ecosystems.

His ability to manage ambiguity and deliver under pressure has made him a go to leader for modernization programs. For example, as solution architect for the Common Remitter Tool CRT, he designed a system to manage remittance files from over 60 financial institutions, improving data ingestion and operational agility.

Notable Achievements

Rakesh’s track record of innovation is marked by projects with measurable impact. He architected the Data Retention and Disposal DRD application for MetLife, unifying 26 legacy systems into a secure and compliant data framework. He also led the Date Management Automation Tool DMAT initiative, replacing a costly third party engine and saving $50,000 annually.

Among other standout projects are the Nonforfeiture Letter Compliance solution and the Pre Authorized Check Premium Payment System, both addressing regulatory compliance while improving customer experience. His efforts have not only earned DXC multiple client successes but also garnered him internal awards in 2022 and 2024.

Academic Contributions

While not formally involved in academic publishing, Rakesh bridges theory and application through continuous innovation. His use of emerging technologies such as Generative AI, Power BI, and RESTful APIs reflects a commitment to integrating academic advancements into real world solutions. He exemplifies the modern technologist one who learns continually, experiments boldly, and implements reliably.

Future Vision and Impact

Rakesh Jha currently leads cloud migrations, compliance automation, and digital transformation efforts that redefine insurance technology.

The request “constitutes yet another abusive maneuver” by Equatorial Guinea, France’s agent, Diégo Colas, told the court.
In 2020, the international court ruled that the building was a private residence, not a diplomatic outpost, rejecting a claim from Equatorial Guinea that the seizure violated international law.
Equatorial Guinea returned to The Hague in 2022, arguing the French government was obliged to return the assets based on a U.N. anti-corruption convention.
Despite its oil and gas riches, Equatorial Guinea has a dramatic gap between its privileged ruling class and much of the impoverished population.","THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Lawyers for Equatorial Guinea accused France of “neo-colonial” behavior on Tuesday, urging United Nations judges to block the sale of a mansion on one of Paris’ poshest avenues in the latest instalment in a long-running legal tug-of-war over the multimillion-dollar property.

The African country filed a case at the International Court of Justice in 2022, alleging France is violating international law by refusing to return assets seized during a corruption investigation into Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea’s long-serving president.

France’s approach “may be described as paternalistic and even neo-colonial. We cannot accept such disdain for our sovereignty from France,” Carmelo Nvono-Ncá, Equatorial Guinea’s agent, told The Hague-based court.

Equatorial Guinea has asked the court for a series of urgent orders, known as provisional measures, to return the swanky mansion on one of Paris’s most prestigious streets, Avenue Foch, and to prevent France from selling the building.

Lawyers for France strongly rejected the need for provisional measures, telling judges no sale was imminent and the dispute should be resolved via negotiation. The request “constitutes yet another abusive maneuver” by Equatorial Guinea, France’s agent, Diégo Colas, told the court.

In 2020, the international court ruled that the building was a private residence, not a diplomatic outpost, rejecting a claim from Equatorial Guinea that the seizure violated international law.

Obiang was convicted in 2017, and given a three-year suspended sentence for embezzling millions of dollars in public money. French authorities seized money, luxury vehicles and the building, which boasts a hammam, a cinema and a night club.

The 57-year-old has faced scrutiny for corruption in other countries as well. In 2021, he was sanctioned by the United Kingdom for misappropriating public funds, including spending $275,000 on the bejeweled glove that Michael Jackson wore on his “Bad” tour. Switzerland and Brazil have also opened investigations into his finances.

Equatorial Guinea returned to The Hague in 2022, arguing the French government was obliged to return the assets based on a U.N. anti-corruption convention.

Despite its oil and gas riches, Equatorial Guinea has a dramatic gap between its privileged ruling class and much of the impoverished population. The former Spanish colony is run by Africa’s longest-serving president, Obiang’s father Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.

Or, have you just married a uniformed service member? If you’re new to TRICARE, you may have some questions about how to enroll in a plan, get care, and learn more about your coverage. So, what exactly is TRICARE?

“TRICARE is the uniformed healthcare program for service members, retirees, their family members, and other eligible beneficiaries,” explained Malcolm Jones, a TRICARE subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency. “It brings together the resources of military hospitals and clinics with a network of civilian healthcare providers and pharmacies.”

TRICARE covers:

• Active duty service members and their family members

• National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

• Retirees and their family members

• Survivors

• Certain former spouses

• Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

• Dependent parents and parents-in-law (In some locations, they may be eligible for TRICARE Plus, a program offered at some military hospitals and clinics.)

• Foreign force members and their family members

Are you in one of these groups? Keep reading to learn more about the basics of using your TRICARE benefit.

Eligibility

Your uniformed service personnel office determines your TRICARE eligibility.

To check your eligibility, first make sure your information is fully updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Sponsors are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must register their eligible family members by going to a local ID card office. (Note: You should call first, or set up an appointment online, to check appointment availability.)

Then, log in to milConnect to check if you’re eligible for TRICARE. Once you’ve registered on the milConnect website, you can update your contact information in DEERS and view your TRICARE enrollment information.

Health plans

Choosing a plan

You have different TRICARE health plan options depending on your sponsor’s status, your relationship to your sponsor, your age, and where you live.

To see which plans you may be eligible for, check out the Plan Finder Tool and answer a few simple questions. Then, you can use the Compare Plans Tool to figure out which plan is right for you. (Note: Families can have split enrollment, meaning some family members can enroll in one plan, while others enroll in a different one.)

Enrolling in a plan

Once you know your plan, visit TRICARE Enrollment for steps on how to enroll or purchase a plan. These steps may differ depending on the plan you choose and where you live.

Are you a new active duty family member? Once you’re registered in DEERS, you'll be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan based on where you live and the plan selection of your other family members who aren’t active duty service members. You have 90 days from the automatic enrollment date to change to a different plan (TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime Remote, or the US Family Health Plan, if available).

Changing plans

Interested in switching your TRICARE plan? You may have the opportunity to do so during the annual TRICARE Open Season in the fall each year. Changes you make during open season will take effect Jan. 1 of the following year.

You may also be able to change your plan when you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. QLEs are certain life changes that open a 90-day window for you and your family members to make eligible enrollment changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.

Common QLEs include, but aren’t limited to:

• Marriage, divorce, or annulment

• Birth or adoption of a child (or placement of a child by a court in a member’s home)

• Moving

• Activation or deactivation

• Retirement or separation

• Losing or gaining other health insurance

If you experience a QLE, make sure to update DEERS right away.

Getting care

Regions

TRICARE is available worldwide, and your benefits are the same no matter where you live. But different regional contractors help deliver the benefit around the world. If you get civilian health care, this means you’ll reach out to different customer service contacts depending on where you live.

There are two TRICARE regions in the U.S.:

• East Region

• West Region

And there is one Overseas Region.

To learn which region you’re in, visit Regions.

Military hospitals and clinics

The DHA operates military hospitals and clinics. You may be able to seek care there, depending on where you are, what plan you have, and your beneficiary group.

Civilian network

You can also seek care from a civilian network of TRICARE-authorized providers. This network depends on your region.

To search for a network provider, use the Find a Doctor Tool to get you to the right provider directory.

Note: You may be able to see a non-network TRICARE-authorized provider, depending on your TRICARE plan. But you may have higher out-of-pocket costs, and you may have to file your own claims.

ID cards

For most beneficiaries, you’ll need to show your Uniformed Services ID card to your provider as proof of TRICARE coverage. If you’re an active duty service member, you’ll need to show your Common Access Card.

Coverage

TRICARE covers treatments, procedures, prescription drugs, or devices that are medically necessary and considered proven. Learn more about how a service becomes a TRICARE-covered benefit.

You can use the Covered Services Tool to see if a service is covered by TRICARE or not. You can search by keyword or browse common categories.

Pharmacy, dental, and vision coverage

TRICARE offers prescription drug coverage and several options for filling your prescriptions. You have the same prescription coverage with almost any TRICARE health plan. (Note: If you’re enrolled in USFHP, you have separate pharmacy coverage.)

To check if your prescription drugs are covered, use the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE’s medical coverage. Depending on your beneficiary group, you may get dental care through:

• Military dental clinics

• Active Duty Dental Program

• TRICARE Dental Program

• Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage, including eye exams, depends on:

• Who you are

• Your TRICARE plan

• Your age

Costs

Each TRICARE plan has different costs for care and coverage. See TRICARE Costs to view and compare costs for covered services, enrollment fees, and plan premiums.

Do you have more questions about plan options, enrollment, or getting care? Contact your regional contractor or visit www.tricare.mil for more information. Welcome to TRICARE!",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2402/8257668/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-16 11:57:22.335575

“After all the sacrifices they make for our nation each and every day, our military families should never have to face arbitrary, needless barriers to access prenatal care,” Duckworth said in the release.","Growing military families would have more avenues to receive essential prenatal care under reintroduced legislation that would make pregnancy a qualifying life event (QLE) under TRICARE.

Long waits, health care “deserts,” understaffed MTFs, and other concerns make the Improving Access to Prenatal Care for Military Families Act a needed change to support those who serve.

[TAKE ACTION: Help Military Families Secure Prenatal Care]

“Health care access is a key quality of life issue impacting military family readiness, particularly when expecting a baby,” MOAA President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian Kelly, USAF (Ret), said in a July 10 press release announcing the bill’s reintroduction. “With capacity constraints in both the military and civilian health systems, it is more important than ever to address barriers to accessing vital prenatal care essential to positive outcomes. The Improving Access to Prenatal Care for Military Families Act would provide the flexibility to switch TRICARE plans during pregnancy so beneficiaries can seek prenatal care that meets their needs.”

Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) introduced the bill (S. 2239) in the Senate; it had 12 cosponsors as of July 14. Rep. Teri Sewell (D-Ala.) introduced a House version (H.R. 4381), per the news release; she and Kim led House efforts on the bill in the 118th Congress.

The text of the legislation appears in the House version of the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), as it did in last year’s version. Text of the Senate version was not available as of July 14; the measure was not in the FY 2025 Senate NDAA draft and did not appear in the final bill.

Without this change in law, expectant military families would need to wait until the annual open season to change their TRICARE plan, even though families facing other life-changing events – including the adoption of a child – can switch plans outside that short window.

“After all the sacrifices they make for our nation each and every day, our military families should never have to face arbitrary, needless barriers to access prenatal care,” Duckworth said in the release. “Our commonsense legislation would help make it easier for our brave servicemembers and military spouses to access the high-quality care they need and deserve as they build their families.”",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/e5a7ad5e09fc42f399a45ba886e6040e/pregnancy-stock-h.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-16 07:56:57.646777

“We are the only health care system in America that goes to war. And so, our North Star always has to be that we are ready to provide first-class, world-class health care to our service members, to our warfighters, should we have to go into harm’s way,” Ferrara said on Federal Monthly Insights – Health IT.

The modern battlefield

The emphasis on readiness comes as military medical planners grapple with scenarios where air superiority, a key advantage during the War on Terror, may not exist. During conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, wounded service members were often evacuated to advanced medical facilities within the ‘golden hour,” contributing to the highest survivability rates in warfare history. But future conflicts may demand that field medics manage patients for extended periods without immediate evacuation options. That’s where technology becomes a force multiplier, according to Dr. Ferrara.

“How can we leverage artificial intelligence, other technological systems to be able to empower and use those as force multipliers for our field personnel?” Ferrara asked. “We can have specialists, whether they’re trauma specialists, intensivists, surgeons — you name it — be able to in real time, help guide people that are on the ground at the front line.”

Healthcare innovation at home and abroad

DHA is also rolling out advanced electronic health record systems designed specifically for deployed environments. The Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit — known as “BATDOK” — can track wounded service members from initial injury through their entire care from international warzone evacuation to facilities like Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

“It’s also synchronous, so a provider back here in the states can know exactly what’s going on with that patient in real time and give highly specialized, informed clinical decision support to a battlefield provider,” Ferrara said.

The technology is moving beyond battlefield applications. Military treatment facilities are implementing ambient listening technology that automatically transcribes clinical notes as providers speak — reducing administrative burden and allowing more time for direct patient care.

“The technology can listen, and you can speak to it, and it can just document instead of the old days where you had to write it and then type it out” Ferrara said. “That enables us to have our people who are our most valuable resource, spending their time doing direct patient care.”

The Military Health System is also leveraging generational advantages in technology adoption. Ferrara noted that medical personnel under 40 are ‘largely digital natives’ who have grown up with technology, making them more comfortable with new systems in their practice.

However, the increased reliance on technology raises questions about cybersecurity and communication reliability in contested environments. Military planners recognize that cyberspace is now part of the battlefield, creating both opportunities and vulnerabilities.

“We are always looking at how could we do these things asynchronously or offline.” Ferrar said. “That’s where things, especially like AI can come into play, where if a person on a battlefield can have a device and have tools that can help them,” Ferrara told The Federal Drive with Terry Gerton.

Technology deployment is part of a broader modernization effort that includes expanding partnerships with civilian healthcare systems and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Military Health system is implementing a common electronic health record, MHS Genesis, that will eventually provide seamless care transitions from military service to veteran status.

“Theater Genesis” represents the deployed version of this system, already operational on hospital ships and in European theaters. The goal is creating an integrated healthcare record that follows service members from stateside facilities through combat zones and back.

For Ferrara, who served 25 years as a Navy physician with four operational deployments, the technology investments represent a personal commitment to ensuring military medical readiness.

“The most important thing is that I can feel I take a very personal stake in knowing that our service members, when they go down range in harms way, are going to get the best care that they can possibly get. That’s honoring the pact that we make, not only with those service members, but with their parents,” Ferrara said.

“We go to war,” said Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, to a packed auditorium. Dr. Ferrara toured Naval Hospital Bremerton as part of his first official trip to the Pacific Northwest, July 14, 2025.

With 25 years of experience working with the Navy, Dr. Ferrara is no stranger to the challenges and opportunities that come with living and working at sea. “I’ve worn your uniform, sat in your seats, shared your mission, and understand how important it is to come out to talk with you,” he said.

As the direct advisor to the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, as well as the Secretary of Defense, for all things related to military medicine and healthcare, Dr. Ferrara emphasized that part of his role is to promote the work of hospitals across the country, including Bremerton, and to advocate on their behalf.

“The reason that’s important is that I’m your voice,” he said. “When I have to talk to the (Secretary of Defense), or folks at the White House or from across our government, I’m here to tell your story and explain what you do.”

Visiting hospitals and clinics is part of his “boots on the ground” approach to listen to local issues, concerns and successes, and understand how an installation works and succeeds.

""Here, in the third largest fleet concentration in the Navy, the geography is really unique. It’s really helpful to be able to come in and get that understanding. The most important thing is making sure those submarines, those ships, those air wings, are fully staffed,” he said.

He also noted that it is critical that those who need care are treated quickly so they can safely get back to work. “That’s our first mission,” he said.

Dr. Ferrara’s visit comes after Bremerton has faced about a decade of change. Staff shortages have pushed the hospital to do more with less. Despite the challenges, Dr. Ferrara spoke with conviction and optimism.

“One of the reasons why we’re such an amazing, strong military that represents our American values is that we make a compact with servicemembers, including yourselves, parents, loved ones, that when we send people into harm’s way, we’re going to provide them with world class military healthcare wherever they go. We have to be ready to do that,” he said.

He emphasized the need to work together to find durable solutions, increase the complexity of care, and maintain critical skills to solidify readiness.

Just as important is caring for the entire community. “Taking care of family members … is incredibly important. When our servicemembers have to go, they need to be laser-focused on their mission. Our servicemembers go to places we ask them to go where they may not have family or friends nearby. The Military Health System becomes a really important care provider and also a support network. That allows those warfighters to focus on their mission. That’s a really important thing we do.""

Reflecting his passion for meeting with hospital staff working on the ground, Dr. Ferrara met with Director and Navy Medicine Readiness Training Command Bremerton Commanding Officer Capt. Karla Lepore; Executive Officer Capt. Molly Jenkins; and Command Master Chief William Eickhoff. He also spoke with hospital staff and local Navy leadership.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9181273/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-15 16:56:19.693950

Or, have you just married a uniformed service member? If you’re new to TRICARE, you may have some questions about how to enroll in a plan, get care, and learn more about your coverage. So, what exactly is TRICARE?

“TRICARE is the uniformed health care program for service members, retirees, their family members, and other eligible beneficiaries,” explained Malcolm Jones, a TRICARE subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency. “It brings together the resources of military hospitals and clinics with a network of civilian health care providers and pharmacies.”

TRICARE covers:

Active duty service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

Survivors

Certain former spouses

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Dependent parents and parents-in-law (In some locations, they may be eligible for TRICARE Plus, a program offered at some military hospitals and clinics.)

Foreign force members and their family members

Are you in one of these groups? Keep reading to learn more about the basics of using your TRICARE benefit.

Eligibility

Your uniformed service personnel office determines your TRICARE eligibility.

To check your eligibility, first make sure your information is fully updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Sponsors are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must register their eligible family members by going to a local ID card office. (Note: You should call first, or set up an appointment online, to check appointment availability.)

Then, log in to milConnect to check if you’re eligible for TRICARE. Once you’ve registered on the milConnect website, you can update your contact information in DEERS and view your TRICARE enrollment information.

Health plans

Choosing a plan

You have different TRICARE health plan options depending on your sponsor’s status, your relationship to your sponsor, your age, and where you live.

To see which plans you may be eligible for, check out the Plan Finder Tool and answer a few simple questions. Then, you can use the Compare Plans Tool to figure out which plan is right for you. (Note: Families can have split enrollment, meaning some family members can enroll in one plan, while others enroll in a different one.)

Enrolling in a plan

Once you know your plan, visit TRICARE Enrollment for steps on how to enroll or purchase a plan. These steps may differ depending on the plan you choose and where you live.

Are you a new active duty family member? Once you’re registered in DEERS, you'll be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan based on where you live and the plan selection of your other family members who aren’t active duty service members.

Getting care

Regions

TRICARE is available worldwide, and your benefits are the same no matter where you live. But different regional contractors help deliver the benefit around the world. If you get civilian health care, this means you’ll reach out to different customer service contacts depending on where you live.

There are two TRICARE regions in the U.S.:

East Region

West Region

And there is one Overseas Region.

To learn which region you’re in, visit Regions.

Military hospitals and clinics

The DHA operates military hospitals and clinics. You may be able to seek care there, depending on where you are, what plan you have, and your beneficiary group.

Civilian network

You can also seek care from a civilian network of TRICARE-authorized providers. This network depends on your region.

To search for a network provider, use the Find a Doctor Tool to get you to the right provider directory.

Note: You may be able to see a non-network TRICARE-authorized provider, depending on your TRICARE plan. But you may have higher out-of-pocket costs, and you may have to file your own claims.

ID cards

For most beneficiaries, you’ll need to show your Uniformed Services ID card to your provider as proof of TRICARE coverage. If you’re an active duty service member, you’ll need to show your Common Access Card.

Coverage

TRICARE covers treatments, procedures, prescription drugs, or devices that are medically necessary and considered proven. Learn more about how a service becomes a TRICARE-covered benefit.

You can use the Covered Services Tool to see if a service is covered by TRICARE or not. You can search by keyword or browse common categories.

Pharmacy, dental, and vision coverage

TRICARE offers prescription drug coverage and several options for filling your prescriptions. You have the same prescription coverage with almost any TRICARE health plan. (Note: If you’re enrolled in USFHP, you have separate pharmacy coverage.)

To check if your prescription drugs are covered, use the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE’s medical coverage. Depending on your beneficiary group, you may get dental care through:

Military dental clinics

Active Duty Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program

Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage, including eye exams, depends on:

Who you are

Your TRICARE plan

Your age

Costs

HARRISBURG – Attorney General Dave Sunday joined a coalition of 48 other Attorneys General in securing a combined $202 million settlement from Gilead Sciences, Inc. for running an illegal kickback scheme to promote its HIV medications.

Gilead violated federal law by illegally providing incentives – including awards, meals, and travel expenses – to health care providers to prescribe Gilead’s medications, resulting in millions of dollars of false claims submitted to government health care programs.

Pennsylvania is expected to receive $1.28 million and $642,189 will go directly to its Medicaid program.

The settlement, reached in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, provides $49 million for Medicaid programs nationwide — with the remainder going to Medicare, Tricare, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP).

“Gilead used illegal kickbacks to corner the market on these life-saving drugs needed by one million Americans living with HIV,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday said. “We saw similar kickback schemes from drug manufacturers during the eruption of the opioid crisis. The money from this settlement will support people living with HIV and bolster prevention programs.”

From January 2011 to November 2017, Gilead violated federal anti-kickback laws by providing gifts to health care providers who attended and spoke at promotional speaker programs for Gilead’s HIV drugs: Stribild, Genvoya, Complera, Odefsey, Descovy, and Biktarvy. Gilead paid high-volume prescribers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to present as “HIV Speakers.” The company also covered travel expenses for speakers, including those traveling long distances and to attractive destinations, and hosted dinners at high-end restaurants.

Gilead’s internal compliance mechanisms failed to halt these violations. The company maintained policies and procedures that failed to prevent its sales representatives from improperly offering incentives to induce prescriptions.

Joining Attorney General Sunday in securing settlements with Gilead are the Attorneys General of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The Pennsylvania Medicaid Fraud Control Unit receives 75 percent of its funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under a grant award totaling $12,839,940 for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2025. The remaining 25 percent, totaling $4,279,979 for FY 2025, is funded by Pennsylvania.

Gilead paid high-volume prescribers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to present as “HIV Speakers.” The company also covered travel expenses for speakers, including those traveling long distances and to attractive destinations, such as Hawaii, Miami, and New Orleans, and hosted dinners at high-end restaurants. In New York, Gilead held dinners at several upscale restaurants including Del Posto, Asiate, and Palma. Gilead also held 157 HIV Speaker Programs at the James Beard House, making it one of Gilead’s most used venues for HIV Speaker Programs.

Gilead’s internal compliance mechanisms failed to halt these violations. The company maintained policies and procedures that failed to prevent its sales representatives from improperly offering incentives to induce prescriptions. Examples of this conduct include:

A nurse practitioner in New York City who attended 75 HIV Dinner Programs. This nurse practitioner attended 40 HIV Dinner Programs on the same topic three times or more within a six-month period. This nurse practitioner often brought their sibling—a pediatric nurse practitioner and non-prescriber of Gilead HIV drugs—to the programs.

In certain instances, the same group of doctors repeatedly attended the same HIV Speaker Programs together at various restaurants. For example, a group of ten doctors in Manhattan spoke at or attended approximately 384 HIV Dinner Programs at which the others were in attendance. Over 300 of these 384 HIV Dinner Programs were led by one of these 10 doctors. Each of the doctors repeatedly attended HIV Speaker Programs within 90 days of speaking on the same topic. In many instances, they attended a Dinner Program less than two weeks after speaking on the same topic.

Attorney General James thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for its partnership and assistance.

Joining Attorney General James in securing settlements with Gilead are the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

A National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units (NAMFCU) team participated in the investigation and conducted the settlement negotiations with Gilead on behalf of the states. In addition to New York, the team included representatives from the offices of the attorneys general of California, Indiana, North Carolina, and Virginia.

This matter was handled for New York by Assistant Attorneys General Jill D. Brenner and Nathan Shi, as well as Senior Auditor Investigator Tatum Serfilippi under the supervision of Medicaid Fraud Control Unit Director Amy Held and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Paul J. Mahoney. The Division of Criminal Justice is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General José Maldonado under the oversight of First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.

The counties affected are Delta, Mesa, and Montrose.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy).

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices Page for updates (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather).

(NASDAQ: ) to $3.00 from $4.00 while maintaining a Sector Perform rating on the medical technology company’s stock. The stock, currently trading at $2.19, has fallen nearly 78% over the past year, with InvestingPro data showing it’s trading well below its 52-week high of $10.62.

The price target reduction follows Zynex’s first-quarter revenue miss and the company’s decision not to issue guidance for 2025, creating uncertainty about its financial outlook.

RBC Capital noted that Zynex is experiencing payment volatility from former Tricare payers and, more significantly, a complete suspension of payments from Tricare itself, which represents 20-25% of the company’s sales exposure.

The payment issues with Tricare, Zynex’s largest payer, remain unresolved, with the company recently announcing that Tricare is extending its payment pause while it reviews prior claims.

In response to these challenges, Zynex has implemented two rounds of workforce reductions in 2025, announcing a 14% staff cut on June 24 following an earlier 15% reduction in the first quarter.

In other recent news, Zynex, Inc. announced that Tricare, its largest insurance customer, will continue its temporary payment suspension as it conducts further review. This development creates uncertainty for Zynex’s revenue stream, as Tricare represents a significant portion of the company’s customer base. The company has not provided a timeline for when a final decision on the suspension might be reached. Additionally, Zynex has appointed Steven Dyson as the new CEO, effective August 18, 2025. Dyson, who has over 25 years of experience in the medical technology sector, is expected to refocus Zynex’s business strategy towards a more optimized payer mix.

In another development, Zynex has secured a UK patent for a multiparameter, noninvasive sepsis monitoring device. This technology aims to provide early alerts about a patient’s sepsis status, potentially contributing to earlier detection and reduced mortality rates. Furthermore, H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Buy rating on Zynex stock, maintaining a price target of $8.00. The firm believes Dyson’s leadership will help Zynex return to a strong growth trajectory.

Hauschild, MPH, Defense Health Agency-Public Health

Most of us have had that “uh-oh” feeling usually accompanied by the desperate urge to find the “head” or “latrine” ASAP. This thought might be followed by, “Did I get some kind of stomach bug?”

Acute gastroenteritis illness, or AGI, commonly referred to as a “stomach bug,” can spread quickly through communities. It typically causes symptoms such as diarrhea, stomach pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting and sometimes fever and fatigue. Dehydration is a serious concern, especially in young children and older adults. Symptoms may last a day to over a week depending on the type of infection.

An AGI is often caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasite that has been unknowingly ingested, usually from a contaminated food or water source. These infections can lead to intense symptoms, including both vomiting and diarrhea, commonly described as “coming out both ends.”

Though AGIs occur year-round, they are often associated with food- and water-borne germs during the summer months, according to Defense Health Agency–Public Health experts.

“The cause may be traced to one’s own backyard, a local food source, or recreational activity,” said Dr. Charles McCannon, a medical doctor working for the preventive medicine division of the DHA-PH at Aberdeen, Maryland. “While the specific type of bug or germ responsible for the illness may not be identified, both the symptoms and the way to minimize the risk of getting sick are often the same.”

AGIs Are No Joke

“Most of the time, AGIs get better without treatment, but in certain people with weakened immune systems, the illness can become severe enough to require hospitalization or even cause death,” said McCannon.

Even in healthy adults, an AGI can impair a person’s ability to work and perform physical tasks, said McCannon. It can take days before symptoms improve, and a patient often needs time to rest for full recovery. Additionally, the dehydration and diarrhea associated with AGIs can also increase the risk of heat illness in hot environments.

The Military Is Not Immune

AGIs have long been a significant cause of illness among U.S. service members, said McCannon.

“In fact, U.S. service members have been found to be less likely to seek medical treatment than civilians,” he said. “By choosing to ‘tough it out’ while sick, service members are likely not going to be operating at their best and may increase the spread of germs to others in their units.”

AGI outbreaks in the military have resulted in temporary suspension of training, quarantining to barracks, efforts to disinfect barracks floors, and increased inspections of military eating establishments, said McCannon.

To identify possible outbreaks before they can affect military readiness, DHA-PH experts routinely monitor medical visits for several common AGI diseases. The diseases, categorized as reportable medical events, or RMEs, are required to be documented by military hospitals and clinics across all services in what’s called the DHA Disease Reporting System internet or DRSi (https://drsi.health.mil/DRSi).

To know the actual disease name, a patient must seek medical evaluation that includes laboratory testing to identify the specific type of virus, bacteria, or parasite. The diseases identified are reported in the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report, known as the MSMR (https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/AFHSD/Reports-and-Publications/Medical-Surveillance-Monthly-Report). However, since many cases of AGI are not diagnosed with the specific diseases, the number of reported cases is much lower than the number of service members infected.

“Most of the AGIs have similar symptoms and most people ‘self-treat,’ meaning service members don’t seek medical treatment,” said McCannon. “So, we know the reported medical data are just the tip of the iceberg. The actual impact to military readiness is even larger than what is suggested by the numbers of cases.”

Understanding Food- and Water-Borne Diseases of Military Concern

The most frequently diagnosed food- and water-borne AGI disease is Norovirus, also referred to as the Norwalk virus (https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html). In 2024, the next five most common AGI diseases in the military included campylobacteriosis (https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html), salmonellosis (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html), giardiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/giardia/about/index.html), E.coli (https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/about/index.html) infection, cryptosporidiosis (https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html), and shigellosis (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/index.html). Each year, thousands of service members seek medical treatment and are diagnosed with these diseases.

Most food- and water-borne diseases of military concern have similar symptoms and types of sources, said McCannon. In general, the germs that cause these diseases may last hours to days on surfaces and may live weeks, months or even years in some environments. Variations include time of symptom onset and duration of symptoms (https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/what-you-need-know-about-foodborne-illnesses). Most patients are treated for the symptoms, though antibiotics may also be prescribed for some.

McCannon explains that these common diseases occur everywhere and are consistent with occurrences in the civilian population. Service members can be at higher risk of exposure when performing duties in field, operational, or other austere conditions. Less common diseases, like amebiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/amebiasis/about/index.html) and hepatitis A (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-a/about/index.html) or, more rarely, botulism (https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/about/index.html), cholera (https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/about/index.html), Listeriosis (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/index.html), and typhoid fever (https://www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/about/index.html), are often associated with exposures overseas.

“It might sound gross, but most of the viruses and bacteria transmitted in food and water sources initially come from fecal matter of an infected animal or human,” said McCannon. “Until a body’s immune system can fight them off, the germs often live and multiply in the gut. Then the infectious germs are excreted, especially in diarrhea and vomit.”

McCannon said diseases are spread when the microscopic infectious germs get into drinking water, meat or seafood products, onto fruits or vegetables, or on surfaces that have been contaminated by infectious food products. A patient may ingest the germs directly from a food or water source. Sometimes they are infected by touching their mouth after contact with a contaminated object.

While AGIs are not spread through the air, they can be passed from a sick person to other people by activity such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom, or by touching doorknobs, phones, or utensils. This is why these diseases are considered infectious or communicable.

“As an example, Norwalk virus is considered a very contagious disease because the virus can easily be spread from a sick person to other people when they get virus particles on their hands from surfaces or items,” said McCannon. “The virus can survive 12 hours on hard surfaces. People who contact the contaminated surfaces of items and then touch their mouths can become sick.”

How Service Members Can Reduce Spread and Lower Risk

While there are no vaccines to prevent these specific diseases, they’re largely preventable by practicing good hygiene, cooking food thoroughly, consuming food and water from approved sources, and avoiding contact with contaminated sources, said McCannon.

He offered the following tips:

• Keep your hands clean—always!

o Wash hands with soap and water (https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html) for at least 20 seconds often, especially:

• After contacting food, animals, other people who may be sick (or their clothing or linens they use)

• Before and after handling or touching food or utensils/surfaces.

o Use gloves to avoid contacting potential germs.

• Clean and disinfect:

o Areas where a person or pet recently had diarrhea or vomited

o Potentially contaminated food utensils or surfaces (such as those in contact with raw meat or unwashed produce)

• Cook meats and shellfish thoroughly. In general, processed meet like hamburgers should be well-done, with no pink showing. But since meat can brown before it's completely cooked–especially in outdoor grilling–it’s best to use a meat thermometer to ensure the meat is heated to at least 160 F (71 C) at its thickest point.

• Drink pasteurized milk, juice, and cider.

• Wash fruits and vegetables.

• Wash laundry in hot water.

• Avoid swallowing water while swimming.

• Boil or filter (https://www.cdc.gov/drinking-water/prevention/water-treatment-hiking-camping-traveling.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/index.html) water from lakes, springs or rivers before drinking or preparing food with it.

Help Limit the Spread

Once sick, the most important thing a service member can do is help limit the spread, said McCannon. Avoiding contact with a sick person or their belongings is important, but that isn’t always practical.

“In certain military settings, close contact and shared quarters are a recognized concern,” he said.

McCannon recommended staying at home or isolating from casual contact with others as much as possible, ideally, for two days after symptoms stop. For more intimate contact, it’s best to wait much longer, like several weeks after you or your partner has been sick with an AGI.

While sick, don’t eat or drink anything that makes diarrhea worse, like dairy products, caffeine, or alcohol, said McCannon. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. For most AGIs, treatment includes rest and fluids to help prevent dehydration and fatigue. But consider seeking medical evaluation for a specific diagnosis of diarrheal illness.

Knowing the name of the germ causing your stomach bug may not change the treatment, but knowing the diagnosis can help our military’s public health experts identify trends and address outbreaks to keep our forces strong.

The company successfully dosed the first patient in its Phase 2b trial for BX004, a treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. This milestone has rekindled investor interest in BiomX's novel approach to treating antibiotic-resistant infections, which has been underperforming in recent years.

The Phase 2b trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving approximately 60 cystic fibrosis patients. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of BX004, with topline results expected in the first quarter of 2026. The therapy has already received both Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA, potentially accelerating its development timeline.

BiomX's pipeline extends beyond its cystic fibrosis program. The company recently reported positive Phase 2 results for BX211, its phage therapy for diabetic foot osteomyelitis, showing statistically significant improvements in ulcer healing compared to placebo. This program has attracted $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency, highlighting its strategic importance in addressing battlefield wound infections as well as civilian medical needs.

Investors are particularly encouraged by the regulatory pathway for BX004. The company anticipates feedback from the FDA in the second half of 2025 regarding plans to use real-world evidence linking bacterial reduction to clinical outcomes, which could further streamline the approval process. Despite the recent drop in stock price, the company's innovative approach to phage therapy and its potential to address significant unmet medical needs continue to attract investor attention.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-07-15 07:56:16.786869

[WASHINGTON, D.C.] — Combat Veteran and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)—who served in the Reserve Forces for 23 years and had both of her daughters through in vitro fertilization (IVF)—successfully secured a provision in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approved last week which would require TRICARE coverage of fertility services, including IVF for servicemembers who rely on it to build their families.

The SASC-passed bill will soon be considered by the full Senate.

“Even before I was wounded, I had made the difficult decision to delay building a family because I knew getting pregnant would impact my ability to be an Army aviator and to advance in the career I loved. Because of the miracle of IVF—and my access to reproductive healthcare through the VA—I’m now a mom to two beautiful girls. The reality is that members of the uniformed services face unique challenges when trying to start or build a family, and studies show that servicemembers and Veterans have higher rates of infertility compared to the general population. Given how much we ask of our heroes, we should do what we can to support them in building their families.

“After successfully securing this provision in last year’s bill that passed through committee, I’m so proud my colleagues helped me build on this progress to include it in this year’s bill as well. It’s past time our nation provides uniformed servicemembers with the same access to IVF that all Members of Congress already have and ensure our heroes can access the fertility treatment they need to start the families they’ve dreamed of.”

Patient Testimonials

“I suffered for years with foot and ankle pain. I tried orthotics, PRP, and multiple rounds of physical therapy on base, but nothing helped. I was told surgery might be the only fix because of a tendon tear. Then I found Dr. Repko. Two months later, I’m pain-free—no surgery, no downtime. I’m still amazed.”

,,2025-07-14 18:45:06+00:00,DefenseScoop,Pentagon reviewing payment applications from Havana Syndrome victims - DefenseScoop,Jon Harper,,,,,https://defensescoop.com/2025/07/14/havana-syndrome-dod-military-payment-applications/,"The Defense Department has started reviewing applications from personnel seeking financial compensation for brain health issues associated with the phenomenon known as Havana Syndrome, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson.
“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention.
“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.
The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.
“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil).","The Defense Department has started reviewing applications from personnel seeking financial compensation for brain health issues associated with the phenomenon known as Havana Syndrome, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson.

The term Havana Syndrome was coined after people working at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba’s capital city in 2016 reported a sudden onset of symptoms that had no obvious cause, including vertigo, imbalance, blurry vision, tinnitus, headache, hearing loss, nausea and cognitive dysfunction.

“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention. Such events have affected U.S. government employees, military servicemembers, and their families in countries around the world, and are now referred to as anomalous health incidents (AHI) by the U.S. government,” the Government Accountability Office explained in a July 2024 report, which also highlighted challenges that sufferers faced in accessing the Military Health System.

Congress several years ago passed legislation that authorized federal agencies to compensate affected employees, former employees and dependents for qualifying brain injuries.

“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.

“Under the HAVANA Act, DoD employees and their covered dependents who suffered qualifying brain injuries on or after January 1, 2016, in connection with certain Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI), are eligible for a one-time payment. The Department is committed to helping DoD personnel affected by AHIs,” he added.

A House Intelligence subcommittee report issued last December noted that Havana Syndrome incidents have also been reported in Austria, China, Colombia, Georgia, Germany, India, Poland, Russia and Vietnam, as well as the United States.

Estimates vary as to the number of individuals affected by the problem, GAO noted in last year’s report. As of January 2024, 334 people had qualified for care in the Military Health System, according to the government watchdog.

Some observers believe that incidents of Havana Syndrome may have been intentionally caused by adversaries using pulsed radio-frequency energy or focused ultrasound devices, but others are skeptical.

“Various government agencies and medical researchers have conducted studies on aspects of AHIs, but none have isolated a cause,” the GAO report stated.

A study by a panel of U.S. intelligence community experts — whose findings were declassified in 2022 — found that “known medical and environmental conditions, including psychosocial factors, could not explain some AHI cases with abrupt-onset, location dependent, audio-vestibular phenomena. It concluded that various forms of pulsed radiofrequency energy, as well as focused ultrasound in close access scenarios, were plausible explanations for these cases, though information gaps existed,” according to the GAO report, which noted that the experts “did not address the question of attribution to an actor, including the question of whether a foreign actor may be involved.”

Another IC assessment, released in March 2023, concluded it was “very unlikely” that a foreign adversary was responsible for the reported incidents, and that deliberate causal mechanisms were “very unlikely” to have produced the sensory phenomena and symptoms associated with them — although confidence levels in those conclusions varied among the IC agencies, per the GAO report.

Leadership of a GOP-led House Intelligence subcommittee criticized the 2023 IC assessment, saying it “lacked analytic integrity.”

“It appears increasingly likely and the Chairman is convinced that a foreign adversary is behind some AHIs,” officials wrote in a subcommittee report released in December 2024.

A former U.S. Army officer who led an official investigation told journalists from the show 60 Minutes that he believed Russia was behind attacks that caused Havana Syndrome symptoms, according to CBS News.

The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.

“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil). Individuals applying on behalf of a covered employee or covered dependent must provide documentation demonstrating the individual is authorized to act on behalf of the applicant,” Jules Hurst III, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, wrote in a June 20 memo, which provides details about the adjudication, payment and appeals processes.

“DCPAS may consult with offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to determine whether the incident causing the injury was in connection with war, insurgency, hostile act, or terrorist activity. For applications involving incidents that have been designated by DoD as ‘other incidents’ … DCPAS will request that the applicant or Director, Defense Health Agency, provide a designation letter … to validate that an incident at a particular location has been reported and the covered employee or covered dependent is authorized to receive medical care from DoD in relation to the incident,” Hurst wrote in the memo.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/6192861.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-14 15:56:25.587524

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The TRICARE referral and authorization waiver for the West Region expired on June 30. Providers must now follow standard TRICARE requirements for all new outpatient services.

The U.S. Defense Health Agency has confirmed that the temporary waiver of referral and authorization requirements for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region ended on June 30, 2025. As of July 1, 2025, all outpatient services for TRICARE Prime patients once again require appropriate referrals and authorizations in accordance with standard TRICARE guidelines.

The waiver was initially enacted to ease administrative burdens during the transition of managed care responsibilities to TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest), which assumed management of TRICARE West Region services on January 1, 2025. Under the waiver, providers did not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions.

Referrals for care that extend beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after June 30, 2025, will be subject to normal TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Providers are strongly encouraged to review the TriWest TRICARE Provider Handbook and referral protocols to avoid disruptions in care or reimbursement issues effective July 1.

The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).
(link is external) ### The Problem Solvers Caucus is a group of Members of Congress — split between Republicans and Democrats — committed to advancing common-sense solutions to key issues facing our nation.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of the TRICARE OB-GYN Treatment and Access without Lags in Care (TOTAL Care) Act, bipartisan legislation to make it easier for women enrolled in TRICARE Prime to access OB-GYN services.

Under current TRICARE Prime rules, beneficiaries must obtain a referral before visiting an OB-GYN, even for routine care like annual exams or prenatal appointments. This requirement often leads to delays and unnecessary administrative burdens for military families who already frequently face gaps in healthcare access due to relocations and deployments.

The TOTAL Care Act would remove outdated referral requirements for OB-GYN care under TRICARE Prime to ensure timely access to essential reproductive and maternal health services. Specifically, the bill would:

Allow TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to access OB-GYN care without a referral

Permit patients to designate an OB-GYN as a primary care provider

Allow OB-GYNs to directly order related services without extra approvals

The bipartisan legislation was introduced by Representatives Steven Horsford (NV-04), Maria Salazar (FL-27), and Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) and has 12 additional cosponsors, four of whom are Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus. The bill was brought forward for Caucus endorsement by Representatives Horsford and Salazar.

“Ensuring military personnel and their loved ones have the best care available isn’t partisan politics – it’s common sense,” said Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04). “I’m proud to partner with Rep. Salazar on the TOTAL Care Act, and I’m grateful for the Problem Solvers Caucus’ endorsement. Our legislation cuts through red tape to ensure servicemembers have access to the same, high-quality care that every other American has.”

""Our women in uniform risk their lives to defend this country, yet they’re forced to navigate unnecessary bureaucracy just to see an OB-GYN. That’s unacceptable,"" said Congresswoman María Salazar (FL-27). ""The TOTAL Care Act fixes that. I’m proud to help lead this effort, and I thank the Problem Solvers Caucus for endorsing this bipartisan solution. This is not a partisan issue, it’s about basic dignity, respect, and doing right by the servicewomen who fight for us. Together, we’re cutting the red tape and delivering the care they’ve earned.""

""OB-GYN care is primary care,” said Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06). “As a veteran, I am proud to stand with my colleagues to introduce this long overdue legislation to ensure our servicemembers and their families receive care in line with their civilian counterparts and without additional referrals or barriers. Servicemembers and their families should not be unfairly burdened simply because they raised their right hands in service. This bipartisan effort eliminates redundancy and delays and ensures access to critical women's healthcare.""

“Cutting down red tape to allow service members and their families easier access to critical care is a common sense fix. The Affordable Care Act got rid of the need for referrals for this kind of coverage years ago — leaving out members of our military is legislative oversight. The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

“The TOTAL Care Act is a smart, bipartisan fix that removes an outdated barrier to care and restores direct OB-GYN access for military families under TRICARE. It reflects exactly the kind of commonsense, patient-first reform I’ve long championed—cutting bureaucracy, improving care delivery, and ensuring our servicemembers and their families get the support they’ve earned,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “The Problem Solvers are proud to support this effort—and we’ll continue championing bipartisan solutions that ensure our military families receive the care, respect, and commitment their service has earned.”

Find a doctor in the West region

Find a doctor in the East region

You don't need a referral from a military doc, just find an in-network urologist in your region, call and make an appointment. Your health insurance card is your CAC and/or your SSN.

That said, you really need to go to the doctor more, at least to get an annual physical done. You might feel healthy now but you never know what a physical might catch, a lot of medical issues show no symptoms until they're severe, but easily treated if caught early. The copays are absurdly cheap and in my experience most clinics accept TRS.

You haven't been to the doctor and gotten an annual physical / check up? Or even gone to urgent care? If nothing else, I would highly recommend finding a primary family care doctor. Please get in the habit of preventative care.

Practically - you can go to your Tricare provider's website (mine is Triwest) and look up in network doctors. Or. start with the Tricare website and go from there. From there you can work out which hospitals / clinics / specialties are covered. I don't know if you need a referral for a urologist, but once you find out if they are in network you can call their office and find out.

Charles Rhyee has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Talkspace’s promising growth trajectory. The company is expected to achieve significant payor revenue growth, particularly with a 35% year-over-year increase, as it expands its Medicare and TRICARE contributions through 2025. Management has indicated that TRICARE is performing better than anticipated, benefiting from efficient marketing strategies and lower competition, which supports a positive outlook.

Furthermore, Talkspace’s strategic focus on enhancing utilization in the Payor segment is anticipated to yield returns on marketing investments in the latter half of 2025. The company has reaffirmed its revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, with expectations of a stronger performance in the fourth quarter. This strategic positioning, along with the potential for revenue reacceleration, underpins Rhyee’s confidence in Talkspace’s future prospects, justifying the Buy rating.
