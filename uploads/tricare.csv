Smith urging him not to downgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s newly built hospital, citing readiness and training issues.

Senator Hawley wrote, “I write with great concern over reports that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is considering downgrading the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital to a clinic. I urge you to reconsider this and ensure that Fort Leonard Wood keeps its newly built hospital.”

He continued, “As you are no doubt aware, the DHA also moved to downgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s hospital under the previous Administration. I demanded Secretary Austin reverse course then, and have continued to remain engaged on the issue. Downgrading this hospital would seriously harm soldiers, their families, and the broader community. It would jeopardize Fort Leonard Wood’s critical role as a major Army training center, including for Basic Combat Training and numerous advanced specialties.”

Senator Hawley concluded, “The DHA has previously considered downgrading this hospital as a cost savings measure, but in point of fact such a move would represent the abandonment of over $400 million in recent investments to upgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s medical facilities. It would also impose additional costs on servicemembers assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, who would have to travel long distances to receive anything more than outpatient services. A downgrade of this facility should not happen. I urge you to reconsider and reverse any determinations that have been made to do so. You must act to protect a hospital that is critical to servicemembers and constituents in my state.”

Dear Dr. Smith,

I write with great concern over reports that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is considering downgrading the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital to a clinic. I urge you to reconsider this and ensure that Fort Leonard Wood keeps its newly built hospital.

As you are no doubt aware, the DHA also moved to downgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s hospital under the previous Administration. I demanded Secretary Austin reverse course then, and have continued to remain engaged on the issue.

Downgrading this hospital would seriously harm soldiers, their families, and the broader community. It would jeopardize Fort Leonard Wood’s critical role as a major Army training center, including for Basic Combat Training and numerous advanced specialties.

The DHA has previously considered downgrading this hospital as a cost savings measure, but in point of fact such a move would represent the abandonment of over $400 million in recent investments to upgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s medical facilities. It would also impose additional costs on servicemembers assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, who would have to travel long distances to receive anything more than outpatient services.

A downgrade of this facility should not happen. I urge you to reconsider and reverse any determinations that have been made to do so. You must act to protect a hospital that is critical to servicemembers and constituents in my state.

Sincerely,

Josh Hawley

U.S. Senator

Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland (WA-10) is leading a bipartisan push to improve maternal health care for military families through expanded access to midwifery services. In recognition of the International Day of the Midwife, Strickland reintroduced the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act, a bill aimed at broadening maternity care options for servicemembers and their families enrolled in TRICARE.

“It is our job to support our servicemembers, and this includes providing help before, during and after childbirth,” said Strickland. “This bill expands midwifery care options, giving servicemembers and their families the care that they deserve.”

The legislation, co-led by Reps. Emily Randall (WA-06), Juan Ciscomani (AZ-06), and Jen Kiggans (VA-02), reflects a bipartisan commitment to expanding maternity care options for military families.

The proposed bill creates a five-year pilot program within TRICARE to cover services provided by credentialed midwives, with the goal of making that coverage permanent.

“Sexual and reproductive health care is essential, and we have a responsibility to ensure that service members and their families can access the care they deserve,” said Randall. “Expanding midwifery services through TRICARE is a critical step toward closing the dangerous gaps in maternal health care that too many people — especially those who serve our nation — are forced to navigate.”

The legislation has received endorsements from major national organizations including the American Association of Birth Centers, American College of Nurse Midwives, and the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM), among others. Advocates emphasize that the bill will help meet the growing demand for community-based maternal care and support military families in underserved areas.

“The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act directly addresses a critical gap in maternity care for military families by expanding TRICARE to include all credentialed midwives. By recognizing Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives as authorized providers, this bill not only increases access to care, especially in underserved areas, but also affirms the right of military families to choose safe community-based care,” said Cassaundra Jah, Executive Director of NACPM. “With over half of U.S. birth centers staffed by CPMs, this legislation will dramatically expand access to midwifery-led birth center services. NACPM strongly supports this bill as a meaningful, evidence-based solution that honors the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of our nation’s servicemembers and their families.”

Ciscomani, a father of six, spoke to the unique challenges faced by military families during pregnancy and childbirth.

“As our troops and their families serve our nation, they deserve access to the very best care, especially if they are looking to start or expand their family,” said Ciscomani. “As a dad of six I can tell you, planning to welcome a child to your family is an exciting time. However, serving in the military or having a spouse in uniform can pose additional difficulties for mothers-to-be. This is why I once again joined Rep. Strickland in a bipartisan effort to expand access to midwifery care for military spouses and women in uniform who are enrolled in TRICARE to ensure they can receive the care they need.”

Kiggans, a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, emphasized the importance of improving health outcomes for military families while easing the burden on the military health system.

“As a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, I know firsthand the importance of high-quality, accessible maternal care for our military families,” said Kiggans. “The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act is a commonsense, data-driven solution that expands care options under TRICARE, improves outcomes for mothers and babies, and helps reduce strain on military healthcare systems. I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to better support those who serve by delivering the care they and their families deserve.”",https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/local-pic-Marilyn-Strickland-Official-Photo_0.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-14 12:57:05.318033

The company will celebrate on social media, sharing patient and provider stories that highlight the impact NeuroStar has as a safe, effective, and non-drug treatment for depression

MALVERN, Pa., May 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuronetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STIM), a vertically integrated, commercial stage, medical technology and healthcare company with a strategic vision of transforming the lives of patients whenever and wherever they need help, with the leading neurohealth therapies in the world, is proud to launch the first National TMS Therapy Awareness Day. The event will take place each year on May 14 during May's Mental Health Awareness Month. This day is dedicated to raising awareness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a proven, non-drug treatment option for individuals living with major depressive disorder (MDD), depression with anxiety, and OCD, especially those who have not found relief through antidepressants.

""National TMS Awareness Day is about giving hope to people who haven't found relief and being a driving force in the National Mental Health Awareness conversation,” said Keith Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Neuronetics. ""Far too many individuals feel stuck or discouraged after trying multiple antidepressants without receiving adequate relief from their symptoms. By launching this National Day, we want to raise awareness that non-medication approaches like NeuroStar TMS therapy exist-and they're helping real people reclaim their lives. Our goal is to make sure every patient, caregiver, and provider knows that effective, non-drug treatments are available and within reach.”

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was first cleared by the FDA in 2008 for treatment-resistant depression in adults. Since then, it has become a widely adopted, evidence-backed modality for those who haven't responded to medication intervention. NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy in the United States-and in 2024, NeuroStar also received FDA clearance for use in adolescents, expanding access to younger patients in need of non-drug treatment options. Over 300 million people have insurance plans that cover NeuroStar TMS therapy, including Medicare and Tricare.

""One of the reasons NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy is the precision of our technology,” said Geoffrey Grammer, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Neuronetics. ""Our unique coil design is built to deliver focused magnetic pulses exactly where they're needed. Combined with our Contact Sensing feature, this ensures every session is both consistent and effective, helping patients get the most out of their treatment. We take pride in our scientific and engineering rigor, which continues to advance the field of TMS therapy and enhance the lives of our patients. On National TMS Therapy Awareness Day, we celebrate the real-world impact of NeuroStar TMS Therapy and the difference it makes.”

Kristen Gingrich, a licensed clinical social worker, mother, and patient advocate, has documented her experience with NeuroStar TMS after struggling with depression since her teens-worsened by postpartum challenges. After trying talk therapy and multiple antidepressants without lasting relief, she turned to NeuroStar TMS and is now sharing her treatment journey during Mental Health Awareness Month. Kristen's story, which can be seen on both her account (@notyouraveragethrpst) and NeuroStar social media channels, helps shine a light about non-drug options and inspire others facing similar struggles to seek help.

In addition to founding this awareness day, NeuroStar TMS continues its legacy as the leading TMS device company by presenting data at the 2025 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting (May 17-21). The poster ""The Profile of Symptom Change with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder” builds on prior research and evaluates TMS protocols and their treatment efficacy.

The Pentagon has officially halted gender-affirming care for active duty military personnel in accordance with an executive order from President Trump that demands the firing of any member of the United States military who has received a diagnosis of, or treatment for, gender dysphoria, according to Reuters.

The memo seen by Reuters is alleged to have “barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops,” even though TRICARE, the healthcare provider for active duty military personnel in America, has long refused to cover gender-affirming surgeries in most cases.

Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, is alleged to have instructed in the memo that the recipients “immediately implement this guidance.” When asked for comment, the Pentagon directed Reuters to speak with the Defense Health Agency, who facilitate healthcare services for the armed forces. The DHA had not responded to Reuters’ request for comment before publication.

This news comes on the heels of another memo Reuters obtained last week in which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth demanded that the Pentagon start forcibly separating active duty transgender troops who had not left on their own by June 6. Troops in the armed forces reserves had until July 7th to voluntarily separate. On this memo, too, the Pentagon provided no comment. Hegseth simply tweeted, “No More Trans @ DoD.”

According to Reuters, officials have estimated that there are 4,240 transgender troops in the US military. This figure is somewhat contentious: activists defending trans rights often estimate higher, and in 2018 the now defunct Palm Center UCSB think tank estimated that there were 14,707 transgender Americans serving in the armed forces; 8,980 active duty, and another 5,727 in the reserves. There are approximately 2.86 million military personnel in the United States, meaning even the highest estimates of transgender troops account for less than half of one percent of all troops. How such a small minority could possibly compromise military readiness, as the Trump administration insists they do, is unclear.

The battle over transgender troops has been waged in federal courts since Trump’s executive order was issued in January, with two separate federal judges issuing sweeping pauses on the separation of transgender troops from the military. Unfortunately, last week the Supreme Court rubber stamped a request from the Trump administration to let them carry on firing transgender military personnel and denying them healthcare, and determine the constitutionality of that maneuver at a later date. The issued approval was one page, provided no explanation of the conservative justices’ rationale, and noted that the progressive judges dissented.

This is just the latest move in Trump’s war on inclusivity in the military. Over the weekend, leaders at the Pentagon were instructed to identify and remove materials that promote “divisive concepts and gender ideology.”

It’s unclear exactly how these separations will be processed, and whether or not transgender troops who are separated from the military, involuntarily or otherwise, will retain access to benefits such as the GI Bill or VA healthcare. In particular, new guidance on trans healthcare at the VA last month declared that no new patients for gender dysphoria treatment would be accepted, but that active duty troops accessing gender affirming-care through TRICARE who then separated from the military and qualified for care through the VA would be eligible to transition their treatment plan to the VA. The Pentagon has provided no answers on whether or not these rules are still in place, so eager are they to purge transgender Americans from military service.

Whatever you think about our armed forces, I find it deeply upsetting that thousands of trans people will be unemployed, homeless and possibly without healthcare in the next 30 to 60 days. Discrimination against trans people in housing and employment is on the rise, after all. Besides that, I simply cannot stomach the notion of transgender Americans being systematically excluded from any group that cisgender Americans have free access to; this is, it should go without saying, one of the first steps down a very scary road.

We’ve lost this battle. I hope we can win the war.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/633303d5ccf756402b93f25c/t/68243c21f9c8016586004746/1747205153545/671ac29ac65b23.00193110.png?format=1500w,N,-1.0,2025-05-14 06:56:21.985636

The 81st Medical Group on Keesler Air Force Base, Miss., the 673rd Medical Group on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, and Brooke Army Medical Center on Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, are among the 16 military hospitals that received top honors for their excellence in transparency and delivery of safe, high-quality care.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade, according to a DHA release.

KEESLER KUDOS

This year marks Keesler Medical Center’s second consecutive year on Leapfrog’s “honor roll.”

The 81st Medical Group maintains medical readiness for worldwide contingencies by providing quality, cost-effective health care for more than 27,000 enrollees, including almost 7,500 active-duty members. It also oversees five military treatment facilities from Mobile, Alabama, to New Orleans, Louisiana, coordinating care for 80,000 beneficiaries along the Gulf Coast.

“This accomplishment marks a significant milestone for our hospital,” said Air Force Col. Peter Kulis, commander of the 81st Medical Group and director of Keesler Medical Center. “Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do — from the smallest interaction to the most critical decisions. I’m deeply proud of our team, whose commitment and excellence ensure our patients receive the safest, highest-quality care possible.”

NORTHERN STARS

This year marks JBER’s third consecutive time scoring an “A” grade.

JBER hospital, fondly known as “J-Bear,” is a joint venture between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs that offers primary, specialty, outpatient, and inpatient care to 25,000 enrolled beneficiaries in the Anchorage area.

“Our third consecutive ‘A’ grade from Leapfrog is a direct reflection of the relentless commitment our Airmen and staff demonstrate every day to patient safety, high-reliability practices, and mission-ready care,” said Air Force Col. Laura Baugh, 673rd Medical Group commander. “This recognition belongs to the 673rd Medical Group team, whose discipline and dedication continue to set the standard for military medicine.”

BAMC BRILLIANCE

Brooke Army Medical Center also made the spring “honor roll.”

BAMC is the largest and most robust military hospital and the only Level I Trauma Center within the Department of Defense, providing safe, quality care to service members, their families, veterans, and civilian emergency patients.

BAMC serves more than 250,000 military beneficiaries within San Antonio and the surrounding communities. As a Level I Trauma Center, BAMC administers lifesaving care to civilian emergency patients from across 22 counties in Southwest Texas.

“BAMC is committed to providing our patients the best quality and safest care possible, and these results exemplify that commitment,” said Army Col. Kevin Kelly, BAMC commander. “We are very proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.”

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation is also intended to foster transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and healthcare systems, leading to continual process improvement.

Did Zynex Deceive Investors with Inflated Revenue Figures? Lawsuit Alleges Misleading Practices

The lawsuit contends that Zynex engaged in a scheme to inflate its reported revenue by routinely sending patients more products, including electrodes, than were medically necessary. This practice, the suit alleges, drew scrutiny from insurers, most notably Tricare, the health care program for active-duty and retired U.S. military personnel, potentially leading to adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

Concerns surrounding Zynex's business practices were amplified on June 4, 2024, with the publication of a report in the medical journal STAT. The report, titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" detailed what it described as an ""oversupplying scheme"" whereby Zynex allegedly sent excessive monthly supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to generate higher billings to insurers. Following the publication of the STAT report, Zynex's stock price reportedly fell by more than 5 percent.

The lawsuit further highlights Zynex's disclosure on March 11, 2025, when the company announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. In its report, Zynex revealed a significant revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter, attributed to slower payments from certain payers. The company also disclosed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments while it reviewed prior claims. This announcement triggered a sharp decline in Zynex's share price, plummeting by more than 51 percent, according to the legal filing.

Tricare Suspension Exacerbates Financial Woes: Post-Lawsuit Report Reveals Deepening Revenue and Profit Decline.

The financial repercussions of the Tricare payment suspension and the alleged prior practices became more evident after the lawsuit was filed. On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported a substantial decline in its first-quarter 2025 financial performance. Net revenue for the quarter plummeted to $26.6 million, a sharp decrease from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also saw its gross profit margin contract significantly, falling to 69 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 80 percent in the prior year. This downturn resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million for the quarter, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

During the subsequent earnings call, Zynex Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sandgaard directly addressed the TriCare payment suspension as a primary factor contributing to the disappointing first-quarter results. Mr. Sandgaard stated that the disruption had a significant impact on revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring effort to prepare for a potential prolonged halt in TriCare payments.

Looking ahead, Zynex has issued a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025 and anticipates an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.20. Reflecting the considerable uncertainty surrounding its relationship with TriCare, a key payer, the company has withheld its full-year financial guidance.

Hagens Berman's Launches Inquiry into Zynex's Disclosures Amidst Financial Turmoil

Shareholder rights law firm Hagens Berman has announced an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Zynex's recent financial disclosures and the allegations leveled in the class-action suit.

""Our investigation seeks to determine whether the company sufficiently revealed the potential pitfalls inherent in its billing methodologies and its dependence on TriCare's financial contributions,"" said Reed Kathrein, the partner spearheading the firm's probe.

That number is even higher for those who are serving or have served in the U.S. military, often due to the stress and trauma that service members endure.

If you are a military member or retiree, you and your family may be eligible for TRICARE, which covers many mental heath services. You do not have to suffer with mental health issues alone. Help is available.

What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE, a program of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System, provides civilian health benefits for military members, retirees, and their dependents. TRICARE offers several plan options depending on eligibility, but active military members are eligible for TRICARE Prime, which comes with few out of pocket costs.

Why Mental Health Services Matter

Often, people hesitate to seek mental health care, in part because of the stigma of mental illness. However, it’s important to recognize that people with mental health issues are not weak or defective. They simply suffer from a disorder that many other people also struggle with, and those disorders are treatable. With treatment, people with mental health disorders can get better and feel better and live more fulfilling lives. No one should suffer in silence when help is never more than a phone call away.

TRICARE Plan Options

TRICARE has seven main plan options.

TRICARE Prime: Prime is offered to active military members and their families and has the lowest out of pocket costs compared to other plans. It is similar to a health maintenance organization (HMO) plan and features the use of military hospitals and clinics.

TRICARE Select: Select is similar to a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan and allows you to choose your TRICARE providers. However, out of pocket costs with this plan are higher.

US Family Plan: The family plan is only available in certain areas and covers care only by their authorized providers. Care at military hospitals and clinics is not covered.

TRICARE Reserve Select: This plan is premium based and covers care with TRICARE authorized providers. It is available to Selected Reserve members and their families.

TRICARE Retired Reserve: Available to members of the Retired Reserve, this plan is similar to TRICARE Reserve Select.

TRICARE Young Adult: A premium based plan for young adult children of eligible military members. Prime or Select coverage may be chosen.

TRICARE For Life: A plan that supplements Medicare coverage.

Outpatient Mental Health Services Covered

Outpatient services are available at some military facilities and through TRICARE authorized providers. Some common outpatient services that are covered include:

Psychological testing and assessment

Psychotherapy

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) – Therapy several times per week

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs) – Daytime treatment, six or more hours a day, up to seven days a week

Inpatient Services Covered

Inpatient services covered include:

Inpatient hospital services for psychiatric emergencies and substance abuse withdrawal

Psychiatric residential treatment centers for children and adolescents

Mental Health Emergency Services

In the case of a mental health emergency, emergency room visits are covered as long as you contact TRICARE within 72 hours of admission. You can also call 988, the Veterans Crisis Line.

Common Mental Health Disorders Among Veterans

The most common mental health disorders among veterans are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.

PTSD is generally caused by one or more traumatic events that occurred while serving. Active duty service members often live through traumatic events, which is why nearly 25% of veterans who are cared for by VA services have had PTSD at some point in their lives. Symptoms of PTSD include flashbacks, severe anxiety, nightmares, and uncontrollable thoughts about the traumatic event or events.

Depression often occurs due to feelings of isolation after transitioning back to civilian life. Symptoms of depression include loss of interest in activities, persistent sadness, difficulty concentrating, and changes in appetite.

Anxiety is often caused by being consistently exposed to stressful situations while in service. Symptoms include constant worrying, restlessness, nervousness, difficulty concentrating, and rapid heartbeat.

Substance use disorders, which include alcohol and drug use disorders, are common as well, and often co-occur with other common mental health disorders among veterans. Bridges of Hope is a TRICARE authorized provider offering several treatment options for substance use disorders.

This list is not all-inclusive, so if you are suffering with symptoms that don’t fit these disorders, you should still seek mental health care. Everyone responds differently to the extreme stress and trauma associated with military service, so reach out for help no matter what you’re struggling with.

,,2025-05-13 23:42:59+00:00,Women's eNews,She Was Here: The Erasure of Women from America's Story,"Jean Kilbourne, Silvia Rodriguez Vega, Jacquese Armstrong, Yasmin Tarver",,,,,https://womensenews.org/2025/05/she-was-here-the-erasure-of-women-from-americas-story/,"Fortunately, two nonprofit organizations dedicated to telling women’s stories, the National Women’s History Museum and the National Women’s Hall of Fame, are not dependent on government funding.
The Hall will continue to tell their stories in its mission to combat the erasure of women’s contributions to the world.
In science and technology, this problem is so pervasive it has a name: the Matilda Effect—the systematic process of overlooking, miscrediting, or erasing women’s contributions to scientific achievement.
The term is named for 1995 National Women’s Hall of Fame Inductee Matilda Josyln Gage, who identified this bias as early as 1870 in her work as a suffragist and civil rights advocate.
Over three hundred women have been inducted into the Hall so far, each one with a powerful story.","On his very first day in office, President Donald Trump fired Admiral Linda Fagan, the first woman in American history to lead a branch of the armed forces. She was evicted from her residence with three hours’ notice. Weeks later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first female Chief of Naval Operations. Soon thereafter he fired Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, the senior military assistant to the secretary of defense, and then Telita Crosland, the former head of the military’s Defense Health Agency, forced to retire after a 32-year career.

The purge didn’t stop at leadership. At the same time, the Army and Navy removed all web pages that highlighted the history and contributions of female soldiers and sailors. A page entitled “Navy Women of Courage and Intelligence” was replaced by a “Page not found” message. The Pentagon has removed many thousands of posts about and photos of female military members.

The message is clear: women in power will no longer be recognized – or even tolerated.

It is not just military women who are being erased. Hundreds of federal government websites have removed any mention of women’s achievements and words such as “women,” “female,” and “feminism.” The White House released a list of words that National Institutes of Health grant seekers may no longer use, including “women.” Trump has also ordered NASA to eradicate all mention of women in leadership from its websites. In a term straight out of Brave New World, Trump refers to these acts as “defending women.” As he said at one of his rallies, he would be a protector of women “whether they like it or not.” This is especially ironic coming from a man who has been found liable for sexual assault by a jury of his peers and has been credibly accused of sexual abuse and harassment by over two dozen women.

We are fast living in a world in which women are becoming invisible (except as sex objects or baby machines) and our achievements are being erased. While it isn’t entirely true that “you cannot be what you cannot see,” it will certainly become more difficult for girls to believe they can be anything they want to be–-and for boys to grow up respecting girls and women. “If you erase the memory, we really forget the people,” said Alessio Ponzio, a visiting professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland. “It’s an act of violence that is very subtle but can really destroy the psychology of people. Basically, ‘I’m telling you that I do not recognize you.'”

In the words of author Lydia Millet, “Storytelling will never be the same as action. But action depends on a perception of possibility, which only arises from the tales we tell ourselves.” I would add that the perception of possibility also arises from the tales we are told by others. We must fight back by telling the stories of women who have done exceptional things, often in the face of discrimination and oppression. In recent years, museums have increasingly told these stories–but museums, even ones as iconic as the Smithsonian, are now being overhauled to revert to a historical lens that leaves out the women and people of color who shaped our nation.

Women have always been almost nonexistent in public artwork. Less than seven percent of national monuments honor women. As Rebeca Solnit said in “City of Women,” “A horde of dead men . . . haunt New York City and almost every city in the Western world.”

In the spring of 2024, President Joe Biden issued an executive order instructing the National Park Service to “highlight important figures and chapters in women’s history.” “Women and girls of all backgrounds have shaped our country’s history, from the ongoing fight for justice and equality to cutting-edge scientific advancements and artistic achievements,” the announcement read. “Yet these contributions have often been overlooked. We must do more to recognize the role of women and girls in America’s story, including through the Federal Government’s recognition and interpretation of historic and cultural sites.” If you attempt to find this order on a government website, you will find “Page not found.” The Trump administration has completely undone this order and seems to be in the process of undoing the National Park Service altogether.

Fortunately, two nonprofit organizations dedicated to telling women’s stories, the National Women’s History Museum and the National Women’s Hall of Fame, are not dependent on government funding. The Museum’s “ultimate vision is a more representative history and a more collective future, ensuring women’s history is an integral part of American history.”

The mission of the Hall is to advance gender equity (a phrase removed from all government websites) through action, education, and storytelling. In spite of the name, only about ten percent of women in the Hall are famous. The overwhelming majority are women who have groundbreaking accomplishments but are most often not recognized or celebrated outside of their particular fields. Women like Oveta Culp Hobby, the first director of the Women’s Army Corps and the first female to attain the rank of United States Colonel, and Sheila Widnall, the first female Secretary of the Air Force. The Hall will continue to tell their stories in its mission to combat the erasure of women’s contributions to the world.

This epidemic of erasure isn’t new—and it isn’t limited to the current administration. Many are familiar with famous female authors writing under male pseudonyms as a workaround for gender discrimination.

In science and technology, this problem is so pervasive it has a name: the Matilda Effect—the systematic process of overlooking, miscrediting, or erasing women’s contributions to scientific achievement. The term is named for 1995 National Women’s Hall of Fame Inductee Matilda Josyln Gage, who identified this bias as early as 1870 in her work as a suffragist and civil rights advocate. Yes, 1870!

Why have most Americans never heard of Dr. Patricia Bath, the first person to develop laser cataract surgery? Or Alice Evans, a scientist whose work led to mandatory milk pasteurization, saving countless lives worldwide. Or of Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet Nation who fought for Native American rights? Or of Bessie Coleman, the first Black female aviator? Or of St. Katharine Drexel, an American-born saint who dedicated her life and fortune to aid Native Americans and Black Americans? Why isn’t Margaret Fuller, author and journalist, taught in literature classes alongside her colleagues Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathanial Hawthorne?

Over three hundred women have been inducted into the Hall so far, each one with a powerful story. Now, more than ever, we must be sure that these stories are told. As Cecile Richards said, “Stories, told and retold, are the key to igniting change.”

So, tell them. Share them. Fund the institutions that preserve them, and refuse to let those who would erase our history win.",https://womensenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/why-womens-hall-of-fame.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-13 19:56:27.200022

The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.
“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch.
Using military dental clinics In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics.
Regular dental care for children supports not only their oral health, but their overall well-being.","Did you know that oral health has important links to your overall health? That’s why it’s especially important that children get proper dental care from an early age. This helps them maintain healthy teeth and gums throughout their lives.

Luckily, the TRICARE Dental Program, administered by United Concordia, has you covered. The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.

“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch. “It ensures your child has access to high-quality dental care that helps establish healthy habits early.”

Automatic enrollment at age 1

The TDP automatically enrolls your child in your dental plan when they turn age 1, if there’s a family member currently enrolled. This enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following your child’s birthday.

It’s important to be proactive with your child’s oral health in the early stages. Bring your child to their first dental appointment after their first tooth appears, but no later than their first birthday. Most babies’ teeth start to grow in at around 4 to 6 months old.

If you had a single plan before your child turned 1, your premium will change from the single plan rate to the family plan rate when your child is enrolled.

Costs

Your TDP monthly premiums are based on your sponsor’s status, rank and your enrollment type. Enrollment types include:

• Sponsor only

• Single enrollment (one family member, not sponsor)

• Family enrollment (more than one family member, not sponsor)

• Sponsor and family

Your cost-shares depend on your sponsor’s pay grade and where you live.

Coverage duration

Children can keep their TDP coverage until the end of the month they turn 23 if they:

• Are unmarried

• Attend an approved institution of higher education full-time

• Get at least half their financial support from their military sponsor

If your child stops meeting any of these conditions before turning 23, their coverage ends at the end of the month the change occurs. Additionally, if your child doesn’t meet these conditions at age 21, they’ll lose TRICARE coverage.

Services covered by TDP

The TDP covers a wide range of dental services for children, as described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook:

• Regular checkups and cleanings

• X-rays and evaluations

• Fluoride treatments

• Sealants for cavity prevention

• Fillings and restorations

• Orthodontics (braces) when medically necessary

• Emergency dental care

Most children can receive two routine teeth cleanings and two topical fluoride applications every 12 months. Your dentist can recommend the right schedule for your child’s needs.

Service frequency

The TDP provides coverage based on the following timeframes:

Every 12 months:

• Two oral checkups

• One set of bitewing X-rays

• Two routine cleanings

• Two fluoride applications

Every 36 months:

• One full mouth X-ray

• Sealants on permanent molars through age 18

Finding a dentist

To find a CONUS dentist, search the United Concordia network. If you’re overseas, use the OCONUS Find a Dentist tool.

Using military dental clinics

In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics. But in certain situations, they may. These situations include:

Emergencies

Certain special dental cases in children

Dental work related to treatment received at a military hospital or clinic

Your family members may be able to use overseas military dental clinics if they have space available. Check with your local overseas military dental clinic to find out what services they offer.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.
The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said.
Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.","The Pentagon is halting gender-affirming health care for transgender troops as it moves to implement President Donald Trump's plan to kick them out of the U.S. military, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.

“I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,” Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in the memo.

The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights said that the abrupt termination of healthcare was “needlessly disrespectful and cruel.”

“It is shameful that our nation’s military would treat any service member this way,” Minter said.

One transgender service member, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted, called the decision “the latest slap in the face” to troops serving honorably.

“If there was any doubt left, there is not anymore: transgender service members are no longer entitled to the same standard of medical care as their peers,” the service member said.

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 6 permitted Trump’s administration to implement his ban on transgender people in the military, allowing the armed forces to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out.

Reuters first reported last week a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6.

There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates.

Trump signed an executive order in January, after returning to the presidency, that reversed a policy implemented under his predecessor Joe Biden that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly.

A Gallup poll published in February found that 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals to serve in the military, but the support had declined from 71% in 2019.

A former Fox News host, Hegseth has embraced conservative stances on culture war issues, including eliminating diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.

Re-posting an article that said the Pentagon would resume treatments for transgender troops, Hegseth said: “If this is true — we will find any way possible to stop it.”

“Taxpayers should NEVER pay for this lunacy,” Hegseth added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/350513-us-soldier-silhouette-mn-1045-071967.jpg",N,0.0,2025-05-13 17:56:54.997532

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Heroes show their true colors when devastation hits.

When Hurricane Helene swept through the southeastern United States in 2024, it was the deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in almost 20 years.

Troy Akers, a physician and chief of emergency medicine at Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia, showed the world what real-world heroes look like in the storm’s aftermath.

Because of his heroism, Akers was named the 2025 Civilian Hero of Military Medicine in a ceremony on May 8, 2025.

The award recognizes Akers for his outstanding leadership, dedication to taking care of patients, and commitment to improving military medical practices.

""Dr. Troy Akers is a great example of the kind of dedicated person we are lucky to have in our unique health system,"" said Dr. David Smith, acting director of the Defense Health Agency.

Akers showed how he embodies selfless service during Hurricane Helene. Even though his own home was damaged, he focused on the needs of the community and the patients first.

""He grabbed a chainsaw and cut his way out of his home and local area so that he could reach the hospital. Which is where he stayed – around the clock – for the next eight days,"" Smith said. ""Dr. Akers stepped forward and made sure all patients were safely moved.""

The storm caused extensive damage, and the hospital lost power and water, forcing the evacuation of over 30 service members, family members, and civilians.

Akers coordinated the safe transfer of patients, including the critically ill, and worked with other hospitals to ensure everyone got the medical care they needed. He also led the effort to get the hospital back up and running after the storm.

Smith added, ""This is what leadership looks like during a crisis. These are the actions of someone who has the qualities we want: calmness, confidence, and caring for those he serves.""

Besides his leadership in emergencies, Akers is committed to teaching and training. He created a training program to improve skills for handling high-risk medical situations, benefiting over 250 health care workers.

Leaders at DDEAMC praised Akers for making the DDEAMC Emergency Room one of the best in the military health system. Akers focused on making things better, they said, which helped the department exceed national standards.

“With his leadership, DDEAMC was the first DHA medical center to create an emergency department team of DHA civilian interfacility transport paramedics,” said Col. (Dr.) Mark Craig, DDEAMC’s deputy commander for clinical services, when recommending Akers for the award.

“During times of chaos, such as Hurricane Helene, I witnessed his heroic efforts firsthand,” Craig added. “His commitment extends beyond daily responsibilities, showcasing remarkable resilience in catastrophic situations.”

A veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, Akers previously served on active duty in the U.S. Army as an emergency medicine physician. During a deployment to Afghanistan as the flight surgeon for Task Force Viper, he took part in over 200 combat missions, often while under direct fire. He improved how patients were evacuated, saving lives, and for his actions, received the Bronze Star Medal. He was also named the 2011 Flight Surgeon of the Year by the Army Aviation Association of America.

""There are many ways to serve your country, and Troy Akers is a perfect example,” said Smith.

Akers clearly began serving his country when he first raised his right hand and swore to defend the nation, and he continues to live by that oath now.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9032722/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-13 13:56:24.409755

When I told the Tricare rep I wanted to do that she said that wasn't allowed and they could only talk to provider claims.","Update: I spoke to Tricare again and was able to get somewhere. We added one of the providers onto the call, and discovered that Tricare has switched their claims center from Wisconsin to South Carolina. My provider was unaware and had mailed my claim to Wisconsin. If anyone else in the east region is having a similar issue, I can provide the new address, fax number, and payer ID that your provider will need to submit a claim to the right location.

Thank you to whoever takes the time to read this. I've been having an absolutey awful time with Humana military/Tricare east this year, after 3 previous years with no trouble.

I have 3 providers after me for a combined total of 30,000 in medical bills that should be Tricare's responsibility. Two of these are providers I have been seeing for years with no issues.

I talk to their billing departments and go over how the claim was submitted, making sure they use my correct benefits number and other personal info. They resubmit the claims, and Tricare comes back and says something to the effect of ""patient could not be identified as ours"".

So I call Tricare. They are adamant that I am insured, evidenced by the claims that have been approved this year, some from the same providers on the same day as the one that are getting denied. They saiy it is an issue with how the providers are submitting the claim.

I can see the approved claims in my EOB, but the denied claims don't show up at all. I got claim numbers from the providers and asked Tricare about them and they said they had no record of them.

The providers are adamant that the claims are submitted correctly. One even offered to go on a 3 way call with me to try to get it straightened out. When I told the Tricare rep I wanted to do that she said that wasn't allowed and they could only talk to provider claims.

Now I feel backed into a corner with no idea what to do next and terrified these bills will fall on me. What can I do next at this point in the process?

I haven't been sent to collections yet but one of the providers is starting to get a little more aggressive.",,N,-1.0,2025-05-13 14:56:37.134743

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts. “This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees. “Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

Javier’s forward-thinking approach is setting a new standard for training innovation within military medicine. Her efforts are not only advancing individual proficiency but also ensuring that JBER’s surgical technologists are better prepared for any operational challenge.

“Her leadership has created a model for future partnerships,” said Col. Laura Baugh, commander 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier embodies the spirit of excellence, and her work will have a lasting impact on the future of military medical training.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9030512.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-13 15:56:36.154285

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022.
“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt.

Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health.","SAN DIEGO, Calif. — Naval Medical Center San Diego held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the expansion of its 1 West inpatient mental health ward—an initiative that marks a significant step forward in strengthening behavioral health care for active duty service members, veterans, and beneficiaries.

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022. Through a coordinated vision shared among leadership, clinical departments, facilities staff, and safety experts, the project was brought to life with the goal of increasing access, improving therapeutic outcomes, and reinforcing the Navy’s commitment to warfighter readiness.

""When our service members are struggling, it affects not only their individual readiness but the collective strength of our force,"" said Rear Adm. Guido Valdes, Commander, Naval Medical Forces Pacific, and Director, Defense Health Network Pacific Rim. ""By delivering high-quality, evidence-based mental health services in a secure and supportive environment, this unit will ensure our warfighters receive the care they need to recover and return to duty—or transition with dignity to the next phase of their lives.""

The newly expanded 1 West ward moves NMCSD closer to its goal of increasing capacity from a historic 36-bed limit across the 1 North and 1 West units to a total of 48 beds by the end of the calendar year. The initiative is expected to eliminate active-duty disengagements to civilian care, improve engagement with veterans and beneficiaries, and generate an estimated $22.7 million in annual purchased care savings once all 24 new beds are staffed and in use.

“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt. Elizabeth Adriano, Director of NMCSD. “By retaining our service members in a military treatment facility, we preserve readiness, reduce costly external placements, and expand care access to those who have served and continue to serve.”

The original 1 West ward was last renovated in 2008, primarily to meet updated safety requirements. The current expansion project not only reinforces safety standards with structural upgrades—including ligature-resistant door hardware, lock replacements, and improved CCTV—but also places a strong emphasis on enhancing the therapeutic environment. Patients now benefit from access to a large outdoor courtyard, greater privacy, and improved treatment areas that support individualized care.

Additionally, the Program of Care has been refined to offer tailored therapeutic experiences, aligning treatment groups and clinical interventions with each patient’s specific diagnosis and symptom profile.

“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care—it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said. Cmdr. Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health. ""In addition, the expansion allows us to accept and treat a more diverse group of patients, which directly serves our multiple training programs, including the Navy’s largest psychiatric residency.”

The project’s success was the result of a joint plan of action and milestones developed by the Directorate for Mental Health and the Directorate of Nursing Services, encompassing hiring initiatives, infrastructure improvements, space reorganization, and key procurement milestones.

The ribbon-cutting event highlighted the collective dedication and vision of the NMCSD team to deliver high-quality, mission-aligned behavioral health services that preserve the force, support families, and promote holistic well-being.

To address this, the Department of Defense offers behavioral health care—such as treatment for depression or substance use—through its TRICARE health program.

Participants can seek this care from private providers, who then must submit claims to be paid for it. Our work included looking at how quickly DOD contractors processed claims from behavioral health providers for care delivered from 2018 through 2023.

These claims were generally processed as quickly as other types of claims, with almost 90% processed within 30 days.

What GAO Found

The Department of Defense's (DOD) two managed care support contractors generally processed TRICARE claims for care provided between 2018 and 2023 within required timeliness standards. The claims process involves determining payment amounts to civilian health care providers, including behavioral health providers. DOD's timeliness standards require contractors to process 98 percent of TRICARE claims within 30 days, and 100 percent of claims within 90 days.

Although DOD does not apply these standards to specific provider types, GAO separately analyzed the nearly 28 million claims from behavioral health providers over the 6-year period. GAO found that almost 90 percent were processed in 30 days. In addition, the percentage of claims processed within 30 and 90 days generally increased each year (see figure for the 3 most recent years).

Time to Process TRICARE Claims Submitted by Behavioral Health Providers for Care Provided in Calendar Years 2021-2023, by Managed Care Support Contractor

To oversee TRICARE payment accuracy, DOD monitored internal and external audit reports of randomly sampled claims from all types of providers, including behavioral health providers. DOD assessed contractor performance on all audited claims against the payment accuracy standards—which require payment error rates to not exceed between 2 and 1.75 percent, depending on the year of the contract—and took action when necessary. Across the audit reports from 2018 through 2023, claims from behavioral health providers made up between 1 and 8 percent of audited claims.

DOD's oversight actions were consistent with its oversight goal for early identification and resolution of performance issues, and with a recommended practice from the Office of Management and Budget and prior GAO work that federal agencies use multiple sources of evidence to support decision-making.

Why GAO Did This Study

To support military deployments and provide health care, including behavioral health care, DOD operates a health system known as TRICARE. This system offers behavioral health and other services to over nine million eligible beneficiaries in military hospitals and clinics, or through authorized civilian providers in the private sector.

The Conference Report 118-301 accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 includes a provision for GAO to report on TRICARE's payments to civilian network behavioral health providers. This report examines (1) the timeliness of TRICARE claims processing and (2) DOD's oversight of payment accuracy to all civilian providers, including behavioral health providers.

GAO reviewed relevant documents, such as DOD and contractor reports for timeliness and accuracy, and DOD's oversight plans for the TRICARE contracts. GAO also analyzed time frames for processing claims from behavioral health providers from 2018 through 2023 and audit findings on payment accuracy. Finally, GAO interviewed DOD officials with oversight responsibilities of TRICARE's contractors, contractor staff, and four selected behavioral health provider groups who participate in TRICARE. GAO compared DOD's oversight activities to a DOD goal and a recommended practice.

Meet Adrian De-Heer

Adrian, 69 years-young, lives with his wife Ingrid at TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Community and they love it!

“TriCare Compton Gardens in Aspley, Brisbane is like a Dutch village from my childhood—compact (but adequate) homes, close to everywhere and everything, convenient, near the bus-stop, with no-one ever complaining,” Adrian said.

“Indeed, the people are very friendly!”

“We always said we would never live in one of those villages where the homes are too big for our life stage—we want to travel overseas and visit our children and grandchildren, not worry about our house needing more work.”

Adrian left the Netherlands aged 26 with his wife, chasing their desire for warmth and the palm trees of the South Pacific.

“We left our Dutch village and emigrated without any real knowledge of what to expect.

We were running from the Cold War, the freezing weather, and economic downturn,” he said.

Adrian’s search first led to New Zealand—a country with temperate weather rather than heat, and far fewer tropical palm trees than he was expecting!

“We emigrated to New Zealand and found ourselves bunking in with another Dutch couple in a caravan in April at Hawke’s Bay and freezing every night,” Adrian said.

“We eventually found what we wanted in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia instead of New Zealand! But back then, there was no internet to search things up.”

Home At Last

Adrian and Ingrid finally settled in sunny, warm and tropical Brisbane and raised three children while owning and running a printing business which was sold 15 years ago.

“We had to be handy as well as resourceful in our printing business,” Adrian said.

“Running a business requires you have to get very good at finding fixes. Machines break down, parts break, and you have to find a way to fix them within your means.”

“I would say it kept me sharp and resourceful after all these years!”

Cyclone Alfred Blows In

As Cyclone Alfred approached the south-east Queensland coast the TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Village in Aspley Brisbane experienced some strong wind gusts.

When a particularly strong gust blew his neighbour, Michael’s fixed skylight right off, Adrian was able to come to the rescue!

“With a big hole in his roof, Michael was worried about internal water damage,” Adrian said.

He’d called the SES (State Emergency Service) but many people were needing SES assistance at that time.

With the cyclone looming closer the rain increased and Michael’s buckets and towels could not capture the water pouring inside.

Michael gave me a call to see if I could help and I thought, I have just the thing!”

Adrian then armed himself with a good ole’ Bunnings umbrella, braved the crazy winds and rain to reach Michael’s home and climbed a ladder to inspect the damage.

“Sure enough, the umbrella fit perfectly between the broken part of the skylight and was successful in keeping the rain out of Michael’s home,” Adrian said.

A Humble Hero

Adrian certainly didn’t expect to become a TriCare hero but he is chuffed that his quick thinking was able to save Michael’s cherished home in the retirement village from flooding!

He admitted at the time he didn’t think much of the heroic act.

“I was a little overwhelmed by the reaction—I know anyone else in our Village would have done the same to help out,” he said.

“I’m just glad that the Bunnings umbrella did its job until the SES team arrived to fix the roof.”

The Power of Community at Compton Gardens Retirement Living Village

A sense of community and helping others are important values for Adrian. It was a key factor in why he and Ingrid chose to move to the TriCare’s Retirement Living Community at Aspley village 18 months ago.

“Living at TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Community has been one of the best decisions we’ve made. From the moment we moved in, we felt embraced by the warm and welcoming community that truly feels like home, the fellowship is wonderful,” said Adrian.

“There are so many positives to retirement living—being part of a greater community and living with like-minded people is such a benefit.”

One of the standout features at Compton Gardens Retirement Living Community is the bustling social calendar and neighbourhood.

“There’s always something happening—from happy hours and games evenings to movie nights and monthly concerts featuring jazz bands and local school choirs.

“These events provide wonderful opportunities to connect with fellow residents and build lasting friendships. We’re certainly having a great time here,” said Adrian.

“From aqua aerobics classes to tai chi sessions, it’s great to have such a wide range of activities to help us maintain our health and independence… and keep us busy!”

However, one of Adrian’s favourite things to do these days is monitoring the weather and keeping an umbrella handy in case of an emergency!",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/05/1000002809-e1747110992909.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-13 04:56:20.423712

""If this is true - we will find any way possible to stop it,"" Hegseth responded to reports on the resumption of such treatments.","Per Reuters, the Pentagon has referred all questions about this change in policy to the Defense Health Agency, which has so far not responded to requests for clarification.

This comes after a recent decision by the US Supreme Court that allowed Trump's administration to enforce a ban on transgender people in the military.

The ruling allows armed forces to discharge existing transgender personnel and reject new recruits while legal disputes continue.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has commanded the removal of transgender troops who don't voluntarily leave by June 6.

The order was disclosed in a memo accessed by Reuters last week.

Officials said there are currently 4,240 active-duty and National Guard transgender personnel in the US military.

However, transgender rights advocates believe the number is much higher than what official estimates claim.

In January, Trump signed an executive order reversing a policy of his predecessor, Joe Biden.

The earlier policy had ensured transgender troops could serve openly in the military.

A Gallup poll in February had found 58% of Americans in favor of open service by transgender people in the military. However, it was a drop from 71% in 2019.

Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host known for his hardline stance on cultural issues, has been a vocal opponent of gender-affirming care for transgender troops.

“As our troops and their families serve our nation, they deserve access to the very best care, especially if they are looking to start or expand their family,” said Ciscomani. “As a dad of six I can tell you, planning to welcome a child to your family is an exciting time. However, serving in the military or having a spouse in uniform can pose additional difficulties for mothers-to-be. This is why I once again joined Rep. Strickland in a bipartisan effort to expand access to midwifery care for military spouses and women in uniform who are enrolled in TRICARE to ensure they can receive the care they need.”

“Sexual and reproductive health care is essential, and we have a responsibility to ensure that service members and their families can access the care they deserve,” said Randall. “Expanding midwifery services through TRICARE is a critical step toward closing the dangerous gaps in maternal health care that too many people — especially those who serve our nation— are forced to navigate.”

“As a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, I know firsthand the importance of high-quality, accessible maternal care for our military families,” said Kiggans. “The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act is a commonsense, data-driven solution that expands care options under TRICARE, improves outcomes for mothers and babies, and helps reduce strain on military healthcare systems. I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to better support those who serve by delivering the care they and their families deserve.”

The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act is endorsed by: American Association of Birth Centers (AABC), American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM), Birth Center Equity (BCE), Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery (PICBM), True North Birth Center, and the National Partnership on Women and Families.

“As a retired military spouse, a mother who relied on TRICARE during my own pregnancies, and a midwife who has supported countless families, I know firsthand the unique challenges military families face. Being restationed—sometimes well into pregnancy—often means starting over and scrambling to find a new provider in areas already facing serious shortages. For the past year and a half, I’ve been advocating for a solution which has become The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act. Midwives provide safe, evidence-based, and compassionate care that meets families where they are. This bill will not only improve continuity of care for military families—it will expand access to high-quality maternity care nationwide. I’m deeply grateful to Representatives Strickland, Ciscomani, Randall, and all the supporters of this bill for recognizing the urgent need to better serve our nation’s heroes and their loved ones—no matter where duty takes them,” said Ashley Jones, Licensed Midwife and Executive Director of True North Birth Center please.

“The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act directly addresses a critical gap in maternity care for military families by expanding TRICARE to include all credentialed midwives. By recognizing Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives as authorized providers, this bill not only increases access to care, especially in underserved areas, but also affirms the right of military families to choose safe community-based care. With over half of U.S. birth centers staffed by CPMs, this legislation will dramatically expand access to midwifery-led birth center services. NACPM strongly supports this bill as a meaningful, evidence-based solution that honors the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of our nation’s servicemembers and their families,” said Cassaundra Jah, Executive Director of the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives.

“The National Partnership for Women & Families applauds the reintroduction of the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act, which would provide more care options for servicemembers, especially ones that reside in rural or maternity care shortage areas,” said Amani Echols, Senior Manager for Maternal & Infant Health at the National Partnership for Women & Families. “Research shows that midwifery care provides equal or better care and outcomes compared to physician care on many fronts. For example, midwifery care results in higher rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, higher rates of breastfeeding, higher satisfaction with care, and lower overall costs. Passage of the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act is an integral step towards improving maternal and infant health.”

“Expanding midwifery coverage for service members is a lasting investment in families,” says Leseliey Welch, Co-Founder and CEO of Birth Center Equity. “Evidence shows that the midwifery model of care leads to excellent outcomes including lower rates of interventions like cesarean sections and episiotomies, and increased patient satisfaction. Midwifery care also emphasizes a personalized, relationship-centered approach, fostering trust and empowerment for the birthing person.” With this bill, says Welch, “we hope that more and more service members will gain access to birth centers, the only health care facilities based in the midwifery model of care.”

“The American Association of Birth Centers is proud to support the Midwives for Servicemembers Act. Expanding coverage to include certified professional midwives and certified midwives will significantly improve access to midwifery-led birth center care. We commend Rep. Marilyn Strickland, Rep. Emily Randall, Rep. Juan Ciscomani, and Rep. Jen Kiggans for their leadership in advancing high-quality maternity care for our service members and their families,” said Trinisha Williams, President of AABC.

“Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives at freestanding birth centers stand ready to serve military families, but Tricare doesn’t currently reimburse for their care. The Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery is deeply grateful to Congresswoman Strickland for introducing the Midwives for Service Members Act, which would ensure these nationally certified providers are reimbursed. As military hospitals close maternity units and care deserts grow, midwives and birth centers are vital to filling the gap and ensuring military families aren’t left without options, said Mary Lawlor, CPM, Executive Director, Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery.”

“The American College of Nurse-Midwives urges policymakers to support the Midwives for Service Members Act to ensure that military families have access to the full range of high-quality maternity care options, including midwifery services. Expanding access to certified midwives and certified professional midwives within the Military Health System is a cost-effective, evidence-based strategy to improve maternal health outcomes, enhance patient satisfaction, and address longstanding disparities in access to care for those who serve our country,” said Michelle Munroe, retired Army Colonel, and CEO of the American College of Nurse-Midwives",https://thesubtimes.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/TST-Featured-Image.png,N,0.0,2025-05-12 22:56:19.242465

As reported by HealthExec, in March the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it would stop providing gender-affirming care to former military personnel, ending coverage for hormone therapy. The agency said it never covered surgical interventions, thus no new ban was imposed.

However, when issuing its guidance, the VA said the change would only impact new enrollees. Those already receiving care would continue to have it covered. It’s unclear if these new directives at the DOD will impact that policy.

The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

Breen,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/eleventh-circuit-addresses-rule-9b-heightened-pleading-standard-false-claims-act,"The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss.
Reliability and Falsity The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme.
With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge.
Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government.
As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has concluded that a successful False Claims Act (FCA) claim should “allege not just a scheme, but a scheme that actually led to false claims being submitted to the government”—and must do so with particularity.

This heightened pleading standard cost the qui tam relators in United States ex rel. Vargas v. Lincare, Inc. et al., 24-11080, 2025 WL 1122196 (11th Cir. Apr. 16, 2025), three out of the four claims in their fourth amended complaint. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida had dismissed the entire complaint for failing to plead sufficient facts under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) (“Rule 9(b)”).

The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss. The complaint alleged that the defendants, a medical supplier and its subsidiary, improperly coded the accessories (i.e., batteries, chargers, and cables) of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines as ventilator accessories. Ventilator accessories are covered by TRICARE, a health insurance program for military personnel and their families; CPAP accessories are not.

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of claims alleging: (1) the routine waiver of patient copays in violation of TRICARE conditions of participation; (2) automatic shipments of CPAP supplies, such as masks (TRICARE covers these supplies only upon a request); and (3) illegal kickbacks to employees of labs or medical offices who could choose which supplier was used.

“The most direct way to satisfy [Rule 9(b)] is by identifying specific claims submitted to the government: invoices, billing records, reimbursement forms,” wrote Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat. Alternative means (other than documentary proof) may satisfy Rule 9(b), the court noted, as long as the claim has “sufficient indicia of reliability”—a case-by-case determination.

Reliability and Falsity

The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme. The court rejected the defendants’ arguments that: (1) there were insufficient indicia of reliability to show that an actual claim was submitted, and (2) even if claims were submitted, they were not false. On these points, the court determined the following:

Reliability: The relators adequately alleged hands-on access to private records, including patient files, billing correspondence, and authorizations for payment—“the type of inside information that [is] sufficient at the pleading stage.” The relators identified specific claims (i.e., specific instances of upcoding), with dates, amounts, and billing codes.

Falsity: The relators adequately alleged that the coding practices were improper and the resulting claims were false. Though the defendants claimed that TRICARE allowed the substitute ventilator codes, this was a factual dispute and not grounds for dismissal, per the court.

Meanwhile, the relators identified no specific false claims submitted to TRICARE in connection with: (1) any co-pay waiver, (2) the auto-ship scheme involving CPAP replacement supplies, or (3) the alleged kickbacks.

No Shotgun Pleadings

In a separate concurrence, Judge Tjoflat called attention to a “foundational pleading defect that the District Court did not reach.” The relators’ fourth amended complaint, he noted, packed all four of the fraud claims described above into a single count—burdening the courts, defendants, and the appellate process.

“That is not how litigation works,” he wrote. “The fourth amended complaint is a shotgun pleading—something we have condemned time and time again. It…forces courts to play detective rather than umpire.”

Shotgun pleadings, the judge stated, run counter to Rule 8 (requiring statements in a claim to be “short and plain,” with allegations that are “simple, concise, and direct”) and Rule 10 (requiring each claim founding on a separate transaction or occurrence to be stated in a separate count, “if doing so would promote clarity”). When confronted with a shotgun complaint, he said, a defendant should move for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). And a district court should sua sponte strike it—“early and firmly.”

Takeaways

The Vargas decision offers clarity in the Eleventh Circuit on the rigorous application of the Rule 9(b) “reliable indicia” standard in the FCA context. With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge. Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government. Failure to do so is likely to result in dismissal. As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

Why This Matters for Military Members

Let’s be honest—military life is demanding. The stress, the deployments, the constant readiness… it’s a lot. And for many service members, alcohol becomes a coping mechanism. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 1 in 3 active-duty personnel engages in binge drinking, and heavy alcohol use is even more common in the military than in the general population. It’s a serious issue that can lead to physical health problems, strained relationships, and even career setbacks.

What You Can Expect at Ona Treatment Center

Outpatient programs if you want to stay at home while getting treatment

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with options like naltrexone to reduce cravings

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and counseling to help change the way you think about drinking

Family therapy and support programs to bring your loved ones into your recovery process

Dual diagnosis treatment if you’re also dealing with mental health challenges like PTSD or anxiety

The team at Ona knows this isn’t just about stopping drinking—it’s about getting your life back, rebuilding your confidence, and learning how to thrive without alcohol. And they’re here to walk with you through it.

Getting Started Is Easier Than You Think

That’s a huge relief, especially when finances are tight or you’re trying to support a family.

A session dedicated to Global Health Engagement (GHE) featured Army Col. (Dr.) Elizabeth Erickson, director of USU’s Center for Global Health Engagement (CGHE). Erickson discussed updated GHE terminology and outlined the strategic importance of both GHE and the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Program (SPP) in fostering collaboration with international allies. She stressed the need to align GHE activities directly with overarching strategic priorities. Col. Charla Geist described the SPP as a vital ""key tool for building enduring relationships."" Examples like the impactful Pacific Partnership mission and the Rush University Advanced Trauma Training Program served as powerful illustrations of effective GHE and successful military-civilian partnerships in action.

The conference also held discussions on women’s health research.

context. (Photo credit: Hadiyah Brendel, USU)

System-Wide Assessment and Future Directions

High-level discussions grappled with the overarching MHS structure, the effectiveness of current training paradigms, and the evolving needs of the future military medical workforce. A key presentation detailed the Section 724 study, a comprehensive USU-led assessment evaluating MHS education and training programs specifically through the lens of operational readiness. Presenters included Dr. Glendon Diehl, USU's vice president for External Affairs, and Mr. Allen Middleton, senior advisor to the USU President. Mandated by Congress, this study aims to create a dynamic digital dashboard enabling data-driven insights and fostering collaborative improvement across the MHS. ""If you don’t train the force the right way, you won’t be able to execute the mission,” Middleton stated pointedly. Diehl elaborated, ""If you're not filling to the requirement, then you should understand what your risk and your gap is.""

USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson emphasized the necessity of adapting the MHS workforce to a landscape constantly being reshaped by demographic shifts, rapid technological advancements, and emerging models of care, stressing the unique readiness requirements inherent to the military context. Dr. Jeffrey Freeman, director of USU's National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health (NCDMPH), guided a discussion on Medical Operations Coordination Centers (MOCCs), exploring ways to enhance national preparedness for health crises. Freeman observed, ""We cannot afford to have a bunch of people standing around…and our healthcare systems are exactly the same."" Dr. Petrice Longenecker, USU's human protections director, offered crucial guidance on navigating the complex web of MHS research regulations, while another USU-led session featuring Dr. Christine Bader addressed emerging medical ethical challenges posed by modern warfare.

Collectively, these diverse sessions provided a vital platform for leaders and experts to collaboratively dissect the challenges and seize the opportunities facing military medicine today. Across the board, conversations consistently converged on enhancing readiness, driving meaningful innovation, developing the next generation of leaders, and ensuring the MHS remains prepared and resilient to meet evolving global and domestic health demands.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHJuT0fTHzhk-95E5AXz2W-G3vWemd9hA0X88MEKrpnQnfeBjFFH9yDWiJgf3a-xrg9qBZNBPfVqdsOCwFPuqKcPI72-3SCJwf4VkGsO4a6dGc5G3YV-XvNm-ZJKndLCcko2o8FB_T59It7Zd7c8n9_75MCZPrDS6qzxj3WmSL5JKhespR-WkEkpvQeCA/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/SG%20Panel%203.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-12 16:56:16.006101

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon is halting gender-affirming healthcare for transgender troops as it moves to implement President Donald Trump's plan to kick them out of the U.S. military, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.

""I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,"" Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in the memo.

The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights said that the abrupt termination of healthcare was ""needlessly disrespectful and cruel.""

""It is shameful that our nation's military would treat any service member this way,"" Minter said.

One transgender service member, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted, called the decision ""the latest slap in the face"" to troops serving honorably.

""If there was any doubt left, there is not anymore: transgender service members are no longer entitled to the same standard of medical care as their peers,"" the service member said.

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 6 permitted Trump's administration to implement his ban on transgender people in the military, allowing the armed forces to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out.

Reuters first reported last week a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6.

There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates.

Trump signed an executive order in January, after returning to the presidency, that reversed a policy implemented under his predecessor Joe Biden that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly.

A Gallup poll published in February found that 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals to serve in the military, but the support had declined from 71% in 2019.

A former Fox News host, Hegseth has embraced conservative stances on culture war issues, including eliminating diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.

Re-posting an article that said the Pentagon would resume treatments for transgender troops, Hegseth said: ""If this is true - we will find any way possible to stop it.""

The ceremony, led by Lieutenant (junior grade) Beth Hillman, highlighted a culture of excellence that defines the Military Health System and celebrated the vital contributions of its nurses and corpsmen.

The DAISY Award—an acronym for Diseases Attacking the Immune System—was created by the family of Patrick Barnes, who passed away in 1999 from complications of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), an autoimmune disease. What began as a heartfelt “thank you” to nurses who brought compassion and comfort during a time of grief has grown into a global movement that honors extraordinary clinical skill and empathetic care.

“We are honored to be here to recognize the invaluable contribution of our nurses and corpsmen to our Military Health System,” said Lt. j.g. Hillman during the ceremony. “Their compassion and excellence elevate the standard of care and embody the mission of the DAISY Foundation.”

As part of this year’s ceremony, USNH Sigonella proudly announced the nominees and honorees for the 2025 DAISY Awards. These individuals exemplify the hospital’s commitment to high-quality, safe, and patient-centered care:

2025 DAISY Award Honorees:

Extraordinary Nurse Award: Registered Nurse Elizabeth Broomfield-Smith

Extraordinary Nurse Leader Award: Commander James Estoesta

Corpsman Nominees:

Hospital Corpsman Second Class Jose Perez Gonzalez

Hospital Corpsman Second Class Mark Wear

Lieutenant Kelly Love

Lieutenant Sherri Simpson

Lieutenant (junior grade) Emma Bartlett

Registered Nurse Jennifer Maganis

Lieutenant Commander Molly Fowler

Nurse Leader Nominees:

Registered Nurse Elizabeth Broomfield-Smith

Registered Nurse Jennifer Maganis

These professionals are more than just caregivers—they are leaders, mentors, and symbols of the enduring values that uphold military medicine. Their recognition reinforces USNH Sigonella’s commitment to fostering a culture of excellence, where every act of care contributes to force readiness and global mission success.

As one of the Defense Health Agency’s Overseas Military Treatment Facilities, USNH Sigonella supports U.S. Fifth and Sixth Fleet operations, ensuring that both active duty service members and their families receive exceptional care. The ceremony underscored that in every patient interaction, these medical professionals embody the best of Navy Medicine.

Sgt. Loura Javier, surgical technician, 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage, Alaska, is leading a groundbreaking training partnership between JBER and Alaska Native Medical Center, a 182-bed, level 2 trauma hospital in Anchorage, Alaska.

Javier designed and launched a rotational training program that places one Defense Health Agency surgical technologist at a time into ANMC’s 11-suite operating room department for a month-long immersive experience.

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts.

“This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees.

“Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

Javier’s forward-thinking approach is setting a new standard for training innovation within military medicine. Her efforts are not only advancing individual proficiency but also ensuring that JBER’s surgical technologists are better prepared for any operational challenge.

“Her leadership has created a model for future partnerships,” said Col. Laura Baugh, commander 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier embodies the spirit of excellence, and her work will have a lasting impact on the future of military medical training.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9030512/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-12 15:56:50.623481

SPRING HILL, Tenn., May 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Family Care Center, a leading provider of outpatient behavioral health services, proudly announces the opening of its newest clinic in Spring Hill, Tennessee. This expansion marks the organization's ninth location in the state and reinforces its commitment to addressing the urgent and growing demand for accessible, high-quality mental health care.

Family Care Center's newest clinic is designed to help close that gap by offering timely, comprehensive treatment options for a wide range of mental health concerns.

""Opening this clinic in Spring Hill is a vital step in ensuring that individuals facing anxiety, depression, or other challenges can access the personalized, life-changing care they deserve,"" said Dr. Chris Ivany, CEO of Family Care Center. ""Our approach combines compassionate support with clinically proven treatments, helping individuals navigate their mental health journey with confidence.""

Family Care Center provides a variety of evidence-based treatments for patients of all ages, including individual and family therapy, psychiatric care, medication management, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)—an FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment for depression, OCD, and other conditions that haven't responded to traditional therapies.

""Our goal is to create a safe, supportive space where individuals can access the tools and care they need to achieve lasting wellness,"" said David Wood, Regional Director for Family Care Center in Tennessee. ""Patients can see their therapist, psychologist, and other providers in one convenient location, with appointments available in days, not months.""

This patient-centered, integrated model isn't just more convenient—it works. Family Care Center consistently delivers outcomes that exceed national benchmarks.

85.5% of patients treated for depression report significant symptom reduction within six months

86.1% of patients treated for anxiety experience similar improvement
