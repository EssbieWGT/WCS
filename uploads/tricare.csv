During fiscal years 2023 and 2024, union staffers at the Defense Health Agency (DHA) — which oversees the TRICARE health benefits for US troops — charged the federal government for the time they spent working on contract negotiations, eking out fringe benefits and other union duties, according to a report obtained by Sen. Joni Ernst’s (R-Iowa) office.

Of the $3.3 million spent on “union time,” about $190,000 was spent on negotiating a labor contract for workers at the agency since April 2023.

“During this period our agency was undergoing a significant transition aimed at stabilizing and enhancing our labor relations process,” DHA said when asked about the large expense.

At the time, only about 36% of seats at the agency’s headquarters were occupied, according to the findings.

DHA’s multimillion expenses on taxpayer-funded union time is the largest figure that Ernst’s office has released during its investigation of the use of taxpayer resources on union-related expenses across federal agencies.

Ernst, an Army veteran and leader of the Senate DOGE caucus, has been probing federal agency use of taxpayer-funded union time and previously championed legislation requiring federal workers to reimburse the government for time and resources spent on union activities.

“This report on the Defense Health Agency highlights everything that’s wrong with the federal workforce,” Ernst told The Post.

“Taxpayers were subsidizing more than $3 million of union activities while the D.C. headquarters sat at just 36% occupancy. Bureaucrats should serve the American people, not themselves.”

Other agencies had significantly lower spending on taxpayer-funded union time. NASA spent about $400,000 last year, while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission spent about $420,000 on it in 2024.

Federal unions are restricted from negotiating benefits and pay by the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute. Instead, benefits and pay are determined by law set by Congress and federal regulations.

But federal unions can negotiate over more minor aspects of working conditions.

“This includes things like the height of cubicle panels, securing designated smoking areas on otherwise smoke-free campuses, and the right to wear Spandex at work,” Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow on workforce and public finance at the Heritage Foundation, previously told The Post.

Back in 2019, the Office of Personnel Management released comprehensive data on taxpayer-funded union time and concluded that the entire federal government had spent at least $135 million on it that year.

After 2019, OPM stopped tracking that data.

Back in February, Ernst requested data from 24 federal agencies. The Trump administration has since directed federal agencies to furnish that information.

The Post reached out to both DHA and its union for comment.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-aemf359gf-1743784728775.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1743770372&w=1024,N,0.0,2025-04-06 16:56:16.982884

Maj. Troy E. Black, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a room full of Defense Health Agency staff while pointing to the American flag.

In a town hall meeting, Black told staff at the Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, the military operates at a “strategic level now, talking about what happens when nation states go to war, and how do we understand the scope and the scale of that? “History is 100% accurate, no matter how we want to read it,” Black added. “There will be another conflict or war. They will go to scale.”

Black said the U.S. military needs to be ready for large-scale conflict like America hasn’t seen since World War II, including to ensure its medical system–military and civilian–is prepared for large and continuous waves of wounded.

He said DHA must proactively align its efforts with the changing character of warfare and the military's needs, rather than waiting for direction. He also noted the importance of close collaboration with the services and combatant commands to understand their evolving requirements and ensure DHA is prepared to provide necessary combat support.

Black emphasized the importance of standardizing medical treatment and casualty care across the services to ensure common standards of care, and the need to assess capabilities and resources to support high-casualty scenarios.

Underscoring the need to collaborate across the services, Black said, “All service branches do it differently. All have different equipment. All have different links of training to meet the same requirement or additional requirements. All do different platforms in a different uniform all the different ways,” adding, “We have to be focused on how we save a human being at the point of injury under fire by an adversary.”

First and foremost, Black stressed, is the need for service members to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice. He reiterated the need to come together to support the warfighter, as “you're dealing with the one thing: preservation of life.”

Black concluded by reminding everyone, “It’s not all bad news! Remember this: We win.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8952221.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-05 13:56:29.325561

— Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services

PENSACOLA , FL, UNITED STATES, April 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and Prizm Medical Inc., a leading provider of electrotherapy devices, announced today that they have partnered to serve federal healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Lovell Government Services will serve as Prizm Medical Inc.’s Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor to serve these customers through federal contracting systems.

About the Products

• Micro-Z™ Mini and Micro-Z™ II DC Stimulators are the world’s first and only wearable medical devices that offers below-sensory nocturnal HVPG stimulation while you sleep for rapid recovery and unlimited drug-free pain relief – all with the convenience of a portable delivery system for in-home treatments. Micro-Z™ Mini includes a built-in EMR for increased patient compliance.

• Intelligent Textiles®, the world’s first garment electrodes are conductive garments that provide an unparalleled delivery system for uniform stimulation treatments across large areas of the body. These include Silver-Thera™ socks, stockings, leggings, gloves, sleeves, braces, wraps, and more.

• Thera-Cream™ Electrotherapy Skin Prep is a highly conductive cream that increases skin conductivity for superior electrotherapy treatments with Intelligent Textiles®. This popular item is being used in some hospitals as a replacement for ultrasound gels because it is not sticky, it absorbs into the skin with no messy cleanup, it has an aroma that is enjoyed by men and women, and it therapeutically heals dry, cracked skin.

FDA Indications

• Pain Relief

• Increases Microcirculation

• Increase Range of Motion

• Retard Disuse Atrophy

Medicare Approved for:

• Acute Post-Op Pain Relief

• Chronic Pain Relief

• Retard Disuse Atrophy (Reimbursed by most private insurance)

Evidence Based Medicine

• 50 years of clinical research with 109 studies on HVPG

• 4 published research on The Silver-Thera Stocking

• Medicare approved procedure codes for wound healing

• U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend for wound healing

As Prizm Medical Inc.’s SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. Prizm Medical Inc. is available on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency’s Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). Listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

""We’re excited to partner with Prizm Medical Inc., a leader in electrotherapy innovation. Their Micro-Z™ DC stimulator, already benefiting over 300,000 patients worldwide, offers a unique, effective solution for healing and pain relief. This collaboration will bring accessible, advanced treatment options to those in need.” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

“Pain is a messenger. You can shoot the messenger with a drug, or you can respond to the message by promoting healing at the source of the pain. Since the human body operates on DC signaling, Micro-Z™ technology stimulates healing at the source of the pain instead of masking it like traditional TENS electrotherapy. To compare the two, TENS therapy delivers a low frequency AC current in Milliamps, resulting in shallow, temporary pain relief, and only while being worn. Micro-Z™ technology delivers a high volt pulsed DC current in Microamps, resulting in deep tissue microcirculation at the cellular level, promoting healing and pain relief at the point of origin. The consistent results from hospitals using Micro-Z™ technology are improved medical outcomes, reduction in costs, and increased revenues.” - James Johnson | Founder & CEO, Prizm Medical Inc.

Key Takeaways

The expansion of Amwell's platform in the Military Health System is expected to boost subscription revenue and enhance margins significantly.

Divesting Amwell Psychiatric Care strengthens the balance sheet, allowing focus on higher-margin core services and improved net margins.

Flat revenue growth, declining visit volumes, and client attrition highlight challenges in sustaining revenue; reliance on military contracts and cost cuts may risk future growth.

Catalysts

About American Well

An enterprise platform and software company, delivers digitally enabling hybrid care in the United States and internationally.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

The staged launch and expansion of Amwell's platform across the Military Health System, their most significant growth initiative, is expected to significantly increase subscription revenue, with the full deployment anticipated to be completed this year. This will likely lead to increased revenues and margins as well as a higher quality revenue mix due to the size and strategic importance of such contracts.

Amwell aims to achieve positive cash flow by 2026 through increasing subscription software revenues and aligning costs, expecting a meaningful margin expansion with an over 60% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the coming year, impacting their net margins and earnings positively.

The divestiture of Amwell Psychiatric Care, which was not integral to the company's core offering, has bolstered Amwell's balance sheet by adding $30 million in cash and allowed them to focus on higher margin core subscription services, likely leading to improved net margins and operating income.

Amwell is focused on expanding its existing contracts and signing new ones, notably in the government sector, with significant opportunities in the pipeline. Successful execution could considerably enhance their revenue growth and subscription revenue mix.

Increasing the mix of recurring subscription revenue, partly through strategic partnerships like the one with Vida Health, is expected to not only drive revenue growth but also improve earnings visibility, predictability, and profitability by enhancing the quality of revenue and expanding profit margins.

American Well Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

Analysts are assuming American Well's revenue will grow by 6.0% annually over the next 3 years.

Analysts are not forecasting that American Well will become profitable in next 3 years. To represent the Analyst Price Target as a Future PE Valuation we will estimate American Well's profit margin will increase from -81.8% to the average US Healthcare Services industry of 12.2% in 3 years.

If American Well's profit margin were to converge on the industry average, you could expect earnings to reach $36.8 million (and earnings per share of $2.05) by about April 2028, up from $-208.1 million today.

In order for the above numbers to justify the analysts price target, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 7.1x on those 2028 earnings, up from -0.5x today. This future PE is lower than the current PE for the US Healthcare Services industry at 50.9x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to grow by 5.31% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 7.59%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

American Well Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

Amwell's revenue growth has been stagnant, with Q4 2024 revenue flat compared to the previous year, indicating challenges in driving top-line growth which could impact future earnings.

A significant decline of 18% in visit volumes compared to the previous year suggests potential challenges in maintaining customer engagement and sustaining revenue streams from visit-based services.

The company experienced material attrition among its major clients in 2024, affecting the stability of its revenue base and posing a risk to future revenue continuity.

The dependency on a successful renewal and execution of the Military Health System contract exposes the company to significant risk if there are delays or changes to government funding, which could impact projected revenues.

Cost reduction initiatives, while improving EBITDA, could lead to underinvestment in areas critical for growth and innovation, potentially impacting long-term revenue growth prospects and margins.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The analysts have a consensus price target of $11.643 for American Well based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $15.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $10.0.

In order for you to agree with the analyst's consensus, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $303.2 million, earnings will come to $36.8 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 7.1x, assuming you use a discount rate of 7.6%.

Given the current share price of $6.81, the analyst price target of $11.64 is 41.5% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“It's a great honor to be named as DHA R&D-MRDC Employee of the Year,” says Thakur.
ORA contributes to DHA R&D-MRDC’s multifaceted effort to integrate medical research and development with Warfighter requirements in a unique way.
Its multidisciplinary team of regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals specialize in guiding regulated medical products through the FDA’s rigorous review process.
“He is a tremendous asset to the ORA team.” Thakur joined ORA in 2013 as a contractor and transitioned to civilian status in 2017.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics Branch at the Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command’s Office of Regulated Activities, received the 2024 Employee of the Year award for his exemplary regulatory support for the command’s advanced development programs that contribute to Warfighter survivability, force health protection, and readiness.

In announcing the award, DHA R&D-MRDC Director Maj. Gen. Paula Lodi noted that thanks in large part to his leadership, five medical products attained marketing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year – believed to be a record number for the organization.

Each of the products meets an urgent military medical requirement to provide Warfighters with cutting-edge solutions that ensure greater resilience, adaptability, and lethality. Thakur’s efforts to field these products, therefore, directly contribute to DHA R&D-MRDC’s success in improving combat casualty care and enhancing human performance.

“It's a great honor to be named as DHA R&D-MRDC Employee of the Year,” says Thakur. “It elevates my confidence level and my motivation to continue striving for the levels of performance that we accomplished last year and continue even further.”

Thakur praised the members of the two teams he leads for their scientific and regulatory affairs management excellence in seeing the five products through the regulatory process to completion last year, along with shepherding many other projects that are currently progressing through the regulatory review process.

Four of the products – the i-STAT Traumatic Brain Injury Whole Blood test, the MEQU Portable Blood and IV Fluid Warmer System, the Automated Processing of the Physiological Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity Hemorrhage Risk Index, and the Infrascanner Model 2500 – received FDA clearances, allowing the devices to be marketed in the United States. The fifth product, the Humacyte acellular tissue engineered vessel, received biologics license application approval from the FDA. These milestones represent the culmination of more than 15 years of development activities and ORA regulatory support to the project management offices for those products.

ORA contributes to DHA R&D-MRDC’s multifaceted effort to integrate medical research and development with Warfighter requirements in a unique way. Its multidisciplinary team of regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals specialize in guiding regulated medical products through the FDA’s rigorous review process. By identifying and mitigating risks early in the development life cycle, ORA accelerates the delivery of lifesaving drugs, biologics, medical devices, and combination products to the Warfighter. ORA provides its services to partners across DOD. Thakur’s Medical Devices and Diagnostics branch, one of three regulatory branches in ORA, focuses on expeditionary medicine and treatment, brain health protection, and acute care.

“Chandar has been the solid source of regulatory intelligence who makes sure we're getting the most up-to-date understanding of the FDA's thinking and guidance for specific products,” says Lt. Col. Stuart Hobbs, ORA’s deputy director. “He provides constant and steady guidance to ensure his teams get through the development pathway in the shortest and most cost-effective way. It's great to see that steady effort recognized.”

Lisa Borek, ORA’s director and senior regulatory and clinical services manager, who has worked with Thakur since 2015, says the award is a recognition of his strong and unwavering dedication to helping DHA R&D-MRDC develop life-saving treatments, trauma care solutions, and medical devices that harness cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and human performance optimization.

“When presented with a regulatory obstacle, Chandar views it as a workable challenge,” says Borek. “He has built solid relationships with our FDA partners that serve us well when we need answers to keep a development moving along the regulatory pathway to approval.”

“He cares deeply about the DHA mission and is focused on getting products through the FDA and available to our Service Members,” adds Borek. “He is a tremendous asset to the ORA team.”

Thakur joined ORA in 2013 as a contractor and transitioned to civilian status in 2017. In that time, he’s seen many advances in military medical technologies, but the fundamentals have remained the same; the key, he says, is to stay on top of the latest developments wherever they happen.

“The regulatory environment is always dynamic, always changing,” says Thakur. “It's important to keep up with the current thinking from the FDA. It’s rewarding to support all these product development efforts across MRDC to get them to their finish line, and to put safe and effective medical products into the hands of our Warfighters.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8954266/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-04 14:56:20.583970

Early in the year, complaints about the vendor that administers the western region contract for TRICARE, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, surfaced across several segments of public discourse. At the time, Autism Business News found that nearly every system providers needed to use for administrative work with TriWest was nonfunctional.

At nearly the same time, providers who engaged with the eastern TRICARE contractor, Humana Military, began to disclose similar problems.

For months at a time, technology systems did not work as promised, and payments were not made, driving an existential crisis for the providers that often either go out of their way to serve active military members and their families or are based in communities around military bases and installations.

This has left several autism therapy providers — although the problems with TriWest Healthcare Alliance and Humana Military were not limited to autism therapy providers — feeling helpless, frustrated and worried about their organization’s survival and access to care for military families. Autism Business News has spoken to several autism therapy and related providers on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from sharing their experiences.

“It was clear when it went live — and we heard this from all the other groups we know — nothing was ready to go on Jan. 1,” said the clinical director of one Tennessee-based practice.

Fortunately, by mid-March, many of the most critical issues had been resolved by Humana Military and its subcontracted claims processor PGBA, according to several sources. One source posited the situation was about “85% resolved” during an interview.

Providers in several states have told ABN that payments for claims are coming through. Claims processes appear to be working; authorizations are being accepted and assessed. Others say that claims are being paid and processed within a typical 30-day timetable but are not going at an even cadence. Others still complain that the self-service tools are not correctly displaying provider information or allowing providers to track their claims and payments.

Still, in stark contrast to reporting done earlier in the year on the TriWest Healthcare Alliance process, several providers have said that PGBA and Humana Military are communicating with providers to some degree and making demonstrable progress. What’s more, the federal apparatus over TRICARE has taken greater notice as the contract transition crisis has carried on. TRICARE is part of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), a division of the U.S. Department of Defense.

“I received a call last week from a DHA rep working with Humana Military apologizing for the entire fiasco,” one provider in Virginia said. “Overall, things appear to be normalizing, but there are still some unresolved issues.”

Multiple representatives of Humana Military did not respond to requests for comment.

What happened?

The roots of the TRICARE challenges reach back years and years.

DHA announced it had awarded the “new T-5 contracts” to Humana Military, a part of the Louisville, Kentucky-based managed care organization, Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), and TriCare Healthcare Alliance in December 2022. Humana has engaged with the U.S. Department of Defense since 1996, the company said. In 2011, DOD awarded a contract to Humana to administer the now-defunct TRICARE South region. The TRICARE regions were fused to simply include East and West for the 2016 contract awards; Humana won the contract for the East region in 2016.

Along the way, Humana Military has engaged with various subcontractors to handle the technical aspects of billing and claims processing. One contractor included PGBA, a part of the team of contractors that Humana included in its pitch for the TRICARE contract. PGBA replaced Wisconsin Physicians Service (WPS) as Humana’s claims processor. However, PGBA has been a partner for Humana in its previous TRICARE contract awards. Based on providers’ observations, one key hiccup was that the claim system could not reconcile claims and provider profile data for operators and organizations in the PGBA system before the current contract period.

Additionally, there were hangups in getting digital claims submission and payment processing correct. One subject matter expert told ABN that Humana Military offered payment advances on pending claims. While seen as a good faith effort, this person said, it has led to another point of irritation with providers.

“It’s just that people are really mad because as soon as claims started to process, [Humana] started to reconcile [payments with the advance],” this person said. “They went weeks without getting paid and [Humana] is taking back claim dollars from literally the first things that are going through. So, they’re still not getting paid even though they’re getting processed.”

The situation may distress some autism therapy providers beyond the crisis of the last few months. Organizations across all regions of TRICARE note that care rates, even if a smaller portion of a provider’s revenue, aren’t at the levels that lead to padded balance sheets. Meaning, some organizations may stop working with TRICARE patients or face the likelihood of being forced to shut down.

The biggest concern among providers

All sources consulted for this story worry that the TRICARE contract transition snafu will limit access to services for the program’s members. A near second to that, they worry about the prospect that autism therapy providers may shut altogether, further complicating the access challenges for the industry.

Earlier in the year, some providers in the East region said their business demise was a distinct possibility.

“If I have to give my clients a heads up and tell them I have to shutter, I can’t continue, then they’re going to have to go back to waiting lists, and that can be six months and up to a year just to get another therapist in the door for them,” one provider said in February.

Others also worry that fewer autism therapy providers will lead to limited job prospects in regions with large TRICARE populations. With fewer organizations in those communities, there are fewer job opportunities. And with the cash flow crunch created by the flubbed contract transition, organizations that will weather the storm won’t have the resources to hire staff hitting the market due to closures. That assumes that clinicians will want to come back or come to the TRICARE slice of the autism therapy industry at all.

“So, now we have all these kids — my phone is ringing off the hook and they’re asking, ‘Do you have any openings?’ And I don’t, and I won’t, not because I don’t want to, but also because we’ve been trying to hire,” one provider said. “Who wants to come work within this program right now?”",https://bhbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/04/ryan-quintal-SqrXDNo584Y-unsplash.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-04-04 14:56:26.430667

Among the many professionals dedicated to this mission, Lt. Donte Brackett, the hospital’s dietitian – and U.S. Navy Dietitian of the Year – plays a crucial role in shaping warfighter readiness and ensuring patient safety through education.

“Food science is fascinating, especially in how it varies based on factors like age and health conditions,” Brackett said. “I love educating and empowering people to make informed choices, and I enjoy collaborating with healthcare professionals. The opportunity for community outreach and advocating for better nutrition policies also motivates me. Being a dietitian is a fulfilling way to make a positive impact.”

Dietitians are more than advisors on food choices, they help sustain the health and performance of service members in a demanding operational environment.

“Understanding hydration, sodium, electrolytes, exercise and how to fuel your body based on climate, location and type of work matters,” Brackett said. “Consider the caloric needs for different environments or different jobs. [Masters-at-Arms] may be more active and outdoors, whereas a corpsman may be indoors doing patient intake with less movement. Their dietary needs are different.”

For patients recovering from injuries, illnesses, or surgery, a dietitian’s recommendations can directly impact healing and recovery times, including food-drug interactions and food safety considerations.

Brackett joined the Navy as an undesignated enlisted Sailor and found his calling as a hospital corpsman. He became a surgical technician, serving in that rate for 10 years. A conversation with a surgeon changed his trajectory.

“I liked medicine, I loved healthcare and helping people, but I didn’t want to be a nurse or a doctor,” Brackett said. “The surgeon mentioned that a lot of the surgeries he performed could have been prevented with diet intervention – that got my attention.”

That conversation sent Brackett “down the rabbit hole” of researching dietetics and speaking with military dieticians.

“I wanted to become a dietitian because of my passion for nutrition and its significant impact on health. Witnessing how dietary choices can transform lives inspired me to help others achieve their health goals. I find it very rewarding when I see patients make the connection between nutrition and health,” Brackett said. “I love this job.”

Brackett later commissioned as a naval officer and found his calling as a lifestyle dietitian. He now sees a wide variety of patients, helping them make sustainable dietary and lifestyle changes to improve their overall health and well-being using a holistic approach.

“GTMO is unique, I’m the only dietitian on the base and I see everyone – active-duty members, dependents, foreign nationals, Special Category Residents – every case from pregnancy to geriatrics – you just need a referral,” Brackett said. “If you just want some nutrition information, I can help. Whether it’s weight loss, food allergies, disease management, or caloric increase, dietitians are like Swiss-Army knives, we have a broad range of knowledge about nutrition.”

One of the biggest topics he educates people about is portion control.

“Energy in, energy out. A lot of people go zero to 100 when it comes to weight loss which becomes a rollercoaster of crash dieting,” Brackett said. “I recommend starting small, write down what you eat and your activities for three days, then we analyze it together.”

Brackett also helps patients focus on incremental improvements, like reducing caffeine or sugar consumption. He uses this strategy to help patients analyze and understand why they met – or missed – the goal.

“Food is both a gift and challenge. We use it for celebration, but we also find ourselves reaching for food when we want comfort,” he said. “Mindfulness matters, be in control of your emotions when you eat.”

From high-intensity workouts to extended deployments, service members rely on optimal nutrition to sustain energy and recover quickly. Dehydration, poor diet, or nutrient deficiencies can lead to fatigue, decreased focus, and an increased risk of injury.

“My job is a balance of science, strategy and service. Nutrition isn’t just about food—it’s about fuel. My job is to make sure our warfighters get the right nutrients to stay strong, sharp, and mission ready.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8954022/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-04 13:56:27.397663

Secure portal messages allow patients to connect with their health care teams between clinic visits. Older adults, who often have multiple chronic conditions, may particularly benefit from portal messages, given challenges with accessing care and addressing all health issues comprehensively in a single office visit. In 2020, telemedicine reimbursement expanded, allowing clinicians to bill for portal messages that require clinician time for medical decision-making.1,2 However, copays associated with portal messages may discourage patients, especially individuals with low income, from communicating important health information through the portal. Furthermore, coverage for billed portal messages vary by insurance plan. Our objective was to characterize the prevalence of reported copays for portal messages by health insurance type among US adults aged 50 years or older who used portal messaging.

Methods

From February 22 to March 12, 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey using a probability-based sample of US adults aged 50 years or older (43.7% completion rate [eMethods in Supplement 1]) through the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging and weighted the sample to reflect population figures from the US Census Bureau.3 The University of Michigan institutional review board deemed this study exempt and waived informed consent because the data were deidentified. We followed the AAPOR reporting guideline.

Older adults were asked if they had a patient portal, had messaged a health care professional (the term health care provider was used in our survey) through the portal, and whether they were charged a copay for sending a message. Self-reported sociodemographic information and health insurance information were collected. We used multivariable logistic regression with average marginal effects to estimate associations between having been charged a copay for sending a portal message (primary outcome) and health insurance type (main variable; eMethods in Supplement 1). We used sample weights to account for probability-based sampling design and survey nonresponse. Two-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 18.

Results

Of the 3212 respondents (mean age, 65 [95% CI, 64-66] years; weighted, 53.3% women and weighted, 46.7% men), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.1%) of respondents reported having a patient portal and 64.7% (95% CI, 62.3%-67.2%) reported sending a portal message in the past year (Table). Across health insurance types, most older adults reported having sent a portal message in the past year, ranging from 58.6% (95% CI, 44.3%-72.8%) of those with traditional Medicare without supplemental insurance to 75.2% (95% CI, 67.9%-82.5%) of those with Veterans Affairs coverage (Figure). A lower proportion of older adults (13.1% [95% CI, 11.4%-15.0%]) reported being a charged a copay for sending a portal message (Table), with the highest estimate being 16.6% (95% CI, 11.2%-21.9%) for those privately insured, followed by 15.9% (95% CI, 4.5%-27.4%) for those dual-eligible or with Medicaid (Figure).

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of adults aged 50 years or older, most individuals reported sending a portal message to their health care professional in the past year, with a minority reporting ever having a copay for such messages. The low prevalence of copays in our study is consistent with prior studies showing full coverage of portal message out-of-pocket costs among privately insured patients over 80% of the time, with estimates ranging from $14 to $40 per message when not covered.4 We found that Medicaid-eligible individuals had similar estimated prevalences of reported copays compared with privately insured individuals. Although we lack data on self-reported out-of-pocket costs, our findings highlight a potential gap where Medicaid-eligible individuals may not experience the same degree of cost-sharing reduction they typically receive for many other clinical services.5 Limitations include inability to identify nonbillable messages and data being self-reported and subject to possible recall bias, which may underestimate the true prevalence of charged copays.6 Future research should explore how variation in portal message copays across payers, particularly Medicaid, impact health care utilization among individuals with low income.

What You Need to Know: CMA and AMA have filed a joint brief in defense of California’s long-standing Truth in Advertising law that prohibits the use of the title “doctor” in a health care setting by anyone other than licensed physicians.

The California Medical Association (CMA) and the American Medical Association (AMA) have filed a joint amicus curiae brief in Palmer v. Bonta defending California’s long-standing Truth in Advertising law that prohibits the use of the title “doctor” or the prefix “Dr.” in a health care setting by anyone other than California-licensed allopathic (M.D.) or osteopathic (D.O.) physicians.

This case arises from a lawsuit by three nurse practitioners holding “Doctorate of Nursing” degrees who want to refer to themselves as “doctors” when treating patients. Their lawsuit seeks to invalidate California Business and Professions Code section 2054, arguing that the statute violates their First Amendment speech rights. The nurses claim they are not misleading patients because they use “doctor” and the title “Dr.” in conjunction with their nursing degrees. They admit such usage is not permitted under the law in patient-facing settings. Last month, both sides in the case filed motions for summary judgement. (A petition or motion for summary judgment is a request for the judge to decide a case without a full trial, arguing that there are no genuine disputes of material fact.)

CMA and AMA filed a joint brief, in support of the state’s motion for summary judgment, emphasizing that courts have repeatedly found a legitimate government interest in preventing misleading advertising or misrepresentation in health care settings. California’s 88-year-old statutory rule designed to protect Californians who interface with the health care delivery system helps ensure that patients are not misled into thinking a practitioner is a licensed physician when they are not.

Physicians are educated and trained differently and more deeply and robustly than any other professional health care practitioner; and industry practice and the law continue to place physicians at the center of medical care.

“The rigorous requirements for physician education and training aim to not just create practitioners to handle routine issues, but leaders in modern health care who are able to coordinate health care teams and solve complex medical issues, identify critical diagnoses, and render timely treatment decisions,” the brief said.

A misrepresentation of a practitioner’s level of licensing can jeopardize patient safety as a patient may mistakenly believe that the midlevel practitioner possesses the same level of training and qualification as physicians licensed by a California medical board.

Patients have a right to clear, honest information about who is providing their care. Yet in today’s health care settings, it’s becoming harder for patients to distinguish between who is — and who isn’t — a physician.

The Truth in Advertising laws exist to protect patients, helping ensure they aren’t mistakenly led to believe they’re being treated by a physician when they’re not. To safeguard patient trust and promote informed decision-making, it’s essential we uphold these laws and continue prioritizing transparency in health care.
