A state court can issue a divorce decree that appears equitable on paper and still produce outcomes that DFAS or the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot legally implement. When both spouses are veterans, these risks compound, creating a fragmented process with no single agency responsible for coordinating outcomes.

Military Retired Pay and the Limits of State Court Authority

Military retired pay is divisible in divorce only because Congress permits it under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act, codified at 10 U.S.C. § 1408. The statute allows state courts to treat “disposable retired pay” as marital property, but only as federally defined. DFAS enforces these limits strictly and will not honor orders that exceed statutory authority or fail to meet technical requirements, regardless of a judge’s intent. DFAS guidance makes clear that it pays only what federal law authorizes and only when the former spouse submits a compliant order and application.

In dual-vet divorces, there are often two retired pay streams. This results in two DFAS enforcement processes and two chances for error. DFAS also caps direct payments to former spouses at 50% of a servicemember’s disposable retired pay under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act. This cap applies regardless of what a state court orders and regardless of how many obligations the court attempts to satisfy through retirement pay. As a result, when courts try to use retirement pay to cover multiple property awards or financial obligations, DFAS will still enforce only up to the statutory limit, leaving the remainder unenforceable through DFAS and shifting collection back to the parties themselves.

VA Disability Compensation and Federal Preemption

VA disability compensation adds another layer of instability. To receive VA disability pay, a retiree generally must waive a corresponding portion of military retired pay. That waiver reduces the amount of divisible retired pay available to a former spouse. The Supreme Court held in Mansell v. Mansell that states may not divide the portion of retired pay waived to receive VA disability compensation.

In Howell v. Howell, the Supreme Court held that state courts may not remedy that reduction by ordering the veteran to reimburse or indemnify the former spouse for the lost amount. Even if the divorce assumed a stable pension or the disability rating occurs years later, federal law preempts state courts from restoring the former spouse’s share through offset or repayment orders.

Concurrent Receipt and Special Compensation

Some retirees qualify for Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay, which allows receipt of both retired pay and VA disability compensation under 10 U.S.C. § 1414. Others receive Combat-Related Special Compensation under 10 U.S.C. § 1413a. These programs affect how money is characterized and paid, which matters because DFAS treats retired pay and special compensation differently for division and enforcement. Dual-vet couples face this classification problem twice, increasing the risk that income streams assumed to be divisible turn out not to be.

Survivor Benefit Plan Deadlines that Quietly Erase Rights

The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) is one of the most commonly mishandled aspects of military divorce. If a divorce decree requires former-spouse SBP coverage, the former spouse must submit a deemed election request to DFAS within one year of the court order. Missing that deadline can permanently eliminate SBP coverage, even if the decree clearly awarded it. Guidance emphasizes that SBP elections are deadline-driven and unforgiving.

Dual-vet divorces often involve two SBP decisions, doubling the administrative risk. A party can “win” SBP in court and still lose it entirely through a missed filing.

TRICARE Eligibility After Divorce

Health care assumptions frequently break down after dual-vet divorces. TRICARE eligibility for former spouses depends on statutory criteria such as the 20/20/20 and 20/20/15 rules, which turn on years of marriage overlapping creditable service. Eligibility does not automatically continue simply because both spouses served. TRICARE guidance and Title 10make clear that eligibility is status-based and time-dependent.

Spousal Support and VA Apportionment Confusion

VA disability compensation cannot be divided as marital property, but VA regulations allow limited apportionment to spouses or dependents in certain circumstances. These rules are administrative, not judicial, and VA evaluates them independently of state divorce orders. In dual-vet divorces, parties often misunderstand whether apportionment applies after divorce or assume it functions like pension division, which it does not.

Why There Is No Unified Support System

The difficulty is structural. DFAS processes division and direct payment of military retired pay only through the USFSPA framework and its application requirements, not simply because a divorce decree says so. VA disability compensation is governed under Title 38 as an administrative benefits program, separate from DFAS retired pay rules. TRICARE eligibility after divorce follows its own criteria and requires separate administrative steps through DEERS/DMDC. As a result, there is no single standardized “divorce process” across DoD and VA; dual-vet divorces require multiple agency-specific actions, each with its own deadlines and constraints.

Making the Minefield Survivable

Dual-vet divorce becomes manageable only when benefits are treated as a federal compliance problem, not just a family-law dispute. Decrees must track USFSPA requirements precisely, anticipate disability-related changes that federal law will not allow courts to fix later, and treat SBP and TRICARE deadlines as operational mandates. Federal law sets the boundaries, and ignoring those boundaries is what produces the most damaging surprises.

“We’re not going to be like everybody else, because everybody else doesn’t necessarily meet the mark for what military families deserve.","A sergeant major in the Marine Reserve is using decades of experience in and out of uniform to improve health care for service members, retirees, veterans and their families.

As the senior enlisted leader of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron (HMLA) 773, Sgt. Maj. Ted Painter has spent years guiding fellow Marines through the challenges of balancing military service, civilian careers and family life. One case, recently resolved after years, stands out. Painter supported a SNCO on his staff who struggled to secure specialized health care for his children with special needs after transferring to the unit.

“It took them a good six years to get stable,” Painter said. “They even went out of pocket for respite care, even though they were eligible for coverage. His wife, from an employment perspective, struggled because she had to take care of the kids who weren’t getting the care they needed.”

With 23 years of service – 10 of them on active duty – a spouse, and five children of his own, Painter understood the pressure, compounded with the demands of the Marine Corps, this family was under. The sergeant major worked behind the scenes so the SNCO could extend his assignment, ensuring he wouldn’t receive new orders while still trying to stabilize his family’s care plan.

In his civilian role, Painter is the associate vice president of market operations for CareSource Military & Veterans™ (CSMV). From that vantage point, he said he knew even more could’ve been done to assist this family, who are enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP), with specialized health coordination.

“That’s always been a challenge, because the Marine Corps wants to move them, but they’ve got this situation at home that a move could be catastrophic,” Painter said. “We had to work through quite a bit, but an organization like CareSource could’ve come in for a situation like that, and sort of taken over from a care coordination perspective that the family is just not going to get from traditional TRICARE.”

CSMV recently announced its partnership with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), giving eligible TRICARE beneficiaries the option to select CSMV as their health plan during TRICARE’s 2025 Open Season (Nov. 10– Dec. 9). The TRICARE Prime® Demo by CSMV aims to maintain the comprehensive coverage TRICARE beneficiaries expect, while introducing some new features.

Holly Joers, CSMV market president, said the partnership with DHA is built on a shared commitment “to serve those who serve and to deliver high-quality care that meets families where they are.” The plan features referral-free access to in-network specialists, a single point of contact to assist with connecting beneficiaries to the right providers, and medical record transfers for seamless continuity of care.

“Military families deserve choices that reflect their lives,” Joers said. “That means support that is personal, communication that is clear and care that feels connected.”

CSMV is the military-focused division of CareSource, a nonprofit managed care organization. There is no additional cost to choose the TRICARE Prime® Demo by CSMV; standard costs apply based on a beneficiary’s respective coverage group. Nearly 150,000 TRICARE beneficiaries live in the pilot areas – Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, where the demo is set to launch. The pilot will test how the CareSource model performs in a community with military treatment facilities (Tampa), and one without (Atlanta). After the trial, DHA has the final say on whether to expand the program in other locations.

“CareSource Military & Veterans brings a community-first approach to military health care,” Joers said. “We understand that access is more than appointments. We combine our national expertise with deep local partnerships to make it easy for families to connect to trusted providers and support.”

After nearly a decade at CareSource, Painter said he’s excited to launch a program that allows him to stay connected and focused on the needs of the community he serves. He added that having a team made up of veterans, military spouses, and others who speak the language and whose shared experiences can inform the program, is critical to its success.

“This has to be authentic,” Painter said. “We’re not going to be like everybody else, because everybody else doesn’t necessarily meet the mark for what military families deserve. We have to know what we’re talking about, what they’re saying, and we have to understand what they’re experiencing. The more and more of our team that we can have with that shared experience, the better.”",https://reservenationalguard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00957-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-22 20:56:12.585083

“Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements.","A Connecticut man has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for his role in a $7.8 million health care fraud and kickback scheme.

Jesse Foote, 60, of Fairfield faced sentencing on Wednesday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

He previously pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

Between December 2017 and March 2021, Foote conspired with overseas telemarking call centers, durable medical equipment suppliers, telemedicine companies and doctors to submit fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs like Medicare and TRICARE, federal officials said. The fraud was described by authorities as a “a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes.”

Authorities said Foote controlled a marketing company through which he purchased patient “leads” from overseas telemarking companies. The leads consisted of information about Medicare and other beneficiaries and pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.

Officials said the call centers targeted Medicare beneficiaries and others with health insurance to persuade them to accept DME, including orthotic braces, whether they needed them or not. Authorities allege Foote paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors to obtain doctors’ orders for DME based on the leads.

“The doctors often approved the DME orders without having any contact with the beneficiary and without making a bona fide assessment that the DME was medically necessary,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote. “Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements. The doctors’ orders were ultimately submitted to DME suppliers, including DME suppliers controlled by Foote, which submitted fraudulent claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs including Medicare, TRICARE, and private insurance companies.”

A total of more than $7.8 million worth of false and fraudulent claims were submitted to health care benefit programs through the scheme, officials said.

During his sentencing, Foote was ordered to serve three years of supervised release once he is released from prison and to pay about $7.8 million in restitution.",https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/court_gavel.jpg?w=640&h=373,N,-1.0,2025-12-21 09:56:19.272177

Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida known for advocating animal rights, has been a vocal proponent of this change.

This decision follows advancements in simulation technology that have rendered the practice obsolete. The prohibition on “live fire” training involving animals is part of this year’s annual defense bill, although certain forms of animal use for wartime training will still be permitted.

Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida known for advocating animal rights, has been a vocal proponent of this change. He lauded the decision as a significant step in alleviating unnecessary suffering in military training practices. “With today’s advanced simulation technology, we can prepare our medics for the battlefield while reducing harm to animals,” Buchanan stated. As Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, he expressed pride in leading efforts to eliminate traditional and inhumane training methods.

Despite this ban, the Defense Department will continue to permit various forms of training that involve inflicting trauma on animals. This includes operations that involve stabbing, burning, and blunt force, as well as the testing of weapons on live animals. While proponents of these practices assert that animals are anesthetized during such training and testing, animal rights groups argue that the use of animals in any form of trauma training should be discontinued altogether.

The Pentagon has deferred media inquiries regarding the new policy to the Defense Health Agency, which is responsible for overseeing training protocols. In response to the new ban, the agency indicated that it is reviewing the guidelines.

Advocacy groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have heralded the change as a victory for animal welfare. They claim it will spare thousands of animals from suffering and marks a transformative move towards more humane and relevant training technologies.

Historically, the military’s use of animals for trauma training has been questioned, with previous legislation aiming to curtail these practices. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicated that the military had received mandates to transition toward human-based training methods. Specifically, a 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to devise a strategy to reduce animal use, while a 2018 statute urged the maximum practical use of simulation technologies.

The GAO’s findings highlighted that while animals have been employed in medical training due to their biological similarities to humans, the effectiveness of using anesthetized pigs and goats has come under scrutiny. Critics, including the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, argue that simulated training via “cut suits” worn by human actors provides a more accurate representation of battlefield wounds and conditions. Retired Navy doctor Erin Griffith emphasized the distinction, noting the critical difference in realism between caring for a living creature and responding to a wounded soldier requiring immediate intervention.

As the military moves forward with this revised policy, the focus remains on developing more humane and effective training methodologies that can better prepare medics for real combat scenarios.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Military-Ends-Use-of-Live-Animals-for-Medic-Training.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-20 15:56:20.089882

The Military CARE Act addresses access-to-care gaps by creating a secure, standardized digital platform for TRICARE beneficiaries to submit and monitor care issues, requiring real-time notifications to patient advocates, directing the Defense Health Agency to analyze complaint trends each quarter, and mandating annual reports to Congress that outline challenges and corrective actions.

“Our military families deserve timely care and a clear path to raise concerns when the system falls short. The Military CARE Act gives service members and their families a direct line to report care access issues and track their resolution, while ensuring Congress has the data needed to identify and fix systemic problems across the military health system,” Rep. Bacon said. “I’m pleased to co-lead this vital effort with Rep. Horsford to strengthen access to care for the families who sacrifice so much in service to our nation.”

“Military families serve our nation and sacrifice so much for it, and they deserve a health care system that serves them just as well,” Rep. Horsford said. “Too many families struggle to get timely appointments or clear information, and they’re left without a reliable way to raise concerns or track whether problems are fixed. This bipartisan bill gives military families a real voice, gives providers the tools to respond quickly, and gives Congress the oversight needed to ensure servicemembers and their loved ones are never left behind.When we support our families, we strengthen the entire force.”

“Access to timely, reliable health care is both a personal issue and a readiness issue. Too often, military families hit administrative roadblocks or long delays with no clear way to raise concerns or track whether problems are being fixed,” Rep. Houlahan said. “The Military CARE Act brings transparency and accountability to the system by giving TRICARE beneficiaries a straightforward way to report access issues and ensures those concerns reach patient advocates and senior leaders. This bipartisan, commonsense bill helps Congress identify systemic gaps and ensures our military health system works for the people it’s meant to serve.”

“Today, America’s servicemembers, veterans, and military families are forced to fight endless red tape and navigate a confusing and deeply frustrating system to get the healthcare they have earned,” Rep. Goodlander said. “That’s not right. Our commonsense bipartisan bill will cut senseless red tape, restore basic accountability, and return the power back where it belongs: with patients. This bill is about ensuring accountability, strengthening readiness, and keeping the sacred promise we make to those who serve our country.”

“Without reliable data and transparency, access-to-care problems in the military health system remain unseen and unresolved,” Lt. Gen. Brian Kelly, USAF (Ret), President and CEO, Military Officers Association of America said. “The Military CARE Act ensures beneficiary experiences are captured, tracked, and reported – giving leaders and Congress the visibility needed to identify systemic issues and drive meaningful, lasting improvements for military families. MOAA is grateful for the bipartisan leadership of Reps. Horsford, Kiggans, Bacon, and Houlahan in advancing this critical reform and MOAA priority.”

The bipartisan Military Care Act, co-led by Reps. Don Bacon (NE-02) Steven Horsford (NV-04), Jen Kiggans (VA-02), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) also includes the following original cosponsors: Reps. Sanford Bishop (GA-02), Maggie Goodlander (NH-02), Sarah McBride (DE-AL), and James Moylan (GU-AL).

This prohibition is included in the latest annual defense bill, indicating a significant shift in military training methodologies. While the ban specifically targets live fire exercises involving animals, other forms of animal use for wartime training will continue.

The initiative was notably pushed forward by Congressman Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida, who has been a vocal advocate for animal rights. He described the decision as “a major step forward in reducing unnecessary suffering in military practices,” emphasizing that modern simulation techniques allow for effective preparation of medics without harming animals. Buchanan, serving as Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, expressed pride in contributing to efforts aimed at phasing out what he considers outdated and inhumane practices.

Despite this prohibition, Buchanan’s office noted that the Department of Defense will still permit training exercises that involve invasive procedures on animals, including stabbing and burning, as well as “weapon wounding,” which entails testing weaponry on animals. Animal rights advocates argue that animals used in these scenarios are typically administered anesthesia to minimize suffering.

The Defense Health Agency, responsible for overseeing medical training, affirmed its commitment to transitioning away from animal models while maintaining high standards of medical training. The establishment of a defense medical modeling and simulation office was highlighted as part of its ongoing efforts to provide realistic training scenarios for service members.

Organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) heralded this decision as a victory, claiming it will save thousands of animals each year and represents a progressive shift towards cutting-edge, human-relevant simulation technology.

While the exact frequency of animal use in military training remains unclear, there have been ongoing legislative efforts aimed at curtailing such practices. A 2022 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicated that previous defense bills have urged the military to adopt human-based training methods. The 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to outline strategies for transitioning away from animal involvement in trauma training, while a 2018 law mandated that simulation technology be utilized as widely as possible, barring instances where animal use was deemed necessary by higher medical authorities.

The GAO report highlighted that live animals like pigs and goats were traditionally used in trauma training due to their anatomical similarities to humans, which provided needed realism in medical training situations. However, critics argue that these methods are inadequate in truly preparing medics for the realities of combat. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has stated that using anesthetized animals does not effectively simulate the experience medics face when treating injured soldiers. Erin Griffith, a retired Navy doctor and member of the committee, remarked that while the idea of caring for a living being may add a layer of realism, it does not capture the chaotic environment of real combat scenarios where injuries occur.

This significant shift reflects advancements in simulation technology that provide more effective and humane alternatives for training medical personnel in battlefield scenarios. The decision to prohibit “live fire” exercises involving animals was included in the recent annual defense bill.

This change has been largely championed by Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Florida Republican known for his advocacy for animal rights. He emphasized that this policy represents a crucial step in reducing unnecessary animal suffering within military training practices. Buchanan noted that modern training techniques can adequately prepare medics without inflicting harm on animals, asserting his commitment to ending outdated methods through his role as Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus.

While the ban focuses on live animal usage for trauma simulations, it will not extend to all forms of animal training. The Defense Department will still permit practices involving the use of animals for various forms of wounding, including stabbing and burning, as well as “weapon wounding” tests. Animal rights activists have criticized these practices, although they assert that animals used in such contexts are typically anesthetized.

The Defense Health Agency, responsible for overseeing military medical training, affirmed its commitment to eliminating animal models while maintaining high-quality training standards. The agency referenced the formation of the Defense Medical Modeling and Simulation Office, which is dedicated to developing realistic training scenarios to ensure medical personnel are equipped to handle combat injuries effectively.

Animal welfare organizations, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, celebrated the legislative shift, claiming it will safeguard thousands of animals annually and marks a transformational move toward modern, human-relevant simulation tools. However, the frequency of animal usage in military training remains unclear. Historical reports indicate that past legislative efforts, including a 2013 defense bill, sought to minimize the reliance on animals for trauma training.
