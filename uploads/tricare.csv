Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days.
A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.
Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained.
He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""","Fifteen Defense Health Agency facilities earned top marks from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for how well they prepare patients to leave the hospital, according to an analysis by Becker’s Hospital Review.

The report identified 15 military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating for “Care Transitions” from CMS. The rating reflects how patients judged their discharge planning and follow-up instructions after an inpatient stay — a critical time in the patient care journey, said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA deputy assistant director, medical affairs.

“A five-star CMS rating in care transitions shows our teams exceed national benchmarks during one of the most risk-prone moments in care,” he said, noting that strong care coordination, teamwork, and patient-centered discharge planning led to the CMS recognition.

CMS listed hospital and clinic ratings based on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, asking patients about their experience during a recent inpatient hospital stay. Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days. The survey was completed between October 2023 and September 2024, and data was updated July 16, 2025.

Awarded military hospitals and clinics

The DHA military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating from CMS included:

60th Medical Group, Travis Air Force Base, California

96th Medical Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi

88th Medical Group, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

99th Medical Group, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Moore, Georgia

Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, North Carolina

Brooke Army Medical Center, Joint Base San Antonio–Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

Cordts said the recognition demonstrates the agency’s commitment to operational readiness: “By taking superior care of the patient, the DHA also takes care of the warfighter.”

Measuring patient experience

CMS scored hospitals and clinics through a survey asking patients to rate their health care experience through three key components:

During this hospital stay, staff took my preferences and those of my family or caregiver into account in deciding what my health care needs would be when I left.

When I left the hospital, I clearly understood the purpose for taking each of my medications.

Dr. Kristen Atterbury, DHA chief nursing officer, said those questions showed patients understood what to do after hospitalization — such as how to manage recovery, take medications correctly, and follow instructions — that can reduce complications and avoidable readmissions. “When we do those three things well, we empower patients, improve safety, and build trust,” she said.

Sharing decision-making, clearly communicating responsibilities, and thorough medication education are “cornerstones of a safe and positive patient experience,” while helping relieve the burden of recovering from injury and illness, Atterbury said. “A stressed and distracted service member is not a ready one.”

Aligning with DHA lines of effort

Cordts and Atterbury said the recognition correlates directly with DHA’s priorities of combat support, care reattraction, and enterprise services optimization.

Combat support “helps the force stay ready. A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.

Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained. He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""

Enterprise services optimization “uses what works and spreading it across the whole system,” Atterbury said. “The goal is to take strong steps — such as good discharge checklists and follow-up calls — and use them everywhere. This creates a standardized playbook for excellence, optimizing performance, reducing unwanted variation, and elevating the quality of care across the entire enterprise.”

The award gives DHA the opportunity to share best practices across the MHS, using patient feedback to refine discharge planning, medication counseling, and follow-up coordination — equipping warfighters to stay healthy while continuing recovery at home. This phase of the patient care journey can be vital to stay ready, said Atterbury. “A stable, and well-supported family at home enables a focused, mission-ready force in the field.”

Ultimately, the high marks received from CMS demonstrate DHA’s commitment to mission readiness, said Cordts.

“Excelling at care transitions is a strategic linchpin for the DHA,” he said. “It simultaneously enhances warfighter readiness by ensuring family well-being, attracts patients back to the direct care system, and provides a blueprint for system-wide improvement that is central to enterprise optimization.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9124347/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-13 15:56:38.743107

Through this program, your family is connected with an Autism Services Navigator (ASN) who will be your advocate and guide you through the process of getting ABA therapy covered by TRICARE.

If your child received their autism diagnosis after October 1, 2021, they have been assigned an ASN. If your child was diagnosed before then, or if they have not yet been diagnosed, reach out to your local BlueSprig team, who can provide assistance with understanding your TRICARE benefits or connect you with diagnosis resources in your area.

In addition to your ASN, BlueSprig will also work with you to get started. Our team follows all TRICARE requirements as well as state laws and regulations. We’ll also help you with paperwork for any assessments or approvals your child needs.

We understand that military families may often have to move to a new location. With that in mind, our teams are here to help identify support networks, physicians, and more, while supporting any changes in station that may occur during enrollment.

At Bluesprig, we make coordination of care a priority, so we coordinate with your child’s other service providers for better outcomes.

Your family’s ASN will assist in scheduling meetings between all of your child’s providers. If you do not have an ASN, BlueSprig will work with the providers directly to arrange a meeting to increase interdisciplinary support.

TRICARE and BlueSprig value parent involvement in their child’s services and recognize the impact of parents who are part of the overall treatment team. We will work closely with each child’s family to support that child’s growth while also aligning with TRICARE’s requirements for service delivery and parent participation.

BlueSprig is committed to recognizing and valuing the contributions of the military community within the communities we serve.

The Military, Veterans, and Military Families Employee Resource Group at BlueSprig brings together current and former military personnel, family members of those who have served, and supportive allies. With a focus on enhancing outreach, recruitment, and retention strategies aimed at supporting the military, veterans, and their families, this group embodies the spirit of unity and support.

In 2025 the pharmacy filled more than 187,000 individual prescriptions for service members, retirees, and family members, in addition to supporting clinical operations.

Munson’s outpatient pharmacists work behind the scenes and at the pharmacy counter to ensure medications are safe, effective and appropriate for each patient, helping service members remain healthy and ready to perform their missions.

“Our pharmacists do far more than fill prescriptions,” said Capt. Michael Nguyen, Chief of Munson’s Department of Pharmacy. “They are an essential part of the healthcare team, helping patients understand their medications, preventing harmful drug interactions and working closely with providers to support the best possible outcomes.”

Munson pharmacists also play a critical role in patient safety and readiness by identifying potential medication errors before prescriptions are dispensed, ensuring patients understand how to take their medications correctly, and helping minimize side effects that could impact performance.

“Every prescription represents multiple safety checks,” said Dr. Jason Brozek, an outpatient pharmacist and supervisor at Munson. “Our goal is to make sure patients leave the pharmacy confident about their medications and how they support their health.”

In Munson’s Department of Primary Care, Dr. Marketa Lanier, a clinical pharmacist and part of the primary care team, works directly with patients to manage chronic conditions, optimize medication therapy, and support overall health.

“The most fulfilling part of my job is seeing the positive impact of my work,” said Lanier, who was named the 2024 Defense Health Agency Clinical Pharmacist of the Year. “When a patient comes back and tells me how much better and energetic they feel when their blood sugars are controlled or how a small tool like a medication card has helped them, it reminds me why I love what I do.”

Patients are encouraged to speak with a pharmacist if they have questions about their medications or pharmacy services.

Pharmacy services for TRICARE beneficiaries and readiness support The outpatient pharmacy serves all eligible TRICARE beneficiaries, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Pharmacy services are designed to support continuity of care and safe medication use, whether patients are managing a short-term illness or a long-term condition.

Munson’s pharmacy is open weekdays from 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. All NEW and RENEWAL prescriptions require activation before they may be picked up. Call913-684-6250, Option #2 to activate prescriptions by phone.

On Friday, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall visited Irwin Army Community Hospital at Fort Riley in anticipation of a new agreement expected later this month that will expand healthcare access for veterans in the Flint Hills region.

Senator Marshall has worked for more than a year with local, state, and federal leaders to protect Irwin Army Community Hospital after reports that the Defense Health Agency was considering downgrading the hospital to an acute care clinic, threatening emergency, surgical, and maternity care options in the North Central Flint Hills Region.

Senator Marshall said, “Fort Riley’s hospital is not just a critical piece of readiness for our soldiers, it’s also a lifeline for families and veterans across the Flint Hills.

During the Building a Healthy Home Front forum, at the Association of the United States Army’s 2025 annual meeting, Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre, Surgeon General of the Army, said, “We’re working with our partners at the Defense Health Agency to effectively support that treatment part of the health, bringing virtual care to remote areas…(and) leveraging technology…and humans to provide care.”

“If we can leverage AI to be that entryway, and then triage, then we can preserve those human touchpoints that need that level of care,” she said.

BRAVE has hosted approximately 60,000 virtual therapy sessions since it was launched three years ago. The program is now available at 84 locations across the U.S., Europe and Indo-Pacific region. DHA plans for BRAVE to be available worldwide by the end of this year.

In a release from DHA, the agency said BRAVE has used teleconferencing to reduce patient wait times and provide confidential access to therapy services. The platform’s team of service providers consists of licensed clinical social workers, psychologists and therapists.

BRAVE is managed by the DHA Virtual Medical Center, which offers several other telehealth tools, including the VMC Virtually Integrated Provider Readiness and Remote Clinic, the MHS Patient Portal and MHS Nurse Advice Line. DHA VMC ensures that members of the Army community receive the best possible care through modernized military medicine.

DHA’s BRAVE virtual services are not to be confused with My Military Health’s SilverCloud, which ended in July of this year. The confidential self-help platform provided advice for managing emotions and stress, but it did not offer formal behavioral health treatment. MHS also announced the sunsetting of MHS Video Connect in July.

The TRICARE decision and recent revenue update sit against a strong run in the shares, with a 90 day share price return of 76.1% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 189.16%, suggesting momentum has been building despite a weaker 5 year total shareholder return of 30.84%.

If Guardant Health has you rethinking the healthcare theme, this could be a good moment to size up other that are catching investors' attention.

With Guardant Health now trading near US$110 after a sharp run and analysts’ targets clustered around roughly US$120, plus an intrinsic value estimate at a larger discount, the real question is whether there is still a buying opportunity here or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 6.8% Undervalued

The widely followed narrative sets fair value for Guardant Health at about US$118, a touch above the last close near US$110, framing today’s optimism in numbers.

Substantial regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical validation milestones (including Shield's breakthrough device status, NCCN guideline inclusion, and ongoing pilot studies) are paving the way for further guideline adoption, expanded payer coverage, and commercial inflections in Shield/MCED and Reveal volumes, significantly increasing future revenue and earnings visibility.

Want to see how this story translates into the valuation gap? The narrative leans hard on rapid revenue scaling, margin shift and an aggressive future earnings multiple. Curious what combination of growth, profitability and discount rate has to line up for that to hold?

Result: Fair Value of $118.18 (UNDERVALUED)

However, the story could shift quickly if high R&D and cash burn lead to fresh equity raises, or if payer adoption for Shield and other tests underwhelms.

Another View: High Growth, Higher Expectations

Our DCF model presents a different perspective. On this view, Guardant Health at US$110.17 sits about 37.5% below an estimated fair value of roughly US$176.29, which suggests the shares may be undervalued if those long term cash flow assumptions prove accurate. Which storyline do you find more convincing?

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, an experienced clinician, combat veteran, educator, and health care leader, recently reflected on the pivotal work of the Military Health System in 2025, which delivered visible gains in readiness-focused partnerships, increased productivity, revamped credentialing and privileging process, and early deployments of artificial intelligence tools to give clinicians more time with patients.

On Jan. 20, 2025, Ferrara was appointed as the principal deputy assistant secretary of war for health affairs and immediately stepped in as the acting assistant secretary for health affairs until the official nominee, Keith Bass, was confirmed by the Senate Jan. 5, 2026.

Bass has now assumed duties as the assistant secretary.

Ferrara is a retired U.S. Navy doctor with 25 years on active duty and remains a practicing physician. Prior to rejoining the DOW, he was the Chief Medical Officer at the CIA. He also served as the deputy director for clinical operations for the National Capital Region, the DOW’s largest health care network. He currently serves as an interventional radiologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and is a clinical professor of radiology and radiological sciences at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

In this interview, Ferrara discussed the critical priorities for the MHS, such as upgrading infrastructure, maintaining clinical readiness, and strengthening the pipeline of talented professionals dedicated to delivering the best possible care for warfighters.

Following are edited excerpts from the interview, which can be viewed in its entirety on www.health.mil:

Question: You often talk about the “3 S’s” for the Military Health System: supporting the warfighter, sustaining our skills, and strengthening our chain. What do they mean?

Ferrara: Those principles underpin our mission: support the warfighter. We provide health care to the people who defend our country, and that's what makes us unique as a health care system. There are many great health care systems in America — but there's only one great American health care system that goes to war. Fundamentally, our focus is to support the warfighter.

Sustaining our skills means our learned skills must be maintained. I liken it to how our aviators have to get flight hours or how the trigger-pullers go to the range. For our health care professionals, it's working in our MTFs (military treatment facilities) where we're taking care of patients and keeping sharp. We have to be great because our warfighters deserve our very best.

On strengthening our chain: We stand on the shoulders of many great people, both in the military and in military medicine — so it's on all of us to make sure that we pass along that wisdom. Our MTFs are a giant force-generation platform. We graduate 16,000 medical technologists with a variety of skill sets every single year. If we were a university, we'd be the biggest one. We have graduate medical education programs. We have nursing training programs across our entire enterprise. We are always training people to be able to take that baton from us and continue to be a world-class health care system.

Question: It's been an action-packed year when you look back at 2025. How would you characterize a few of our greatest successes?

Ferrara: First of all, we perform on the big picture with great success, including increasing our partnerships. I think we've done a lot to bring in more patients, higher-complexity patients, which improves our force-generation and our skill-sustainment platforms. We've brought in more Medicare patients, and we’re really happy to be able to take care of them. Similarly, with the Department of Veterans Affairs, we've strengthened our partnership to take care of America’s veterans.

We've made significant efforts to reduce administrative burden and improve quality of life. I'm very sensitive to the burdens we place on those who care for patients, because that's what they love to do. We now have universal privileging, which is a significant breakthrough, as it eliminates low-value administrative work such as renewing privileges or obtaining transfer briefs. If you're good enough to work at one MTF, you can work across the enterprise. It also helps our mission by increasing agility, capacity, and capability by giving us the ability to utilize our personnel where and when we need them.

We rolled out ambient listening, an artificial intelligence-powered tool to help bring humanity back to health care. There’s the burden of how much note writing providers have to do, where people are taking work home. With this new tool, you can have a nice, captured conversation with your patient, talk to them, and really be focused and centered on the patient. Ambient listening rolled out at four sites this fall and we're looking to distribute that across the enterprise in 2026.

Question: Speaking about AI in a broader context, are there other priorities that you've set for the MHS to incorporate that technology?

Ferrara: We’re in a golden moment for medicine in terms of all the technology occurring, and AI is a big element of that. AI can also accelerate personalized medicine with the molecular and genetic techniques that we have. For drug discovery and development, AI can enable better therapies for patients.

Clinicians can use AI to make more rapid diagnoses and more rapid treatments, and technologies to empower and enable those frontline medics and corpsmen to be able to do prolonged field care. We’re leaning into our forward-deployable technology platforms, using tools enabling medics and corpsmen right at the point of injury to begin documenting the service member’s medical record. To support clinical decision-making, technology can provide access immediately to guide care for those service members, so we can maximize survivability in the war fight.

Question: You spent a significant amount of time this year going to the deck plate and visiting MTFs around the world. What are your biggest takeaways from those visits, and have you had the chance to incorporate any of the feedback that you've learned when you've been on the ground?

Ferrara: It's always really energizing and restorative for me to get out to the field and see where the work is done. I try to meet as many staff as I can, whether I'm in the operational unit or at an MTF. One of the things I share with them is why it's so important for me to go to the field. Here at the Pentagon, we’re making a lot of decisions, but we have such a large and complex health care system … sometimes the nature of the information gets heavily filtered by the time it gets to me.

When I go to those places, I can learn what it's like to be there. I don't think people at our MTFs or operational units are a mere row in an Excel spreadsheet. There's a lot more to it than that. These are people who are taking care of patients. It's really helpful for me to hear their stories, and I learn a lot from them. Whether it’s simple or about policy, I come back with a punch list of things to help fix.

Question: Can you talk a little bit about what happened at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center earlier in January 2025, one of your first experiences as acting assistant secretary?

Ferrara: Walter Reed, the President's hospital, experienced facility challenges including flooding. Like many of our facilities, they have aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance. I compliment their staff for moving heaven and earth to ensure they always took care of their patients. I went out there and walked the spaces, and then was able to go right to Congress and say, “here are the infrastructure problems, and we need support.” In the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, they gave us $2 billion specifically because of those efforts. We can apply it to help close some of the gaps at our facilities with the greatest challenges for infrastructure. I think we came out of it really well, and that's where that kind of advocacy on the Hill can be invaluable.

Question: What are some of the biggest resource-related challenges and successes for the MHS right now?

Ferrara: I'm a people-oriented leader — I believe having not only the right number of people but also the right skill types and in the right places — because health care is a very personal craft that we do.

We faced challenges early in the year with our civilian teammates as we sought to preserve many positions, but we were very successful because we were able to show how valuable everyone on our team is.

In the last several months of the fiscal year, we implemented policies and increased revenue collections by about $700 million. That's really exciting, because we can take those resources and we can use them to hire people, work on infrastructure, and focus on things that we need.

The National Defense Authorization Act (Fiscal Year 2026) was passed, and we're getting a top-line increase as a department. I'm looking forward to more financial resources that we can then deploy to improve health care for our warfighters and beneficiaries.

Question: What’s the value of welcoming TRICARE For Life beneficiaries back into certain MTFs for patients and for providers?

Ferrara: First and foremost, we're a military family. The opportunity to welcome our TRICARE For Life patients, our seniors, back into the MTFs where they want to get their care is the right thing to do, because it's bringing people in who want to get care from us. They trust us. They've been with us for most of their life.

It also provides high-quality, outstanding care for patients. They get their medications, imaging, and specialist visits, and they have a great patient experience. It's great for skill sustainment when health care professionals are seeing more complex patients, continuing to hone their skills and keep them sharp.

Question: How do you see strengthening the partnership the MHS has with the Department of Veterans Affairs?

Ferrara: The VA can have more demand than they can supply, and we often have more supply; we have excess supply. It’s a great opportunity to meet both of our missions across the country. Veterans may have more complex medical issues than our young, active duty personnel who are often healthy. It provides a robust clinical mix for us and is culturally aligned. Veterans enjoy receiving care at our MTFs. It provides another source of revenue, and it's good for the taxpayer. It’s a great opportunity and unique in government, where we can have wins across the board.

One example of how this has been successful is in El Paso (William Beaumont Army Medical Center). The VA and the hospital have partnered, referring 12,000 surgical patients a year to us. This can generate high value for our combat readiness mission in neurosurgery, orthopedics, and general surgery.

Prosecutors say Loftis, through Back Pain Home Supplies LLC — which did business as EZ Medical Supply — paid kickbacks to marketers and telehealth providers for patient referrals and signed orders, then submitted claims for unnecessary or improperly provided braces, resulting in roughly $8 million in payments. Loftis is also accused of misusing more than $133,000 in COVID-19 Provider Relief Fund money for personal expenses and to further the scheme.

Loftis is charged with health care fraud, kickback conspiracy and theft of government funds; if convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years in prison on the conspiracy and kickback count and 10 years on each of the theft of government property counts.

National Guard members, like all service members, commit years of their lives to ensure the safety and security of our country. We are expected to be ever-ready, to serve at a moment’s notice, and to make sacrifices that often take us away from our families.

However, upon retirement, this benefit is stripped away, leaving many to face overwhelming costs just to maintain the same standards of care.

MMR/V Surveillance in the Military Health System

A surveillance report evaluated measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMR/V) among service members and other beneficiaries of the U.S. Military Health System (MHS) from 2019 through 2024. Investigators queried the Defense Medical Surveillance System to identify both confirmed and possible MMR/V cases during the six-year period.

Across all MHS beneficiaries, the total counts included 8 confirmed and 71 possible measles cases, 18 confirmed and 193 possible mumps cases, 13 confirmed and 265 possible rubella cases, and 251 confirmed and 4,554 possible varicella cases. Over the surveillance window, the report described decreasing numbers of confirmed and possible cases for all four infections.

Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Case Patterns

Varicella accounted for the largest number of reported infections in this dataset, including both confirmed and possible cases. Measles case counts were low overall, and the authors reported that no measles cases were observed among U.S. service members during the surveillance period.

The report also described vaccination status among service members with MMR/V. Most service member cases were reported as either partially vaccinated, or having vaccination records that were not available in the queried data. The authors noted that MMR/V cases decreased over time and highlighted continued vaccination against MMR/V as a factor in limiting morbidity among U.S. service members, pointing to lower case counts in service members, who are required to be vaccinated, compared with non-service members.

There is nothing that says you have to use the VA. But it does work out cheaper cost wise if you get the care you need. I have Tricare select currently and continue to pay the monthly premium for my dependents. I use it when I want a second opinion or just don't feel like messing with the VA.

If, for some reason, the VA can not or is unable to react to your condition, Medicare and tricare will cover everything. The reason to get Medicare part B is that if you need it later and don't get it at 65 there are huge penalties for it.

Since my work insurance lapsed about 4 months ago, I assumed I was covered under Tricare (we went to the VA office & made me his dependent shortly after our marriage).

Long story short, I recently found out I am pregnant & when I made my OB/GYN appointments I learned that I was actually never enrolled in Tricare. Open season ended over a month ago & I have been incredibly stressed out since I learned that I have zero health insurance.

We submitted a ""request to enroll outside of the enrollment period"" but I have been told it can take up to 45 days to receive an answer. In the meantime, I cannot avoid getting ultrasounds and going to the doctor. If we pay up front & Tricare agrees to enroll late, then they will cover these bills retroactively (and likely reimburse us), which would be amazing. However, in the event they deny our request, we will be back at square one, sans insurance, and left with bills we cannot afford.

In short, I am seeking advice or just stories from anyone who has been in a similar boat.
