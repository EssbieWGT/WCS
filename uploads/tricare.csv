“TFL provides Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B, regardless of their age or where they live,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency. “In the U.S. and U.S. territories, Medicare and TRICARE work together to minimize your out-of-pocket costs. If you get care overseas, TRICARE For Life becomes your primary coverage, unless you have other health insurance.”

When you move, you’ll need to update your address. You’ll also need to explore your options for getting care and filling prescriptions.

Updating your address After you move, you need to update your address in a few places.

In the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System: Learn how to update your address in DEERS. You should also confirm that the rest of your DEERS record is correct.

With the Social Security Administration: Social Security maintains beneficiary records on behalf of Medicare. To update your address with Medicare, log in to your my Social Security account or call Social Security at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778).

With the TRICARE pharmacy contractor: Update your address with Express Scripts if you use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. You can do this by logging in to your Express Scripts account or calling Express Scripts.

Moving within or to the U.S. or U.S. territories Medicare provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

If you have TFL and use Original Medicare (Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B), you can get care from Medicare participating and Medicare nonparticipating providers. You can find and compare Medicare providers in your new location.

You can also see providers who’ve opted out of Medicare. But keep in mind that Medicare doesn’t pay for services you get from opt-out providers. Learn more about getting care from Medicare providers and opt-out providers.

Are you enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan? If you move out of its service area, you’re eligible for a Medicare Special Enrollment Period. This means you’re eligible to enroll in a new Medicare Advantage Plan (Medicare Part C) and Medicare drug plan (Medicare Part D) or switch to Original Medicare. Learn more about Special Enrollment Periods.

If you have questions about Medicare, contact Medicare. In the U.S. and U.S. territories, WPS Military and Veterans Health administers the TFL benefit. Contact WPS if you have questions about TFL.

Moving overseas If you move overseas and you have Medicare Part A, you must also have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL. Even though Medicare doesn’t provide coverage outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, you must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums.

If you have TFL: • TRICARE is the primary payer for TRICARE-covered services and supplies, unless you have other health insurance. • You can get TRICARE-covered services and supplies from any TRICARE-authorized provider. (In the Philippines, you must get care from a Preferred Provider Network provider or a certified provider.) • If you get covered services from a network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will generally be lower than if you see a non-network provider. Search the overseas provider directory to find a network provider. • You’ll pay TRICARE cost-shares after you meet your TRICARE annual deductible. • You may need pre-authorization for some services.

International SOS is the TRICARE overseas contractor. Contact International SOS for help with finding providers, getting authorizations, filing claims, and more.

TRICARE Plus Have you moved close to a military hospital or clinic? You may be able to enroll in TRICARE Plus. TRICARE Plus is a health care program offered at some military hospitals and clinics. Contact your local military hospital or clinic to see if they offer the program.

Note: You can’t enroll in TRICARE Plus if you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan health maintenance organization option.

Filling prescriptions You may have different pharmacy options depending on where you move: • Military pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in some U.S. territories and some locations overseas. Find a military pharmacy near you. • TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery will ship to any address in the U.S. or U.S. territories. This includes APO, FPO, and DPO addresses. There are different rules for using home delivery in other overseas locations. • TRICARE retail network pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in most U.S. territories. Find a network pharmacy near you. • At non-network pharmacies, you’ll have to pay full price for your prescription drugs. Then you can file a claim for reimbursement. Overseas, a non-network pharmacy might be your only pharmacy option. In the Philippines, you must fill prescriptions at a certified pharmacy. Learn more about filling prescriptions overseas.

Your family members When you have TFL, moving isn’t a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event for you. But moving is a QLE for family members who are enrolled in or eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. Your family members should also update their address in DEERS after they move.

For aspiring mental health professionals eager to care for those who serve, the https://deploymentpsych.org/ (CDP) at the Uniformed Services University (USU) offers a rare and transformative experience — the https://deploymentpsych.org/the-summer-institute. Since 2015, this immersive program has helped future psychologists and social workers chart a course toward impactful careers supporting military service members, veterans, and their families. This year’s three-day session, held July 15–17 on USU’s Bethesda, Maryland campus, once again drew top students from across the country to learn, connect, and envision their future in military behavioral health.

The Summer Institute: Born from Necessity, Shaped by Evolution

The Summer Institute addresses a critical national shortage of mental health providers and highlights those career opportunities within the framework of military populations. Part of the design was, “How do we create a program that helps to highlight a career option in terms of serving military populations as an active duty behavioral health officer?"" explains Dr. Timothy Rogers, Pathways Program associate director.

The program began with a focus on psychology students preparing for internships, but over the years it has expanded to include first-year doctoral students, providing them with early exposure to the knowledge and skills needed for military careers. This strategic evolution allows students to explore military behavioral health as a potential career path well before they begin advanced training.

To make the program more accessible, the Summer Institute was streamlined from five days to three. Along with this change, the curriculum shifted its focus from how to perform the job to what the job entails. By consolidating previously scattered information on military and civilian opportunities, the program gives participants a clearer picture of the field, helping them determine whether this unique career path aligns with their aspirations and talents.

And new this year, the Summer Institute expanded in 2024 to include a track for social workers. This expansion underscores CDP's commitment to a ""total force concept"" for career paths, encompassing not just active duty but also other uniformed services and civilian opportunities within the DoD and VA. This inclusion strives to help with the high demand for mental health services and the challenges for access to care that can arise within the Military Health System. Rogers emphasizes, ""there's a high demand and there's a real need and we need really good clinicians to help take care of our service members and veterans and family members in all of our communities.""

Distinguished Speakers and Diverse Perspectives

This year's three-day program includes both a psychology and social work track. Both tracks share a foundational curriculum, beginning with a welcome and overview by Rogers. Afterwards, guests attend a distinguished session on the importance of military mental health with retired Lt. Gen. Raymond “Scott” Dingle, the U.S. Army’s 45th Surgeon General, and retired Command Sergeant Major Diamond D. Hough, the 20th Command Sergeant Major of the Army Medical Command.

Participants in both tracks will gain an in-depth understanding of military culture through sessions tailored to their fields. Psychology students will learn from Dr. Debra Nofziger, a former active-duty Army psychologist, while social work students will hear from Dr. Katrice Byrd and Ms. Allison Hannah, both military behavioral health social workers with the CDP. Additional presenters — ranging from early-career professionals sharing insights on first assignments to seasoned experts discussing long-term career growth and broader industry trends — round out the program. While both tracks feature recruiter presentations and training directors’ panels, students will also join together for collaborative activities, then break into discipline-specific sessions for more focused learning.

The Summer Institute goes beyond simply offering an overview — it provides concrete, practical guidance for building a career in military behavioral health. Students gain insider perspectives on the application process, including how to navigate the complexities of recruiting and the Medical Examination Processing Station (MEPS). The CDP also equips participants with long-term career tools and strategies. Suggestions include tailoring class projects toward military psychology topics and seeking clinical training experiences that align with military needs. As Rogers explains, the program is designed to be “a platform for people to learn,” filling a gap in education where few programs offer in-depth insight into this specialized career path.

Proven Impact and Future Vision

The program’s impact is clear in its consistently high satisfaction ratings and the large proportion of alumni who go on to military internships or related roles. Since its launch 10 years ago, more than 548 students from over 130 doctoral programs in 34 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico have taken part in the Summer Institute. This year alone, 56 participants completed the program.

Looking ahead, the initiative will expand into three distinct events: the Summer Institute, focused on active-duty careers; a fall event highlighting other uniformed career paths such as the Public Health Service or Coast Guard; and a winter institute dedicated to civilian opportunities within the DoD and VA. To broaden reach, the fall and winter programs will be held virtually, making them accessible to an even wider pool of future professionals.

""I'm always excited to work with students,"" Rogers shares, ""always excited to help them to realize that working with our military population can be extremely rewarding"". He concludes, ""there are real problems that need real solutions and we need people who are well trained to meet that moment"". The Summer Institute is a crucial stepping stone for those ready to meet that moment.",,N,1.0,2026-01-01 11:56:33.964606

Dr. William Kelly isn’t your typical military physician—he’s a game-changer in military medical education. From leading medical students through rotations at military medical centers across the country to pioneering educational innovation, Kelly is transforming the way future military doctors learn. His drive for growth led him to earn a Master’s in Health Professions Education (HPE) from the Uniformed Services University (USU), where he enhanced his teaching strategies and integrated interactive learning techniques, including gamification. His mission? To equip students with the tools they need to become confident, self-sufficient leaders in military medicine.

Kelly, a professor of Medicine and clerkship director at USU’s F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, also serves as a pulmonary physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Whether in the classroom or at the bedside, his leadership helps shape the next generation of military physicians, ensuring they receive the education, training, and experience necessary for success.

“I’ve been fortunate to learn from exceptional mentors and students,” Kelly says. “The HPE program appealed to me as a way to solidify my teaching methods, delve deeper into leadership and educational theories, and refine my research practices,” he adds.

Dr. Steven Durning, HPE department chair and director of the Center for Health Professions Education (CHPE) at USU, explains that CHPE offers certificate and degree programs for active-duty and civilian health professionals at U.S. military treatment facilities. These programs enhance academic leadership, educational research, and teaching skills through primarily online asynchronous learning, designed for busy healthcare professionals. To date, more than 450 learners have graduated, with over 300 currently enrolled.

Kelly’s research focuses on assessment, test-taking skills, and interactive learning. He recognizes that even brilliant clinicians can struggle with standardized test formats. Through self-regulated learning analysis and coaching, the clerkship equips students with strategies to overcome these hurdles—skills that translate into broader professional success.

""We focus on growing independence,"" Kelly explains. ""Our goal is to help these future leaders and healers transition from the classroom to the demanding world of internship, regardless of their chosen specialty."" His approach involves close collaboration with clinical supervisors and continuous feedback to ensure student success.

Kelly sees his HPE knowledge directly influencing his work as a professor and clerkship director. ""These individuals face unique challenges,"" he acknowledges. ""The HPE program has equipped me with tools to address these challenges, particularly in areas like learner remediation."" He leverages self-regulated learning techniques to help students overcome hurdles and become independent learners.

Kelly’s vision for medical education goes beyond traditional methods. He is a proponent of gamification—integrating game mechanics into learning experiences. His enthusiasm was evident at last year’s Military Health System conference, where he delivered a compelling talk on the subject.

""Learning is serious business,"" Kelly asserts, ""but teaching modalities don't have to be."" He believes educational games can enhance engagement, teamwork, and knowledge retention through repetition and feedback. Kelly has designed and implemented interactive learning programs since 2001. In collaboration with other experts, he helped develop the CHEST Challenge program, initially aimed at pulmonary/critical care fellows in the U.S. and Canada. Today, it includes high-fidelity simulation, live actors, and rigorous assessment methods. Since 2012, Kelly has introduced innovative educational games, such as diagnostic ultrasound training, escape rooms, and live medical knowledge game shows at professional conferences.

For military healthcare professionals considering an HPE degree, Kelly’s advice is: “Go for it!” He emphasizes the program’s ability to refine leadership and teaching skills, while also recognizing the value of the credential. Despite the time commitment, he assures it is manageable alongside a busy clinical schedule.

""The program is incredibly flexible,"" Kelly assures, ""and the benefits far outweigh the investment, especially considering the financial advantage of pursuing it within the military framework.""

Durning says Kelly's dedication and hard work were evident throughout his time in the HPE master’s degree program. “Dr. Kelly flourished in the MHPE program, excelling in all facets and producing an important and timely paper in Academic Medicine entitled Assessment Tools for Patient Notes in Medical Education: A Scoping Review.”

Kelly’s journey is proof that great educators never stop learning. From the bedside to the classroom—and even the game board—he is redefining how military medical students engage with education. His passion for teaching, commitment to innovation, and drive to help students succeed make him a transformative force in military medical education. And with his HPE degree in hand, he is more prepared than ever to shape the next generation of confident, capable military physicians.",,N,0.0,2026-01-01 11:56:36.654092

Opioid overdoses are a serious public health crisis, and the Uniformed Services University (USU), in collaboration with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Research & Engineering Implementation Science Branch, is tackling this issue head-on with the Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) Program. This initiative focuses on increasing access to naloxone, a life-saving antidote, and educating both providers and patients about its importance.

The Need for Naloxone Access and Education

While many recognize the dangers of opioids and their link to fatal overdoses, awareness of naloxone—an emergency medication that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose—remains limited. Addressing the opioid crisis requires not only understanding the risks of opioid use but also ensuring widespread knowledge and availability of naloxone. Despite its life-saving potential, naloxone remains historically underprescribed.

One contributing factor is that some prescribers assume their patients are unlikely to misuse opioids. Others may hesitate due to the stigma surrounding naloxone use. However, the reality is that anyone prescribed opioids faces a risk of accidental overdose. Factors such as medication interactions, alcohol consumption, or a weakened immune system can all increase this risk. Since 2019, the OEND program has worked to de-stigmatize conversations about opioid use and expand access to naloxone, ensuring that more people are prepared to prevent overdose deaths.

Creating the OEND Program: A Collaborative Effort

The Defense and Veterans Center for Integrated Pain Management (DVCIPM) at USU, inspired by the Veterans Administration’s Opioid Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, partnered with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to tailor the initiative for the Military Health System (MHS). Leading this effort are Dr. Kris Highland, associate professor of Anesthesiology at USU, and retired Army Col. Kevin Galloway, DVCIPM’s director for Strategic Communications and Policy. Galloway also highlights the pivotal contributions of retired Army Col. (Dr.) Chester Buckenmaier III, DVCIPM’s founding director, in shaping the MHS pain management infrastructure.

A key element of OEND is encouraging providers to “co-prescribe” naloxone alongside opioid painkillers for patients with elevated overdose risks, including those on long-term opioid therapy, high opioid doses, concurrent respiratory depressants (such as benzodiazepines), or with a history of behavioral health conditions. This sustained effort has led to an impressive 79.5% compliance rate for co-prescribing naloxone.

How Naloxone Saves Lives

Naloxone is a fast-acting medication that temporarily reverses opioid overdoses by restoring breathing. Administered via IV or nasal spray, it works by binding to opioid receptors, blocking the effects of opioids, and counteracting the respiratory depression that can be fatal. While naloxone can be used by anyone in an emergency, it is not a replacement for professional medical care. Its effects are temporary, and individuals who receive naloxone still require immediate medical attention to ensure their safety and prevent a recurrence of overdose symptoms.

OEND’s Three-Phase Approach

The OEND program is specifically tailored to the MHS to bridge the gap between policy and practice. Highland’s team discovered that despite existing DoD policies promoting naloxone distribution, prescribing rates remained stagnant. While these policies allowed both physicians and pharmacists to prescribe naloxone and outlined opioid safety and pain management guidelines, they lacked the necessary programming and tools to effectively disseminate this information, slowing meaningful change.

To address this, the program was structured into three phases. Phase One began with interviews of clinicians and pharmacists to assess training and resource needs. Collaborating with OEND champions at Madigan Army Medical Center, the team developed targeted tools and training to enhance access to patient prescription history, improve provider-patient discussions about naloxone, and reduce stigma surrounding its use. Training focused on locating opioid prescription history and overdose risk indicators in CarePoint, initiating informed conversations with patients, and addressing stigma among both healthcare providers and patients.

A post-training review of 47 participating clinicians and pharmacists revealed that most regularly worked with patients concerned about opioid risks, and roughly 40% had received direct naloxone information requests from patients or caregivers.

Following the training, prescribers reported increased confidence in normalizing conversations about naloxone and educating patients on its benefits. Open discussions about opioid safety are essential—covering medication storage, access, and disposal, as well as how conditions like sleep apnea and medications such as benzodiazepines can heighten the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression. ""Patients sometimes forget they've taken their medication and accidentally double-dose,"" Highland explains. ""Or they take their medication as prescribed, have a couple of drinks, and don't realize they've increased their risk of respiratory depression. Many things can happen accidentally. Empowering patients with knowledge for informed health decisions is a key component of OEND,"" Highland emphasizes.

Reaching a Wider Audience

In collaboration with the DHA, the OEND Program launched a dedicated Health.mil page to provide comprehensive resources for patients, caregivers, providers, and trainers. This centralized hub offers opioid fact sheets, infographics, videos, and train-the-trainer handbooks—all in one accessible location. Designed to support prescribers, pharmacists, and OEND champions, the site ensures that critical information is readily available to those who need it. A complementary social media campaign further amplifies the program’s reach, reinforcing the importance of naloxone education and accessibility. As Galloway emphasizes, “What if you had a fire extinguisher but didn’t know what it does?”

An Ongoing Effort

The OEND program remains committed to continuous improvement, ensuring providers have the tools and knowledge to engage patients effectively. “The teaching is different now,” Galloway explains. “We’re no longer just telling medical students to ‘treat the pain, treat the pain.’” While recent data suggests a decline in overdose deaths, Galloway attributes this to a combination of factors, including expanded naloxone access, harm reduction efforts, and greater awareness. He underscores that DVCIPM is not anti-opioid—these medications can be invaluable when prescribed and used responsibly. “The culture [around opioid prescribing] is still in the process of changing, and we’re better than we were, but not quite as good as we need to be,” he says.

Looking ahead, Highland highlights the program’s vision for a “triple risk-reduction kit”—a comprehensive emergency care package combining defibrillators, Stop the Bleed supplies, and naloxone. “We can’t predict where someone will have an overdose event, we can’t predict where there will be a mass casualty event such as a mass shooting, and we can’t predict when and where someone will have a cardiovascular incident that requires a defibrillator,” Highland notes. “So if you were to put those three together, and create awareness around that and create training information on how to use each part of the triple kit, then that would be the new emergency care kit that would be available to people.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-31 23:12:06.389513

Surgeons from the Uniformed Services University (USU) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) have earned national recognition for their dedication to surgical excellence and outstanding patient outcomes. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®) awarded WRNMMC the prestigious Meritorious Achievement Award for 2023, placing the joint team among an elite group of just 77 hospitals out of 609 eligible participants. WRNMMC received this recognition in November 2024.

Faculty from both the USU and Walter Reed comprise the surgical team. WRNMMC has participated in the NSQIP program for over 10 years, building a long-standing tradition of providing nationally recognized excellent surgical care.

The Meritorious Achievement Award is based on a rigorous evaluation of risk-adjusted data in the July 2024 ACS NSQIP Semiannual Report, which analyzed surgical outcomes across eight key clinical areas. The USU-Walter Reed surgical team’s performance placed them in the top 10% of participating hospitals nationwide, including both Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and private sector hospitals. They also received distinctions of ""exemplary"" in all-case morbidity, all-case urinary tract infection, and all-case surgical site infection. Participation in the ACS NSQIP program requires hospitals to track and analyze surgical outcomes for both inpatient and outpatient procedures, using a data-driven approach to identify areas for improvement and enhance patient safety initiatives. Dr. Eric Twerdahl, associate chair of Surgery for Quality and Outcomes at USU, explains that WRNMMC submits approximately 1,700 cases per year, which NSQIP then compares to the roughly 1 million cases it receives worldwide. Twerdahl describes it as a continuous benchmark of their performance, both amongst their peers in the Military Health System and internationally.

“Being able to compare our outcomes to other hospitals in the country is a tremendous value. And like in most MTFs, that’s where we shine,” he says, adding that at WRNMMC “you have a lower chance of having a complication after surgery than you do at about 90% of the hospitals in America.”

Despite recent infrastructure challenges, the data reflects what’s happening inside the hospital – the expertise, dedication, and resiliency of the USU-Walter Reed surgical team lead to exceptional results. Twerdahl emphasizes that “the credit goes to the individual surgeons, nurses, and surgical technicians,” underscoring that no matter the environment, “the resiliency of military surgeons is being able to get the job done effectively and safely.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-31 23:12:16.369242

Beneficiaries in all counties and boroughs are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through Jan. 5, 2026.

The original counties affected were Albany, Broome, Cayuga, Chenango, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Dutchess, Fulton, Greene, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery, Nassau, Oneida, Onondaga, Orange, Oswego, Otsego, Putnam, Rockland, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Suffolk, Rensselaer, Ulster, Wayne, and Westchester, as well as the boroughs of The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.

For beneficiaries in Essex County, the date has been extended from Dec. 30, 2025, to Jan. 5, 2026.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator at: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates at: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families.

“TFL provides Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B, regardless of their age or where they live,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency. “In the U.S. and U.S. territories, Medicare and TRICARE work together to minimize your out-of-pocket costs. If you get care overseas, TRICARE For Life becomes your primary coverage, unless you have other health insurance.”

When you move, you’ll need to update your address. You’ll also need to explore your options for getting care and filling prescriptions.

Updating your address

After you move, you need to update your address in a few places.

In the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System: Learn how to update your address in DEERS. You should also confirm that the rest of your DEERS record is correct.

With the Social Security Administration: Social Security maintains beneficiary records on behalf of Medicare. To update your address with Medicare, log in to your my Social Security account or call Social Security at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778).

With the TRICARE pharmacy contractor: Update your address with Express Scripts if you use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. You can do this by logging in to your Express Scripts account or calling Express Scripts.

Moving within or to the U.S. or U.S. territories

Medicare provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

If you have TFL and use Original Medicare (Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B), you can get care from Medicare participating and Medicare nonparticipating providers. You can find and compare Medicare providers in your new location.

You can also see providers who’ve opted out of Medicare. But keep in mind that Medicare doesn’t pay for services you get from opt-out providers. Learn more about getting care from Medicare providers and opt-out providers.

Are you enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan? If you move out of its service area, you’re eligible for a Medicare Special Enrollment Period. This means you’re eligible to enroll in a new Medicare Advantage Plan (Medicare Part C) and Medicare drug plan (Medicare Part D) or switch to Original Medicare. Learn more about Special Enrollment Periods.

If you have questions about Medicare, contact Medicare. In the U.S. and U.S. territories, WPS Government Services administers the TFL benefit. Contact WPS if you have questions about TFL.

Moving overseas

If you move overseas and you have Medicare Part A, you must also have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL. Even though Medicare doesn’t provide coverage outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, you must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums.

If you have TFL:

TRICARE is the primary payer for TRICARE-covered services and supplies, unless you have other health insurance.

You can get TRICARE-covered services and supplies from any TRICARE-authorized provider. (In the Philippines, you must get care from a Preferred Provider Network provider or a certified provider.)

If you get covered services from a network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will generally be lower than if you see a non-network provider. Search the overseas provider directory to find a network provider.

You’ll pay TRICARE cost-shares after you meet your TRICARE annual deductible.

You may need pre-authorization for some services.

International SOS is the TRICARE overseas contractor. Contact International SOS for help with finding providers, getting authorizations, filing claims, and more.

TRICARE Plus

Have you moved close to a military hospital or clinic? You may be able to enroll in TRICARE Plus. TRICARE Plus is a health care program offered at some military hospitals and clinics. Contact your local military hospital or clinic to see if they offer the program.

Note: You can’t enroll in TRICARE Plus if you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan health maintenance organization option.

Filling prescriptions

You may have different pharmacy options depending on where you move:

Military pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in some U.S. territories and some locations overseas. Find a military pharmacy near you.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery will ship to any address in the U.S. or U.S. territories. This includes APO, FPO, and DPO addresses. There are different rules for using home delivery in other overseas locations.

TRICARE retail network pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in most U.S. territories. Find a network pharmacy near you.

At non-network pharmacies, you’ll have to pay full price for your prescription drugs. Then you can file a claim for reimbursement. Overseas, a non-network pharmacy might be your only pharmacy option. In the Philippines, you must fill prescriptions at a certified pharmacy. Learn more about filling prescriptions overseas.

Your family members

When you have TFL, moving isn’t a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event for you. But moving is a QLE for family members who are enrolled in or eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. Your family members should also update their address in DEERS after they move. They’ll have 90 days from the date of the address change to change their TRICARE health plan.

TAMP Covers Some Veterans for 180 Days The Transitional Assistance Management Program gives 180 days of free Tricare coverage after active duty ends, but not everyone qualifies.
You get TAMP if you agree to join the Selected Reserve immediately after active duty with no gap in service.
Reservists Can Pay for Tricare If you're joining the Guard or reserve after active duty, you may qualify to purchase Tricare Reserve Select.
VA Health Care Is Not Automatic Separating from active duty doesn't automatically enroll you in VA health care.","You separate from active duty next month. Your Tricare Prime coverage ends. Now what?

Many service members don't sort this out until they're already out and scrambling for health insurance. The confusion costs money and creates gaps in coverage that leave families exposed.

Here's what actually happens with your health insurance when you leave active duty.

Terminal Leave Changes Nothing

While you're on terminal leave, you're still on active duty. Your Tricare Prime coverage continues exactly as it was. No changes, no action required. Don't confuse terminal leave with separation. You separate when your official end of active service date hits, not when you start terminal leave.

Your family stays covered under their current plan during terminal leave, too: Tricare Prime, Tricare Select -- whatever they had before terminal leave started.

TAMP Covers Some Veterans for 180 Days

The Transitional Assistance Management Program gives 180 days of free Tricare coverage after active duty ends, but not everyone qualifies.

You get TAMP if you separate involuntarily under honorable conditions. That includes service members who take voluntary separation pay but can't receive retirement pay. National Guard and reserve members who served more than 30 consecutive days supporting a contingency operation also qualify.

You get TAMP if you were stop-lossed and then separated. You get TAMP if you agree to join the Selected Reserve immediately after active duty with no gap in service.

Check your eligibility in milConnect or talk to your personnel office before you separate. TAMP starts the day after your active duty ends. Your family gets covered, too.

During TAMP, you keep Tricare Select coverage: no premiums, same network, same rules. Prescription coverage continues. If you qualified for active-duty dental benefits, those continue under TAMP.

TAMP ends after 180 days, so on day 181, you're on your own unless you’ve arranged other coverage.

CHCBP Costs Money

The Continued Health Care Benefit Program is Tricare coverage you purchase after TAMP ends or after separation if you don't qualify for TAMP. Coverage lasts 18 to 36 months depending on your situation.

CHCBP gives you the same coverage as Tricare Select: network providers, prescriptions -- the works. But you pay quarterly premiums. For 2025, member-only coverage costs $1,849 per quarter. Family coverage runs $4,621 per quarter.

That's $7,396 per year for individual coverage or $18,484 for family coverage. Compare that to marketplace plans or employer insurance before you sign up.

You must enroll within 60 days of losing Tricare or TAMP coverage. Miss that window, and you can't get CHCBP. The contractor is Humana Military.

Reservists Can Pay for Tricare

If you're joining the Guard or reserve after active duty, you may qualify to purchase Tricare Reserve Select. Monthly premiums for 2025 are $53.80 for member-only coverage or $274.48 for family coverage.

TRS follows Tricare Select rules: same network, same coverage. You pay the monthly premium plus copays and deductibles when you use care.

TRS beats CHCBP on cost: $645.60 per year for individual TRS coverage versus $7,396 for CHCBP individual coverage. If you qualify for TRS, take it.

VA Health Care Is Not Automatic

Separating from active duty doesn't automatically enroll you in VA health care. You have to apply. You can apply as soon as you get your separation orders, but coverage doesn't start until after you separate.

VA health care eligibility depends on your service history, disability rating, income and other factors. Not everyone qualifies for full VA coverage.

The VA Concierge for Care team calls recently separated veterans to help with enrollment. They'll process your application over the phone and schedule your first appointment.

VA health care covers service-connected disabilities. It may cover other care depending on your priority group. But VA coverage alone might not replace Tricare for your family. Spouses and kids generally don't qualify for VA health care.

Don't Let Coverage Lapse

Figure out your health insurance before you separate: TAMP if you qualify; CHCBP or TRS if you don't; employer insurance from your new civilian job; or Health Insurance Marketplace plans if nothing else works.

Gaps in coverage cost thousands when someone gets hurt or sick. Know what you have, when it ends, and what comes next

When veterans transition from active military service to civilian life, many choose to continue their careers in federal government roles. The unique combination of military and federal employment presents an opportunity for veterans to significantly bolster their retirement benefits through a lesser-known yet powerful option: the TriCARE buyback program. This program allows veterans who become federal employees to “buy back” their military service time, counting it toward their federal retirement. This process can reshape their retirement prospects, blending military and federal service into a seamless financial future.

The Basics of Military Buyback: A Hidden Advantage

Military buyback is a little-discussed but invaluable option for veterans who move into federal employment. By purchasing their military service time and adding it to their civilian federal retirement system, veterans can potentially retire earlier and with a higher pension. The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) both allow veterans to utilize this benefit, but the key difference lies in how it enhances the veteran’s pension.

Here’s how it works: Veterans who served in active duty have the option to make a one-time payment to “buy back” their years of military service. This payment, often referred to as a military deposit, is based on the amount of basic military pay the veteran received during their years of service, plus a small interest fee if not paid within a set time frame. Once completed, these years of service are credited toward the veteran’s federal retirement, just as if they had worked those years in the federal government.

How TriCARE Buyback Programs Fit into the Federal Retirement Picture

The significance of this buyback lies in how it improves both the veteran’s pension and healthcare benefits. By leveraging TriCARE buyback, federal employees can significantly enhance their overall retirement package. This isn’t just about pensions—it’s about healthcare security and maximizing long-term benefits.

Veterans who are eligible for TriCARE, the Department of Defense’s health insurance program for military personnel, retirees, and their families, may have the opportunity to coordinate their healthcare benefits with their federal civilian benefits. For example, while TriCARE provides ongoing healthcare coverage, federal retirees also have access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. A veteran who buys back military time and retires from the federal workforce may be able to combine the best of both worlds—TriCARE and FEHB—ensuring robust healthcare coverage throughout their retirement.

In addition, veterans can further strengthen their financial security by combining their military buyback with Social Security benefits. While veterans who served under FERS contribute to Social Security, those under CSRS may not. Nonetheless, a military buyback allows veterans under either system to potentially qualify for or increase their Social Security benefits by adding their years of military service to their civilian employment record.

The Financial Impact of TriCARE Buyback

The financial implications of opting for a TriCARE buyback are substantial. The cost to buy back military service is generally affordable, especially compared to the long-term retirement benefits it yields. For many veterans, the amount paid for a military deposit is far outweighed by the increase in pension they will receive.

For example, under FERS, veterans earn 1% of their high-3 average salary for each year of service, or 1.1% if they retire at age 62 or older with 20 years of service. A veteran who buys back four years of military service could significantly increase their retirement income by thousands of dollars annually. This additional income continues for life, meaning the buyback option pays dividends for decades to come.

The buyback also influences retirement eligibility. Typically, federal employees need at least five years of service to qualify for retirement benefits under FERS or CSRS. Veterans who buy back their military time can use those years to reach eligibility faster, potentially shaving years off their time in the workforce and allowing for an earlier retirement.

Eligibility and Timing: A Key Consideration

Timing is critical when it comes to the TriCARE buyback option. Veterans must initiate the buyback process before they retire from federal service, and ideally, they should do so as soon as they enter the civilian workforce. The cost of the buyback increases over time due to the accumulation of interest. Veterans who make their deposit within three years of becoming federal employees can avoid interest entirely. After that, interest begins to accrue on the military deposit, raising the overall cost.

The buyback process involves several steps, starting with obtaining military service records (typically DD Form 214) and working with the federal agency’s human resources office to calculate the amount of the military deposit. Once the deposit is calculated and paid, the service time is credited toward retirement. This process can take time, so starting early ensures that veterans maximize their buyback benefits and avoid unnecessary delays.

TriCARE Buyback and Federal Pensions: A Win-Win Scenario

For veterans weighing the pros and cons of a TriCARE buyback, the decision largely hinges on their long-term retirement goals. By increasing their federal pension, shortening their time to retirement eligibility, and potentially boosting their Social Security benefits, the buyback program offers veterans a significant return on investment.

One of the primary benefits of military buyback is its versatility. Veterans under both FERS and CSRS can utilize the program, though the mechanics differ slightly. FERS employees benefit from a three-part retirement package: a civil service pension, Social Security, and TSP (Thrift Savings Plan) contributions. Buying back military time means a higher pension and earlier retirement, both of which offer a substantial financial advantage. CSRS employees, who do not receive Social Security as part of their retirement, still benefit from an increased pension, making the buyback a valuable option.

Ultimately, the buyback program is designed to reward veterans for their military service by providing an opportunity to maximize the retirement benefits available to them as federal employees. By taking advantage of this program, veterans can ensure that their time in uniform continues to serve them long after they transition to civilian life.

Why TriCARE Buyback Programs Are a Game-Changer for Veterans

The TriCARE buyback option is more than just a financial tool—it’s a pathway to retirement security for veterans. The ability to count military service toward federal retirement offers veterans a distinct advantage over their civilian counterparts. In addition to increasing pension benefits, the buyback helps veterans navigate healthcare options, blending TriCARE and FEHB coverage for comprehensive, cost-effective health benefits.

For veterans under FERS, the buyback also has the added advantage of enhancing Social Security benefits. Military service, when combined with civilian federal service, can boost the number of credits veterans need to qualify for Social Security or increase the amount of their monthly benefit. This can make a significant difference in a veteran’s overall retirement income, particularly if they plan to retire early or have a gap between their federal retirement and when they become eligible for Social Security.

Veterans considering a buyback should weigh the long-term benefits carefully. The process requires an upfront financial investment, but for many veterans, the return on that investment is substantial. By adding valuable years of service to their federal retirement calculation, veterans can retire with more money in their pockets and greater peace of mind about their financial future.

Maximizing Your Federal Retirement with TriCARE Buyback

For veterans who have served their country and continue to serve the federal government, the TriCARE buyback program offers a powerful tool to enhance their retirement. By purchasing their military service time and crediting it toward their federal retirement, veterans can retire earlier, increase their pension, and coordinate healthcare benefits for a more secure future.",https://psretirement.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-1728025669.png,N,1.0,2025-12-31 11:11:53.991011

Military families get accustomed to this pattern: You plan and the United States Armed Forces makes you go back to the drawing board.

Inconveniently, he had pre-deployment work travel pop up while I was ovulating, which is how we found ourselves explaining to the staff at a local fertility clinic that we needed to freeze my husband’s sperm so I could do an intrauterine insemination while he was away.

It was incredibly stressful. It was like the clinic had never dealt with a couple in our situation. We didn’t have fertility issues that we were aware of, but I was 37 and it felt like we didn’t have a month to waste. One staff member tried to charge us for a full IVF cycle, at a cost of at least $10,000. Ultimately, after a negotiation, we were able to get the job done a la carte for several hundred dollars.

The IUI didn’t work. Maybe I do have fertility issues, I thought. I wasn’t exactly young for having children.

I remember thinking how I wished I hadn’t switched to my husband’s military insurance, TRICARE. It covered only fertility issues related to “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.” My employer-provided insurance did, though it was more expensive but significantly cheaper than paying for IVF out of pocket.

I should note that having the choice of two insurance options is something many military spouses do not have. My husband was at the end of his military career, and his home base was stationary. The constant moves that usually define military life wreak havoc on a military spouse finding a job, let alone maintaining a career. Military spouses have an unemployment rate four to five times the national average. TRICARE is often their only choice for medical coverage.

More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn’t offer fertility coverage. A couple of weeks ago, it really looked like it would, which is why as we ring in 2026, I am thinking of the military families struggling to have a baby, for whom this new year will be off to a bitter start.

They were banking on a provision in the massive defense bill signed into law by President Donald Trump just before the holidays that would have given them the same kind of access to fertility coverage that other federal employees have.

The IVF language easily passed out of committees in the House and Senate. But as the bill was buffed and polished into a final version for both chambers to pass and send to Trump’s desk, the IVF provision was stripped from the measure just days before a vote.

It was devastating for military family members like Courtney Deady and her husband, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard, who have been trying to have a baby for a decade.

They’ve spent $100,000 on multiple attempts to conceive by intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.

“It’s the mental health, it’s the travel,” Deady said. “There’s so many other things, such as cryopreservation” of embryos.

Deady has one embryo left for one last round of IVF.

She was counting on the fertility coverage in the defense bill. It seemed like it had a real shot. After all, Trump campaigned on making IVF more accessible, and this was the first National Defense Authorization Act he would sign after he reentered the White House.

Broken campaign promise

On the trail in 2024, Trump had pledged that “under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.”

Deady voted for Trump, sold on his IVF promises.

She was buoyed by the executive order he signed in February to ease the financial burdens of fertility treatment and deflated when he signed a defense bill this month that did nothing to ease the financial burdens of IVF for military families.

“It honestly feels, for lack of better terms, more of a slap in the face to a lot of our community when our Congress is receiving a lot of those benefits that we so desperately would love to have on our end,” she told CNN.

Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat wounded veteran who battled infertility and ultimately conceived two children through IVF, was the Senate sponsor of the TRICARE coverage provision.

Duckworth blames House Speaker Mike Johnson for removing it last minute from the bill.

“The committees in both chambers support this. There’s nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“The president of the United States … promised on the campaign trail to make IVF available to all Americans, and I can’t think of a better place to make it available than to the men and women of this great nation,” the Illinois Democrat said.

Duckworth sent a letter to Trump with a handwritten note: “Speaker Johnson wants you to become the deadbeat dad of IVF,” a reference to Trump’s description of himself as “the father of IVF.”

Johnson’s home state of Louisiana has some of the most restrictive laws in the country governing IVF, emblematic of the influence of anti-abortion activists in the state.

Louisiana is the only state to prohibit patients and clinics from disposing of unused embryos, requiring they be shipped out of state.

A spokesperson for Johnson’s office told CNN that expanding access to IVF remains a priority.

“President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF. The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” they said in a statement.

Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.

“When we’ve — all of our families — have really thought logically and we’ve prayed about it or we’ve done the research to figure out what, ethically, this journey looks like for us and to not have that, it goes to show that there’s a … lack of education when it comes to this realm of reproductive medicine,” she told CNN.

There was bipartisan disappointment in the last-minute yanking of the IVF provision and, in the House, a group of veterans and lawmakers representing significant military communities has already reintroduced IVF coverage in TRICARE.

Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a Navy veteran, is among them.

“Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” he said in a statement.

Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation. Access to IVF and fertility care shouldn’t depend on financial means.”

A sacrifice families shouldn’t have to make

I am writing this column with my 7-year-old son fast asleep in his bed, counting my blessings that my failed IUI was my one and only fertility treatment.

After it, my husband returned home from his work trip but deployed before I expected to ovulate again. So, when I realized I was pregnant long after he deployed, it felt like a miracle, especially when my first sonogram showed I was pregnant with twins.

A few weeks after, another sonogram showed I had what’s called “a vanishing twin.” The second embryo had failed to develop. But there was still one. We made it through a large subchorionic hemorrhage of my placenta and a few other difficult moments, including my water breaking a month early while my husband was in Asia on a graduation trip for his eldest child not long after returning from his deployment. Somehow, he made it back for the final minutes of my labor to see our son born.

Not even a year later, my husband deployed again, for longer this time. Military family life was a lot for me to manage, caring for a baby and my young stepson as well, but I can’t imagine not having the chance. Being a military spouse has been one of the best experiences of my life, but nothing surpasses being a mom.

For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn’t have to make.

Ellie Mental Health Faces ‘Substantial Doubt’ Regarding Its Survival ​Ellie Mental Health has been a pioneer in rolling out a franchise model for behavioral health practices.","This is an exclusive BHB+ article

While federal policy shifts dominated 2025 headlines, several quieter stories revealed significant industry transformations happening beneath the surface.

​Many stories exposed critical failures in today’s behavioral health system—from TRICARE’s technical glitches disrupting autism care for military families to Ellie Mental Health’s troubled franchise model.

Yet amid these challenges, promising developments emerged: new opportunities to integrate mental health into maternal care and the advancement of innovative reimbursement models, such as population health approaches.

Every year, as editor of Behavioral Health Business, I go through our archives and look for some of the most under-the-radar stories of the year.

In this BHB+ Update, I will explore:

–Why value-based care could be just the start for new reimbursement models

–What investors are now expecting from mental health startups

–The potential opportunity for maternal mental health integration

Disastrous Tech Failures Clobber Autism Therapy Providers in TRICARE West Region

Early last year, BHB’s Chris Larson reported that a technology issue prevented autism providers in the TRICARE West network from checking member eligibility, submitting or checking prior authorizations, or processing claims.

This meant that autism providers caring for military families went weeks without getting paid for services.

​In turn, this triggered many autism providers to limit or stop services to TRICARE beneficiaries.

​This story was the first story about TRICARE issues, but not the last of the year. In April, we reported that autism providers across the nation were impacted by glitches that impacted the transition of the TRICARE regional contracts at the beginning of the year. In addition to providers in TRIWest, the eastern TRICARE contractor, Humana Military, began to disclose similar administrative problems.

​For months at a time, technology systems didn’t work as promised and payments were not made. This story was important because it meant that providers had to make a difficult decision to continue to serve active military families without a solid payment pathway or cut off vulnerable children from services.

Digital Mental Health Startups Face Profitability Pressure as Investor Landscape Shifts

​In 2021 and 2022, venture capital investors poured billions of dollars into the behavioral health sector. In many ways, this was a huge positive for behavioral health services, where consumers often faced access issues.

​However, with so much competition in the market, investors are now raising their expectations of these digital providers. One of the biggest factors investors are now looking for before providing new backing to startups is profitability.

​“[Profitability is] top of mind more than ever,” Faye Sahai, managing partner of Exbourne Group and founding managing general partner at Telosity Ventures, told Behavioral Health Business for the story. “Several years ago, it was really about the interest, the idea, the momentum, the growth. Now we’re in a market that is really looking at your revenue, your unit cost, net profit, how much you plan to grow.”

Redwood City, California-based venture capital firm Telosity invests in pre-seed, Seed, and Series A-stage startups focused on youth mental health and well-being.

​Digital behavioral health companies are, in many ways, at a crossroads. Many have reached profitability and are growing their service line. However, others are bleeding capital and looking to reinvent themselves.

​This story examines what providers need to do to attract investor interest and stay afloat in a competitive market.

Population Health Management Could Be the Next Frontier for Behavioral Health Reimbursement

We write a lot about the evolution of payment from fee-for-service to value-based care models at BHB. But that may be just the first step for emerging reimbursement models.

​Population health management, often called by payers value-based purchasing, could be the next evolution of payment models. This type of reimbursement is aimed at identifying populations with unmet clinical needs and then providing care pathways to accelerate recovery.

​Unlike traditional reimbursement models, population health management oversees a cohort of patients at the population level. This could include different geographic populations, employee groups, ethnic groups, people with disabilities, or other defined groups.

​This was an important story to tell because we often think of value-based contracting as the one path forward. Yet, value-based care could be just the start for new models of reimbursement.

‘Like Going to the Dentist’: The Business Case for Maternal Mental Health

As integrated care becomes central to behavioral health services, maternal mental health has emerged as a natural opportunity for integration.

There is a major need for services for this population. One in 7 new mothers experiences postpartum depression, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Still, there are barriers to care. For example, the story outlines that there are a few specialized experts in the space.

“There’s a limited number of reproductive or perinatal psychiatrists with specialized expertise and experience caring for women during pregnancy and postpartum,” Dr. Rachel Dalthorp, executive medical director of specialty services at LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST), told BHB. “Some mental health providers are less familiar with prescribing medications in these periods.”

And while awareness around maternal mental health conditions is growing, there are still places to expand OB involvement and referrals.

“Simplified referral processes and collaborative care models can help reduce delays and improve timely access to mental health care,” Dalthorp said. “Payment models, including bundled payments for perinatal OB care, can make it difficult for OBs to be fairly reimbursed for the time they spend supporting moms’ mental health. Separate physical and behavioral health benefits add complexity for clinicians and patients.”

Better integration of mental health into maternity services could serve as a model for future specialty integrations.

Ellie Mental Health Faces ‘Substantial Doubt’ Regarding Its Survival

​Ellie Mental Health has been a pioneer in rolling out a franchise model for behavioral health practices. The BHB team has been closely watching the company because, if successful, it could be a new model for clinicians interested in becoming business owners.

​However, this article revealed that the company is now facing a wave of backlash from its franchises, who claimed it misrepresented the requirements and support they would receive. What’s more, several business owners told BHB that this has left them on the edge of financial ruin.

​Specifically, some franchisees claim that Ellie’s back-end support services are glitchy and slow, inhibiting revenue generation and collection. Several franchisees are now trying to break away from the parent company and have taken Ellie to court arbitration.

​Ellie has, in turn, also taken legal action against the franchisees who have attempted to separate their clinics from the parent company.

​While Ellie and the franchise continue to battle in court, public records demonstrate Ellie faces its own host of financial challenges. In August, Ellie updated its franchise disclosure document (FDD), stating that it faces the likelihood of failure.

​The story is important because it calls into question the viability of the franchise model in behavioral health.",https://bhbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/12/pexels-jeshoots-com-147458-451590-1-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-30 12:56:34.036682

More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn’t offer fertility coverage.
Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.
Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation.
For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn’t have to make.","Back in 2017, when my husband was still in the Army, we learned he was unexpectedly deploying right as we were going to start trying to get pregnant. Military families get accustomed to this pattern: You plan and the United States Armed Forces makes you go back to the drawing board.

Inconveniently, he had pre-deployment work travel pop up while I was ovulating, which is how we found ourselves explaining to the staff at a local fertility clinic that we needed to freeze my husband’s sperm so I could do an intrauterine insemination while he was away.

It was incredibly stressful. It was like the clinic had never dealt with a couple in our situation. We didn’t have fertility issues that we were aware of, but I was 37 and it felt like we didn’t have a month to waste. One staff member tried to charge us for a full IVF cycle, at a cost of at least $10,000. Ultimately, after a negotiation, we were able to get the job done a la carte for several hundred dollars.

The IUI didn’t work. Maybe I do have fertility issues, I thought. I wasn’t exactly young for having children.

I remember thinking how I wished I hadn’t switched to my husband’s military insurance, TRICARE. It covered only fertility issues related to “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.” My employer-provided insurance did, though it was more expensive but significantly cheaper than paying for IVF out of pocket.

I should note that having the choice of two insurance options is something many military spouses do not have. My husband was at the end of his military career, and his home base was stationary. The constant moves that usually define military life wreak havoc on a military spouse finding a job, let alone maintaining a career. Military spouses have an unemployment rate four to five times the national average. TRICARE is often their only choice for medical coverage.

More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn’t offer fertility coverage. A couple of weeks ago, it really looked like it would, which is why as we ring in 2026, I am thinking of the military families struggling to have a baby, for whom this new year will be off to a bitter start.

They were banking on a provision in the massive defense bill signed into law by President Donald Trump just before the holidays that would have given them the same kind of access to fertility coverage that other federal employees have.

The IVF language easily passed out of committees in the House and Senate. But as the bill was buffed and polished into a final version for both chambers to pass and send to Trump’s desk, the IVF provision was stripped from the measure just days before a vote.

It was devastating for military family members like Courtney Deady and her husband, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard, who have been trying to have a baby for a decade.

They’ve spent $100,000 on multiple attempts to conceive by intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.

“It’s the mental health, it’s the travel,” Deady said. “There’s so many other things, such as cryopreservation” of embryos.

Deady has one embryo left for one last round of IVF.

She was counting on the fertility coverage in the defense bill. It seemed like it had a real shot. After all, Trump campaigned on making IVF more accessible, and this was the first National Defense Authorization Act he would sign after he reentered the White House.

Broken campaign promise

On the trail in 2024, Trump had pledged that “under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.”

Deady voted for Trump, sold on his IVF promises.

She was buoyed by the executive order he signed in February to ease the financial burdens of fertility treatment and deflated when he signed a defense bill this month that did nothing to ease the financial burdens of IVF for military families.

“It honestly feels, for lack of better terms, more of a slap in the face to a lot of our community when our Congress is receiving a lot of those benefits that we so desperately would love to have on our end,” she told CNN.

Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat wounded veteran who battled infertility and ultimately conceived two children through IVF, was the Senate sponsor of the TRICARE coverage provision.

Duckworth blames House Speaker Mike Johnson for removing it last minute from the bill.

“The committees in both chambers support this. There’s nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“The president of the United States … promised on the campaign trail to make IVF available to all Americans, and I can’t think of a better place to make it available than to the men and women of this great nation,” the Illinois Democrat said.

Duckworth sent a letter to Trump with a handwritten note: “Speaker Johnson wants you to become the deadbeat dad of IVF,” a reference to Trump’s description of himself as “the father of IVF.”

Johnson’s home state of Louisiana has some of the most restrictive laws in the country governing IVF, emblematic of the influence of anti-abortion activists in the state.

Louisiana is the only state to prohibit patients and clinics from disposing of unused embryos, requiring they be shipped out of state.

A spokesperson for Johnson’s office told CNN that expanding access to IVF remains a priority.

“President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF. The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” they said in a statement.

Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.

“When we’ve — all of our families — have really thought logically and we’ve prayed about it or we’ve done the research to figure out what, ethically, this journey looks like for us and to not have that, it goes to show that there’s a … lack of education when it comes to this realm of reproductive medicine,” she told CNN.

There was bipartisan disappointment in the last-minute yanking of the IVF provision and, in the House, a group of veterans and lawmakers representing significant military communities has already reintroduced IVF coverage in TRICARE.

Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a Navy veteran, is among them.

“Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” he said in a statement.

Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation. Access to IVF and fertility care shouldn’t depend on financial means.”

A sacrifice families shouldn’t have to make

I am writing this column with my 7-year-old son fast asleep in his bed, counting my blessings that my failed IUI was my one and only fertility treatment.

After it, my husband returned home from his work trip but deployed before I expected to ovulate again. So, when I realized I was pregnant long after he deployed, it felt like a miracle, especially when my first sonogram showed I was pregnant with twins.

A few weeks after, another sonogram showed I had what’s called “a vanishing twin.” The second embryo had failed to develop. But there was still one. We made it through a large subchorionic hemorrhage of my placenta and a few other difficult moments, including my water breaking a month early while my husband was in Asia on a graduation trip for his eldest child not long after returning from his deployment. Somehow, he made it back for the final minutes of my labor to see our son born.

Not even a year later, my husband deployed again, for longer this time. Military family life was a lot for me to manage, caring for a baby and my young stepson as well, but I can’t imagine not having the chance. Being a military spouse has been one of the best experiences of my life, but nothing surpasses being a mom.

For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn’t have to make.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1307251716-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,-1.0,2025-12-30 12:56:38.825644

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX – Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

Despite the challenges of military life, becoming a mother remains the most fulfilling aspect of her life.
However, she recognizes that many military families lack that opportunity, and the gap in fertility coverage continues to be a pressing concern.","In a poignant reflection on military life and reproductive challenges, a woman recounts her journey through infertility amidst her husband’s unexpected Army deployment in 2017. As they prepared to start a family, the couple faced the harsh reality of military scheduling, which forced them to adjust their plans at the last minute. During her ovulation cycle, her husband was called away for pre-deployment work travel, necessitating a visit to a fertility clinic to freeze his sperm for an intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedure.

The experience at the clinic was fraught with stress and confusion, as it appeared they were navigating uncharted territory. Although there were no known fertility issues, the woman’s age—37 at the time—weighed heavily on their minds, prompting a hurry to start treatment. Financial challenges compounded their situation, as she learned that her husband’s military insurance, TRICARE, offered minimal support for fertility treatments, only covering issues related to military service injuries or illnesses. A negotiation allowed them to afford the sperm freezing procedure a la carte, but their subsequent IUI attempt ultimately did not yield a pregnancy.

Fast forward over eight years, and the woman’s longing for comprehensive fertility support is echoed by military families across the country. While federal employees’ fertility benefits have expanded significantly in recent years, TRICARE’s limitations remain unaddressed. Many military families, grappling with infertility, had pinned their hopes on a recent defense bill that was believed to include provisions for fertility coverage. As 2026 approached, a sense of disappointment engulfed these families when they learned that the IVF support language had been stripped from the bill just before its passage.

The emotional toll is evident in stories like that of Courtney Deady, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard’s family. Deady and her husband have invested over $100,000 into multiple fertility treatments without success. She describes the mental strain associated with the process, noting that the loss of financial support from the defense bill felt like a betrayal, particularly given a prior promise from former President Trump to address IVF accessibility. Deady, who formerly supported Trump based on his commitment to fertility treatment reimbursement, was left feeling disillusioned by the recent developments.

Additionally, Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran and an advocate for fertility treatment access, has placed blame on House Speaker Mike Johnson for the last-minute removal of the IVF provision. Duckworth argues that the support for this measure had bipartisan backing, indicating a strong desire for change amidst Congress. The disparity between the benefits available to Congress members and military families adds another layer of frustration for those navigating this difficult journey.

Within the military community, leaders like Republican Representatives Nick LaLota and Jennifer Kiggans are advocating for better access to fertility treatments, emphasizing that military families should not sacrifice essential needs for financial reasons. Their statements underscore a collective understanding that without improved reproductive health coverage, many military families will continue to face challenges in building the families they desire.

As the woman reminisces about her own fertility journey, which ultimately led her to become a mother of twins, she acknowledges the privilege of her specific circumstances. Despite the challenges of military life, becoming a mother remains the most fulfilling aspect of her life. However, she recognizes that many military families lack that opportunity, and the gap in fertility coverage continues to be a pressing concern.

December brought with it a season of joy, reflection and connection across our aged care residences. From festive decorations to heartfelt moments shared between residents, families and staff, the past month was filled with celebrations that truly captured the spirit of the Holiday Season.

Festive Decorations & Christmas Cheer

Our age care residences were transformed into festive wonderlands, with Christmas trees proudly displayed, halls adorned with twinkling lights, and residents helping to decorate their spaces. Many enjoyed reminiscing as they hung ornaments, sparking conversations about Christmas past and creating new memories together.

Parties & Special Celebrations

Each aged care residence hosted its own Christmas celebrations, complete with festive music, themed activities and plenty of laughter. Residents dressed up for the occasion, enjoyed singalongs and joined in Christmas trivia and games. These events were a highlight of the month, bringing everyone together in a joyful and relaxed atmosphere.

Delicious Festive Feasts

The holidays wouldn’t be complete without good food, and our residents were treated to special festive menus prepared by our wonderful chefs and hospitality teams. Traditional Christmas lunches, decadent desserts and afternoon teas were enjoyed with friends, family members and staff, making mealtimes extra special throughout December.

Music, Carols & Community Visits

The sound of Christmas filled our homes as residents enjoyed live performances, carol singing and visits from local community groups. These moments brought smiles, stirred memories and created a beautiful sense of togetherness, reminding us all how powerful music can be.

Time with Loved Ones

One of the most meaningful parts of the festive season was seeing families and friends visit to celebrate with their loved ones. Whether it was sharing a meal, taking photos by the Christmas tree or simply spending quiet time together, these moments were deeply cherished by residents and staff alike.

Thank You to Our Incredible Team

We would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our dedicated staff who worked tirelessly throughout the festive season. Their care, compassion and commitment ensured that every resident felt supported, celebrated and included during this special time of year.",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/12/chris2-1-e1767068414629.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-30 10:56:27.456257

In the heart of TriCare’s Compton Gardens Bustling Retirement Village on the northside of Brisbane in Aspley, there’s a gentle hum of connection that has been growing stronger over the past three years. At the centre of it all is Leonie, the Lifestyle Activities Coordinator whose journey from kindergarten teacher to retirement community activity leader has been nothing short of inspiring.

From Classrooms to Community

Leonie spent many years guiding little ones through their first steps in learning, nurturing curiosity and joy in the classroom. When she transitioned into her role at the Compton Gardens Retirement Village, she carried with her the same passion for fostering relationships and creating spaces where people feel seen, valued, and loved.

A Program Born of Compassion

Recognising that many residents had little or no family nearby, Leonie introduced a program that would bring together two groups often in need of connection: retirees and local mothers. Every fortnight, mothers from the community – some traveling up to 40 minutes – arrive at the Compton Gardens Retirement Living Village with their children to share time, stories, and laughter with the residents.

Residents who might otherwise feel isolated find companionship and joy.

Mothers, many with families overseas or interstate, discover a supportive network.

Children bring energy and innocence that light up the room.

Leonie spreads the word through adverts in local community papers, ensuring that the program remains open and welcoming to newcomers. Over time, a group of regulars has formed, creating bonds that feel like extended family including some catching up on weekends or other times at birthday parties and so on.

The Magic of Nursery Rhymes

Ask anyone what their favourite part of the gathering is, and the answer is unanimous: the singing of nursery rhymes! Voices young and old blend together in familiar tunes, sparking memories for residents and delight for children. For Leonie, this moment is the heartbeat of the program, a reminder that music transcends age, distance, and circumstance.

The room fills with laughter when a child forgets a line, or when a resident adds a playful twist to a familiar song. It’s not just singing; it’s storytelling, learning, memory-sharing, and pure joy wrapped into one.

More Than Just a Program

What Leonie has created is more than a scheduled activity. It’s a lifeline of support, a bridge between generations, and a testament to the power of community. Residents who once felt the ache of distance from loved ones now look forward to these fortnightly visits. Mothers who once felt alone in their parenting journey now know they have friends who care.

And through it all, Leonie stands quietly at the centre, organising, encouraging, and smiling as she watches bonds form and grow. Her favourite saying is ‘we are all young at heart!’",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/12/Compton-Gardens-resident-Monica-Armstrong-loves-spending-time-with-seven-month-old-Alex-Longton.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-30 16:11:53.832572
