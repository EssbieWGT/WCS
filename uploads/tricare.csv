Congresswoman Nancy Mace has reintroduced the Childhood Genital Mutilation Prevention Bill on Sept. 26, 2025 - a bill that would make certain gender-related medical treatments for minors a federal crime, bar federal funding and Medicare payments for them, and exclude providers who perform those treatments from Medicare participation. The measure also follows Rep. Mace’s separate push to strip TRICARE, the military’s health plan, of coverage for gender-transition care through an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2026 NDAA. Supporters say the bill makes permanent protections first ordered by President Trump; opponents warn it could criminalize medical care and prompt immediate legal fights.

What the bill would do

At its core, the bill does three things in federal law: It creates a new federal criminal offense for knowingly performing gender-related medical treatment on a minor (punishable by fines or up to 10 years in prison) It amends Medicare law to bar payment and to remove participating providers who perform such treatments It bans use of any federal funds for gender-related medical treatment of minors or for health plans that cover those services.

Understanding nuances

The bill lists specific medical actions it treats as “gender-related medical treatment” for minors: examples include puberty blockers, exogenous cross-sex hormones, and an array of surgical procedures such as mastectomy/subcutaneous mastectomy, vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, orchiectomy, hysterectomy and others. Further, it defines what constitutes as a “minor”. It says that any individual under 18 years of age is a minor, and defines “sex” and “gender” in biological and social terms for the statute’s purposes. Those definitions determine the scope of the criminal and funding bans.

Exceptions the bill allows — narrow medical necessity carve-outs

The bill includes limited exceptions. A provider is not guilty under the criminal provision if the treatment is for a diagnosed disorder of sex development (DSD) demonstrated by genetic or biochemical testing, for irresolvably ambiguous biological sex characteristics, or to treat an infection, injury, disease or disorder caused or worsened by prior gender-related medical treatment. The bill also clarifies that a minor who seeks or receives such treatment is not criminally liable. Those exceptions are narrow and tied to defined medical conditions. Separately, the bill amends the Social Security Act to add gender-related medical treatment for minors to Medicare’s list of non-covered services and directs the Secretary to terminate enrollment of any provider who furnishes such treatments after a 90-day transition period.

Source: X/Nancy Mace

It also includes a broader prohibition: no federal funds (including trust funds) may be obligated or expended for gender-related medical treatment for minors or for health benefits that include such coverage. In short: the statute targets payment streams and program participation as well as the conduct itself.

How this links to other federal steps

Congresswoman Mace frames the bill as a legislative follow-up to President Trump’s January 2025 executive order, Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, which directed agencies to limit federal funding for certain gender-affirming services to people under 19. Mace has also filed NDAA amendments that would prohibit TRICARE from covering gender-transition care for service members and dependents - an attempt to extend the funding ban into DoD health benefits through defense legislation. Those actions are explicitly presented as complementary: executive action for immediate policy and a statute for permanence. A reintroduced bill must be referred to committee, debated, and passed by both chambers before reaching the President’s desk. While, even if the bill advances in committee, the combination of political controversy and likely litigation means any enforcement or funding changes could be tied up in courts for months or years.

However, this time the message has brought calm and good news for many families. The recent communication about Medicare and the Tricare program has brought a smile to more than one person.

The interest is significant because it affects a very specific group of citizens. These are active-duty military members, retirees, and also their immediate family members. SSA's announcement aims to clarify how they should act to access the health coverage they are entitled to.

An advance that clarifies questions for Americans: advantages of accessing Tricare

Social Security has reminded people that those who meet Medicare requirements can coordinate their coverage with Tricare. This special program offers easy access to doctors, hospitals, and treatments. The combination of both services ensures solid support in medical care.

Tricare covers several categories of people. Active-duty military members, retirees, family members, and also members of the National Guard and Reservists are included. All of them have benefits that expand if Medicare Parts A and B are activated correctly.

SSA's message insists that enrollment is key. In order to enjoy Tricare For Life, beneficiaries must have both of those Medicare parts active. Otherwise, they would lose a highly valued health support in the United States.

How to enroll and what to know before doing so

Enrollment is not complicated, but it does require attention. SSA explains that people must be officially enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. Once this is done, the Tricare program is activated automatically for those who meet the requirements.

The process aims to ensure that beneficiaries do not have gaps in their coverage. Coordination between Medicare and Tricare prevents unnecessary expenses and makes medical care easier. Program clients greatly value that peace of mind, especially during delicate health moments.

The opinions of those enrolled are very positive. Many highlight that the combination of Medicare and Tricare gives them financial and medical security. Others emphasize that it is a real relief to know that their families will be protected without complicated procedures.

SSA sums up its message in a simple idea: take advantage of what is already available. Enrolling on time in the correct Medicare parts opens the door to a huge benefit like Tricare For Life. That's why thousands of people in the United States have received the news with euphoria and gratitude.",https://catalunyadiari.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/montaje-bandera-estados-unidos-jubilados_1200_800.webp,N,1.0,2025-09-28 06:56:23.695428

“TRICARE covers National Guard and Reserve members injured while in qualified duty status (under 30 days) through line of duty care,” said James Whitton, Chief, Military Medical Support Office at the Defense Health Agency. “LOD care covers treatment of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty if a LOD determination is approved.”

This article explores how, where, and under what circumstances National Guard and Reserve members can get LOD care.

How Does LOD care work?

If a National Guard or Reserve member is injured or becomes ill while on qualified duty status for 30 days or less, treatment may qualify under LOD care. This includes injury, illness, or disease that’s incurred or aggravated while on qualified duty status.

To qualify for LOD care, the injury or illness must be military-service related. LOD may also include injury or illness while traveling to or from a duty station.

What should you keep in mind?

TRICARE limits LOD treatment for a specific condition to one year from the date of your diagnosis. If you still need care after one year, you may be referred to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System.

If you have any non-service related or preexisting health conditions, they won’t be covered under LOD care unless documentation indicates that the condition was aggravated as result of military-related duty.

LOD care isn’t a government lifetime health plan.

LOD care isn’t available to family members.

Where can I get LOD care?

LOD care is available both in the U.S. and overseas. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you live.

In the U.S.:

A military hospital or clinic or the Military Medical Support Office at Defense Health Agency—Great Lakes can authorize your LOD care.

Overseas:

A military hospital or clinic or International SOS, the TRICARE Overseas contractor, can authorize your LOD care.

What happens once you get an authorization for LOD care? You can get care one of two ways:

If you live within 50 miles or one hour’s drive time of a military hospital or clinic, you must get your treatment there.

If you live remotely—more than 50 miles or one hour’s drive time from a military hospital or clinic—the MMSO will provide an authorization to the regional contractor so you can get care from a civilian provider. This includes care for both physical and mental health conditions.

These options apply in both the U.S. and overseas. However, if you’re a Reserve Component member stationed overseas:

MMSO doesn’t validate LOD status for you, except in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The TRICARE Overseas contractor can authorize your remote care from a host nation provider. They can also help you book your appointment.

Do you need emergency care or urgent care?

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. If you need urgent care, go to an appropriate urgent care facility. It’s important to know that emergency or urgent care isn’t a “one-off.” You need to meet LOD criteria, so you can get LOD urgent or emergency care without paying out of pocket.

Other tips for getting LOD care

Are you wondering what you need to get care? You’ll need to show proof of drill status, such as a muster form or Inactive Duty Training orders. This helps ensure a smooth LOD determination.

You’ll also need to ask your unit to submit DHA–GL Worksheet-01: Medical Eligibility Verification along with a unit sign-in sheet, muster form, or a copy of certified orders. Your submission must also include the urgent or emergency care medical notes. Your service unit must send this information to the MMSO as soon as possible after you get care.

Important: If you’re getting care under a LOD determination, do NOT use personal health insurance.

How do I submit LOD claims and view authorizations?

As detailed in the TRICARE Choices for National Guard and Reserve Handbook, your service Military Medical Authority determines your LOD status. However, you’ll submit claims to your regional contractor. Be sure to sign up to access your regional contractor’s secure beneficiary portal:

East Region (Humana Military)

West Region (TriWest Healthcare Alliance)

For other issues, such as primary eligibility in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System or incorrect claims processing, contact the MMSO or your military hospital or clinic:

Phone: 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676)

Email: Email the claims reprocessing Notice of Eligibility box at

dha.great-lakes.j-10.mbx.mmso-lod-misc@health.mil.

What about LOD dental care and pharmacy coverage?

What happens if you have a dental injury or illness while you’re activated for 30 days or less? You may qualify for LOD dental care. Be sure to have your service complete an LOD determination. Your commander or designated representative must sign the determination. Send it by email or mail to the dental contractor, United Concordia.

United Concordia will tell you if you’re approved and what type of treatment you’re approved for. Do you need more information? Call United Concordia:

CONUS: 866-984-2337

OCONUS: 844-653-4058

If your provider prescribes LOD-related drug for your LOD-related injury or illness, you can fill your prescription at a:

Military pharmacy

TRICARE retail network pharmacy

You won’t have any out-of-pocket expenses if you get your prescription at a military pharmacy. But you will pay upfront at a TRICARE retail network pharmacy and file a claim for reimbursement. Do you have questions about or need help filing for reimbursement? You can find detailed instructions, or call the MMSO at 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676), option 2.

Are you seeking additional information about LOD care? Check out Line of Duty Care for Service Members or call your regional contractor. You can also learn more at Line of Duty Care.

What’s Happening:

Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

Details:

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

Next Steps:

By Kevin Larson

The daily joy of a family meal turned into an emergency room visit, surgery, and an overnight hospital stay for retired Sergeant First Class Damien Dunn, a Soldier for Life and Winn Army Community Hospital beneficiary.

“I’m eating dinner, and I was feeling pain in my kidneys,” Dunn said. “I didn’t know what it was and I tried to let that passover, but my wife said just go to the ER.”

Dunn did the next morning, arriving at Winn’s emergency department. The healthcare team sprang into action, triaging him and charting the way ahead.

“They admitted me, ran some blood tests, ran a CT scan, then they figured out that my appendix was possibly ruptured, so I was going to have emergency surgery,” Dunn said.

Dr. Christina McCain, a general surgeon at Winn, was the doctor who performed Dunn’s appendectomy. She told him “we’re going to take care of you,” and Dunn said those words were comforting.

“I’d never had any surgeries before, but from ER into pre-op…I had full faith and confidence,” he said.

Assessing a patient’s condition quickly and determining the best treatment plan is critical, McCain said, especially in a situation like Dunn’s. Equally important, though, is establishing the rapport and trust Dunn found comforting, something McCain does with everyone she sees.

“I have always treated my patients like I would treat my own family,” she said.

After the ED prepared Dunn for the handoff, he noticed how smoothly the transition went. The teamwork between the units was remarkable.

“They moved as one cohesive unit,” he said. “They passed information from one person to another and then following up, making sure that post surgery that I was being take care of, whether taking vitals, making sure my meds are being taken care of, and checking blood pressure. They definitely have a real good team here.”

Dunn met certified registered nurse anesthesiologist Capt. Joseph Mazzarella at the pre-op area after being moved from the ED. Mazzarella and his team had been preparing to go home after reaching the end of scheduled surgeries for the day. That changed when they got word Dunn was in need of emergency surgery.

“We immediately did what we always did, go into action and get ready to go,” Mazzarella said. “We have a multidisciplinary team here at Winn to ensure the transitions from emergency room to the pre op area, to the operating room and to the inpatient care ward, are all smooth. We're a small hospital here, or community hospital, so it's very important that we all know each other. We're one team here.”

Before leaving the ED, an anesthesia teammate went to Dunn for a pre-check. Once he arrived at pre-op, Mazzarella did more checks, determining what levels of anesthesia were appropriate for Dunn factoring in specific things that came up as they talked.

“Mr. Dunn he looks like a big, tough guy, but when you talk to him, just soft, spoken, very friendly,” Mazzarella said.”He's had a 20 year experience in the army. I heard all about some of his experiences in the military, how that's affected him, and just taking that into consideration, I gave him the best care.”

The care Dunn received continued after he was discharged. McCain reached out to him, and he also took an opportunity to visit with Mazzarella. All those interactions gave him “a nice warm and fuzzy,” and built a camaraderie.

“Once a Soldier, always a Soldier,” Dunn said. “I felt like a tight knit family has been built. Moving forward, I’ll always keep that mindset, that I’ll always be taken care of, and know that my sisters and brothers will always be taken care of, whether in uniform or out of uniform.”

Knowing Winn is ready to take care of retirees like him while also ensuring the health of warfighters is reassuring to Dunn. His experience showed him the hospital goes above and beyond, not only in his case, but all beneficiaries, he said.

“I’m definitely grateful,” Dunn said. “I wouldn’t second guess coming back here for any treatments.”

With more than 30,000 Soldiers and other beneficiaries in the immediate are served by Winn, providing care for all of them ensures the Army’s lethality, Mazzarella said.

“Readiness starts with the warfighter,” he said. “Whether it’s here at Winn or downrange in an austere environment—we’re always ready to provide the best care.”

As the daughter of an Air Force veteran, McCain understands the need to provide healthcare for warfighters, retirees and families. It’s an honor to provide care at Winn, she said, both for retirees who made sacrifices for our freedoms and to keep warfighters reassured about their families’ health so they stay focused one the mission.

“They deserve exceptional care and I am humbled to be a part of this superb care team,” McCain said.

Col. Margaret Berryman, Winn director and Fort Stewart U.S. Army Medical Department Activity commander, echoed the importance of ensuring readiness by providing healthcare for the warfighters while also carrying for families and retirees like Dunn.

""Taking care of our retirees and families is a vital part of what we do,” Berryman said “It's a key part of our mission of warfighter readiness. Our Soldiers need to know their families are receiving safe, quality care so they can focus on their training and deployment. We owe our retirees this same level of commitment, honoring their service by providing them with the best healthcare.""",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Sep/26/2003809146/1920/1080/0/250916-O-TY372-3095.JPG,N,0.0,2025-09-26 23:56:42.836017

If lawmakers fail to reach a bipartisan agreement, service members may be required to fulfill their duties without pay, marking a significant shift in the lives of military families.

The implications of a government funding lapse could be far-reaching for active-duty personnel and their families. Service members risk missing their first paycheck by October 15 if negotiations don’t materialize, impacting everything from household budgets to essential services. National Guard operational drills and nonessential travel could also face interruptions.

To mitigate possible financial strain, Representative Jen Kiggans from Virginia has proposed a bipartisan bill aimed at safeguarding the paychecks of active-duty troops and reservists, including those serving in the Coast Guard. However, the bill is unlikely to come to a vote before the impending deadline, exacerbated by House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to keep the House in recess until after October 1.

Historical context underscores the critical nature of this situation; during the last government shutdown, which lasted for five weeks, many Coast Guard members experienced significant financial distress due to suspended paychecks. Although service members typically receive back pay once federal operations resume, the prospect of delayed payments, particularly concerning specialty pays and stipends, looms large.

The fate of civilian employees at the Pentagon also remains uncertain. Past experiences during government shutdowns have seen these workers either continuing without pay or facing furloughs. Recent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget suggests that potential layoffs may be considered in the event of a funding lapse.

In the realm of healthcare, essential medical and dental services within Department of Defense facilities are generally exempt from shutdown impacts. However, access to elective surgeries and procedures might be curtailed. Services provided through Tricare would continue uninterrupted.

Educational institutions run by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) are expected to remain open, although the continuation of sports and extracurricular activities hinges on nonappropriated funds. Meanwhile, child care access will vary, determined by local base staffing levels and demand.

Morale, Welfare and Recreation programs essential for maintaining operational readiness, such as mess hall services and select child care provisions, will likely persist through a shutdown. However, housing and food services generally remain operational during federal funding lapses, and military grocery stores are expected to stay open until their cash reserves are exhausted.

The historical context of the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which unfolded during President Donald Trump’s first term and lasted 35 days, serves as a cautionary tale. Past Pentagon contingency plans have indicated that certain overseas commissaries and those in remote domestic areas would continue to operate even after financial reserves are depleted, underlining the military’s commitment to ensuring that service members have access to essential resources.

As the deadline approaches, both military families and congressional leaders brace for the potentially disruptive consequences of a government shutdown, hoping for a resolution that meets the needs of all involved.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Impending-Government-Shutdown-Threatens-Military-Pay-and-Services.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-26 10:56:42.398923

Kim MacNeilly, Deputy Commander for Quality and Safety at Womack, has been awarded the DHA Patient Champion Certificate for her work at the facility.

The DHA describes the recognition as ‘a peer-to-peer recognition initiative that gives Military Health System staff an opportunity to recognize peers for their patient safety efforts,’ however MacNeilly is quick to point out that it says more about Womack than anything.

“Improvements in patient safety is a team effort, not the work of a single person,” she said. “This award recognizes the collaborative culture of learning and accountability that the entire team has built together. This recognition also affirms that our shared commitment to patient-centered care and safety are recognized and valued at our organization.”

The nomination reads “In recognition of your commitment to Patient Safety and the outstanding leadership displayed while promoting network-wide initiatives to integrate dental leaders into the six key MTF safety communication practices: demonstrating a clear understanding of a systems-based approach to quality and the importance of a fully integrated, high-reliability healthcare system. Your actions and Sensitivity to Operations approach exemplified commitment to providing Ready Reliable Care.”

“Lt. Col. MacNeilly’s recognition highlights the dedication of the entire Womack team to ensure patient safety in every interaction,” noted Col. Stephanie Mont, Commander of the Womack Army Medical Center. “Kim’s passion and commitment speak to the quality of leadership present across the hospital. We are incredibly proud of her hard work and tireless efforts to ensure that our patients receive the highest quality healthcare.”

Lt. Col. MacNeilly said the recognition came as a total surprise but even so, she is using the award to encourage others to keep up the reputation that Womack has built. “Focus on why we are here…the patients,” she said. “Every time you come to work, make it a better place for patients and for your team. Embrace continuous improvement through small, consistent efforts while also maintaining a positive, determined attitude. Lastly, focus on problem-solving and personal growth, like Aristotle’s adage, ‘Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit’, and stay proactive by not just thinking about improvements but actively implementing them.”

I was forced to Select when they cancelled Prime in my area(Middle TN). Anyway, compared to my neighbor who is paying $800 a month, I have no complaints. Bottom line, health care is messed up for everyone but for all of it’s faults Select isn’t bad

Retired and on TriCare Select since 2019. I have options close to where I live to be on and use Prime but have always stayed with Select.

I like the ability to go to any network provider for specialty care without having to jump through the referral hoops.

We made the switch to Select last year and no regerts so far. Better experience for the spouse, a few changes in copays and such, but a lot more flexibility. Fits us a bit better than Prime.

Yes. I’m retired and have TRICARE Select. It’s great.

I haven’t set foot in a military or VA medical facility in years. I was seen at a specialty clinic recently (no referral, just called and got an appointment) and had a copay of $37.

Prime is better in the long run… pays more and is cheaper in the long run… you may not always be close to the base … you’re young . I have had prime since I got out 20 years ago and never regretted it.

Depends on location really. In my case, far easier to get appointments at a facility in network vs going to Walter Reed for everything. The co-pays are whatever, it shouldn’t make that big of an impact. Select all the way.

Retired AF medic here. When I retired in 18, I kept Prime because we are close to a MTF and I already knew the lay of the land when it came to medical care where I’m at (was station in this area twice) and I needed to be sure my family would be taken care of. The MTF and outlying clinics can be frustrating at times and have been contemplating switching to Select and getting medical at my job to offset the copays and other fees. Remember that Select is Tricare’s 80/20 plan. If it can fit your needs and you can handle the increased copays, take it! More flexibility for you and your family.

Where I live, I have to use Tricare Select. It use to be free after the deductible at that time it was 300 bucks a year for the family, then a cost share of 20 percent of the allowable charge. A couple of years ago, they started charging 25 bucks a month to just be enrolled. Now it's closer to 30 bucks a month. I knew that once they started an enrollment fee, it would go up. But my family needs no authorization to see any doctor or specialist. My brother once told me it must be nice. His family plan runs over 750 a month. I told him I pre-paid my health insurance with 24 years of my life.

Tricare Select for my family in the national capital region. Pick a doctor and go, quite happy with the coverage. I have Medicare and TFL, I like that there are no more copays but don’t like the must keep Medicare to have TFL requirement, that’s a $370 bill I’d rather not have.",,N,0.0,2025-09-26 10:56:52.286621

CVS Health’s long-term care pharmacy arm, Omnicare, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following a nearly $1 billion legal judgment, putting the subsidiary and its connection with its parent company in jeopardy.

The filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas comes after a federal judge in July ordered Omnicare to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages. The case stemmed from a whistleblower lawsuit alleging that the company improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE by dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions or refills from 2010 to 2018. While CVS has argued the violations did not harm patients, the ruling created a significant liability for the business.

CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015 for $10.4 billion in cash plus $2.3 billion in debt, betting on long-term care as an important growth segment. However, the deal has been plagued with challenges, including integration hurdles and scrutiny over billing practices.

By isolating Omnicare’s liabilities in bankruptcy, CVS is attempting to contain the fallout and prevent broader impact on its core operations.

In announcing the filing, Omnicare stated that its pharmacy and clinical services will continue uninterrupted during the reorganization. The company secured $110 million in debtor-in-possession financing, subject to court approval, to support operations alongside ongoing cash flow. It also committed to maintaining wages and benefits for employees and paying vendors for obligations incurred after the bankruptcy filing.

Omnicare noted it may pursue a standalone restructuring or a sale of the business.

“The Company also intends to use this process to address other financial challenges facing the broader long-term care pharmacy industry and to evaluate its restructuring options, including the implementation of a standalone restructuring or sale strategy,” David Azzolina, president of Omnicare, said in a statement.

CVS had already previously explored a divestiture, when it sought to sell the organization in 2022 before putting its efforts on pause the following year.

The company has faced a string of legal battles and regulatory scrutiny before and after its acquisition.

In 2012, Omnicare paid nearly $50 million to settle allegations that it accepted kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for promoting certain drugs to nursing home patients. In 2014, it agreed to a $124 million settlement over claims it provided improper financial incentives to nursing homes to secure business.

In 2016, Omnicare agreed to a $28 million settlement to resolve allegations that it solicited or received kickbacks from nursing facilities. One year later, it agreed to pay $8 million to settle claims tied to improper billing of Medicare and Medicaid.

The Department of Justice then joined the whistleblower civil lawsuit in 2019, putting more pressure on CVS’ ability to keep Omnicare afloat.

Now, Omnicare’s liabilities have outweighed its strategic value to CVS, prompting the bankruptcy decision.",https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/sites/hlmp/files/files/cvs-health-building-shutterstock_1436567150_0.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-26 10:57:09.803483

If a National Guard or Reserve member is injured or becomes ill while on qualified duty status for 30 days or less, treatment may qualify under LOD care.
Do you need emergency care or urgent care?
Other tips for getting LOD care Are you wondering what you need to get care?","FALLS CHURCH, VA, September 25, 2025 - Are you a member of the National Guard or Reserve? If so, it’s important to know how TRICARE covers you if you become sick or are injured while activated for 30 days or less.

“TRICARE covers National Guard and Reserve members injured while in qualified duty status (under 30 days) through line of duty care,” said James Whitton, Chief, Military Medical Support Office at the Defense Health Agency. “LOD care covers treatment of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty if a LOD determination is approved.”

This article explores how, where, and under what circumstances National Guard and Reserve members can get LOD care.

How Does LOD care work?

If a National Guard or Reserve member is injured or becomes ill while on qualified duty status for 30 days or less, treatment may qualify under LOD care. This includes injury, illness, or disease that’s incurred or aggravated while on qualified duty status.

To qualify for LOD care, the injury or illness must be military-service related. LOD may also include injury or illness while traveling to or from a duty station.

What should you keep in mind?

TRICARE limits LOD treatment for a specific condition to one year from the date of your diagnosis. If you still need care after one year, you may be referred to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System.

If you have any non-service related or preexisting health conditions, they won’t be covered under LOD care unless documentation indicates that the condition was aggravated as result of military-related duty.

LOD care isn’t a government lifetime health plan.

LOD care isn’t available to family members.

Where can I get LOD care?

LOD care is available both in the U.S. and overseas. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you live.

In the U.S.:

A military hospital or clinic or the Military Medical Support Office at Defense Health Agency—Great Lakes can authorize your LOD care.

Overseas:

A military hospital or clinic or International SOS, the TRICARE Overseas contractor, can authorize your LOD care.

What happens once you get an authorization for LOD care? You can get care one of two ways:

If you live within 50 miles or one hour’s drive time of a military hospital or clinic, you must get your treatment there.

If you live remotely—more than 50 miles or one hour’s drive time from a military hospital or clinic—the MMSO will provide an authorization to the regional contractor so you can get care from a civilian provider. This includes care for both physical and mental health conditions.

These options apply in both the U.S. and overseas. However, if you’re a Reserve Component member stationed overseas:

MMSO doesn’t validate LOD status for you, except in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The TRICARE Overseas contractor can authorize your remote care from a host nation provider. They can also help you book your appointment.

Do you need emergency care or urgent care?

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. If you need urgent care, go to an appropriate urgent care facility. It’s important to know that emergency or urgent care isn’t a “one-off."" You need to meet LOD criteria, so you can get LOD urgent or emergency care without paying out of pocket.

Other tips for getting LOD care

Are you wondering what you need to get care? You’ll need to show proof of drill status, such as a muster form or Inactive Duty Training orders. This helps ensure a smooth LOD determination.

You’ll also need to ask your unit to submit DHA–GL Worksheet-01: Medical Eligibility Verification along with a unit sign-in sheet, muster form, or a copy of certified orders. Your submission must also include the urgent or emergency care medical notes. Your service unit must send this information to the MMSO as soon as possible after you get care.

Important: If you’re getting care under a LOD determination, do NOT use personal health insurance.

How do I submit LOD claims and view authorizations?

As detailed in the TRICARE Choices for National Guard and Reserve Handbook, your service Military Medical Authority determines your LOD status. However, you’ll submit claims to your regional contractor. Be sure to sign up to access your regional contractor’s secure beneficiary portal:

East Region (Humana Military)

West Region (TriWest Healthcare Alliance)

For other issues, such as primary eligibility in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System or incorrect claims processing, contact the MMSO or your military hospital or clinic:

Phone: 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676)

Email: Email the claims reprocessing Notice of Eligibility box at

dha.great-lakes.j-10.mbx.mmso-lod-misc@health.mil.

What about LOD dental care and pharmacy coverage?

What happens if you have a dental injury or illness while you’re activated for 30 days or less? You may qualify for LOD dental care. Be sure to have your service complete an LOD determination. Your commander or designated representative must sign the determination. Send it by email or mail to the dental contractor, United Concordia.

United Concordia will tell you if you’re approved and what type of treatment you’re approved for. Do you need more information? Call United Concordia:

CONUS: 866-984-2337

OCONUS: 844-653-4058

If your provider prescribes LOD-related drug for your LOD-related injury or illness, you can fill your prescription at a:

Military pharmacy

TRICARE retail network pharmacy

You won’t have any out-of-pocket expenses if you get your prescription at a military pharmacy. But you will pay upfront at a TRICARE retail network pharmacy and file a claim for reimbursement. Do you have questions about or need help filing for reimbursement? You can find detailed instructions, or call the MMSO at 888-MHS-MMSO (888-647-6676), option 2.",https://myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil/Content/images/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-09-26 12:56:35.806554

This collaborative effort brought together logistics professionals, Senior Enlisted Hospital Corpsman, Force Surgeons, Fleet Surgical Teams, as well as other clinical leaders across the Navy including representation from, Fleet Forces Command, Naval Surface Force Pacific, Naval Surface Force Atlantic, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and Defense Health Agency, to evaluate and validate medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and consumables required to sustain operational medical readiness aboard amphibious assault platforms.

The review focused on aligning AMALs with Required Operational Capability (ROC) and Projected Operating Environment (POE) to current fleet requirements, updated clinical standards of care, and lessons learned from recent operations. By refining medical allowances, the working group ensured that shipboard medical departments remain equipped to provide comprehensive healthcare services to Sailors and Marines during deployment and combat operations.

ABA has been a covered benefit for TRICARE beneficiaries through a demonstration program in 2014. But the new report published by the National Academy of Sciences recommends ending the demonstration program and adding ABA to TRICARE as a basic benefit.

The U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Health Agency contracted with the National Academy of Sciences as part of a directive within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 to examine the Autism Care Demonstration. On Sept. 9, the National Academy of Sciences released a report that, in part, finds that applied behavior analysis clinically effective and that the policies within the Autism Care Demonstration complicated care for beneficiaries and providers.

The report pushed back on an annual report produced by the Department of Defense in 2019 that found that ABA was not effective and did not meet TRICARE’s standard for proven medical care, contrary to many interpretations of the wider experience of treatment providers and present research.

“In terms of what this does for advocacy and next steps, it’s resounding,” Mariel Fernandez, vice president of government affairs at the Council of Autism Service Providers (CASP), told Behavioral Health Business. Those next steps will include further advocacy with Congress to follow the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences report.

“It’s not going to happen overnight,” she added. “But this allows us to be able to point congressional offices to a key set of findings that then can be incorporated into the next National Defense Authorization Act as soon as possible, which will then direct the DHA to make these changes. It’s an incredible first step, but it is just a first step.”

The Council of Autism Service Providers is a nonprofit trade association and accrediting entity.

The Department of Defense has largely kept up with the idea that ABA is not effective and does not meet TRICARE standards for treatment benefits despite advocate’s and expert’s protests.

“All of our military families were making the same consistent progress that we see in their civilian counterparts, and that made us wonder how TRICARE came to such a different conclusion,” Julie Kornack, a board member for the nonprofit advocacy group National Coalition for Access to Autism Services (NCAAS), told BHB about that 2019 report. “It became clear to us that we were going to have to do something different than just going to TRICARE and asking them to understand that they weren’t using the data correctly. That’s how we ended up advocating for this [National Academies] committee to review this independently.”

Kornack is also the chief government and payer relations officer at the Center for Autism and Related Disorders (CARD). CARD is an autism therapy provider that operates 108 locations across the U.S. and is headquartered in Marco Island, Florida.

She also said that the arrival of an independent review came with some degree of trepidation for industry advocates. It wasn’t clear to what degree an independent review would ultimately weigh the findings of the Department of Defense’s assessments against existing literature.

The report presented five core findings:

— ABA is widely recognized as an effective, evidence-based treatment for autism, but it is not necessary for everyone.

— Military families face more administrative hurdles than civilians in accessing ABA, challenging access.

— Rigid documentation requirements limit providers’ ability to tailor care and challenge providers’ ability to treat TRICARE patients in the first place.

— The mandated standardized assessments don’t align with tailoring care in a heterogeneous population and provide limited use individually or across the program.

— Current restrictions prevent targeting essential life skills and limit service settings.

“ABA is extremely data-driven: every good provider is going to be able to have data that shows how every patient is benefiting from the program,” Kornack said. “We understand that [TRICARE] want to have some standardized measures to look at. There is a way to do this without creating a burden.”

On top of making ABA a basic benefit, the report recommends that TRICARE eliminate its standardized assessment requirements and allow providers to pick the right assessments for each child, encourage but not require parent training, make the use of autism service navigators by parents optional and approve all CPT codes used by the industry to track and bill for care.

Additionally, the report recommends that TRICARE establish an independent advisory council to facilitate the transition from demonstration to a basic benefit.

“I really want to reiterate again for everyone that this does not mean that the benefit is changing tomorrow. There is a lot of work that will go into getting these recommendations enacted,” Fernandez said. “The best thing that the larger ABA industry and autism service industry can do right now is just say thank you to the [National Academies] committee for their hard work, and if there’s the need for, more focused advocacy to get this done, I am sure that there will be lots of grassroots efforts in the future.”",https://bhbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/09/files-folder-report-documents-paper-research-study-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-25 16:56:22.050666
