At Munson, there is no referral required for physical therapy, to include pelvic floor therapy.","FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas -- A group of military health professionals from Munson Army Health Center recently participated in a one-day continuing education Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Symposium in Overland Park, Kansas designed to enhance their medical readiness skills in rehabilitative musculoskeletal care and orthopedics.

“The event featured a series of expert-led presentations on topics such as shoulder labrum (SLAP) tears and return-to-sport protocols for athletes, ankle rehabilitation, as well as sleep hygiene and nutrition,” said Cpt. Kathryn Marr, a Doctor of Physical Therapy and chief of Munson’s Department of Rehabilitation.

Marr said events like this play a key role in ensuring military medical teams remain ready and on the cutting edge of their healthcare specialties, reinforcing the idea that medicine is a constantly evolving practice to improve patient outcomes.

“Things change. People are always doing research. New information is always coming out, so these events give us the latest evidence-based practices in rehabilitation and performance,” said Marr.

Marr was particularly fascinated with a presentation on a return to running program for patients recovering from stress injuries. She intends to share what she learned with Defense Health Agency peers and incorporate the treatment regimen into the clinic.

Beyond the educational benefits, the event served as a valuable team building and collaboration experience, allowing military and civilian practitioners to learn together and stay aligned on best practices, according to Marr.

The study raises serious concerns about the safety of the dangerous abortion pill.

The analysis, described as the “largest known study of the abortion pill,” was conducted by Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ryan Anderson and Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall.

The authors maintain this is the largest ever study of the abortion pill.

It examined insurance claims data from Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and private insurers, covering 865,727 mifepristone prescriptions dispensed to 692,873 women between 2017 and 2023.

According to the study, approximately 10.9% of these prescriptions—94,605 chemical abortions—resulted in “serious adverse events” such as emergency room visits, hemorrhages, sepsis, infections, or follow-up surgeries within 45 days of taking the drug. This rate starkly contrasts with the FDA’s reported complication rate, which pro-life advocates argue has been dangerously understated.

“The women in our dataset receive (or fail to receive) pre- and post-abortion healthcare of the real-world quality that prevails in the U.S. today, not the carefully controlled regimen of care that ordinarily prevails in a clinical trial,” the study says

“This study is the statistical equivalent of a category 5 hurricane hitting the prevailing narrative of the abortion industry,” Anderson said in a statement to The Federalist. “It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.”

Pro-life medical professionals have long criticized the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, first granted in 2000 under an accelerated process intended for drugs treating serious or life-threatening conditions. Critics, including the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, argue that pregnancy does not qualify as such a condition and that the agency overlooked significant risks to women’s health.

“The FDA should reinstate the original patient safety protocols that were required when mifepristone was first approved. Doing so will likely reduce the harms to women and permit better monitoring to determine whether this drug should remain on the market,” the authors note. “The FDA should further investigate the harm this drug causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether. Women deserve better than the abortion pill.”

The study’s findings come amid ongoing legal and policy battles over mifepristone.

In 2021, the Biden administration relaxed regulations, permanently allowing the dangerous abortion drug to be dispensed via mail and permitting pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS to distribute it. The FDA also reduced oversight, eliminating requirements for prescribers to report non-fatal adverse events unless a patient dies.

Pro-life advocates argue these changes have exacerbated risks, particularly as women can now obtain mifepristone through a single telehealth visit and self-administer it without in-person medical supervision. The study warns that this lack of oversight increases the likelihood of undetected complications, such as ectopic pregnancies or Rh alloimmunization, which can lead to severe bleeding or future pregnancy complications.

Last year, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits of mifepristone’s approval, citing a lack of legal standing for the challenging medical professionals. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion left open the possibility for future challenges, a prospect pro-life groups are pursuing in light of the new data.

The study calls for the FDA to reinstate original safety protocols, such as mandatory in-person visits and adverse event reporting, to better monitor mifepristone’s risks. It also urges a reevaluation of the drug’s approval status.",https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ru48617.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-28 11:56:35.636466

“The increasing dominance of PBMs poses a significant threat to consumers’ convenient access to prescription medications and pharmacy services, while at the same time charging taxpayers excessively and draining limited health care resources in public health programs like Medicare Part D, Medicaid, Tricare and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP),” said NCPA CEO B. Douglas Hoey in a letter to Rachel Riley, senior adviser for HHS.

The letter comes as Congress is considering whether to include PBM reforms in differing spending bills that have passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and must now be reconciled.

Hoey said DOGE should work with CMS to eliminate or significantly tighten up the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.

“We are concerned that pharmacies will have to float the program to the tune of roughly $11,000 per independent pharmacy per week; that pharmacies will not be paid fairly by PBMs; and that manufacturer refund payments to pharmacies will be delayed,” he said. “A recent study found that pharmacies could forfeit an average of $43,000 in annual revenue due to underpayments — roughly equivalent to a pharmacy technician’s yearly salary.”

Hoey cited reports by the Federal Trade Commission and the House Oversight Committee exposing numerous examples of anticompetitive practices that lead to higher drug costs, fewer options for patients and less competition in the retail pharmacy sector. He also pointed out that President Trump on several occasions called out PBMs as bad actors and that curbing their influence would be part of his plan for lower drug costs.

In 2000, the agency used those trials to justify fast-tracking abortion pill approval despite ongoing concerns about dangerous and fatal complications.
When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, the FDA radically relaxed its already debated regulation to permanently allow abortion pills via mail.
Women deserve better than the abortion pill,” the researchers conclude.","Abortion advocates, their allies in the corporate media, and even the U.S. Food and Drug Administration insist the pill responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions is “safe and effective.” A new, wide-ranging analysis of insurance claims regarding the abortion drug regimen, however, found that the rate of life-threatening complications due to mifepristone is at least 22 times higher than what the FDA and Danco Laboratories, manufacturer of mifepristone pill Mifeprex, suggest.

In the “largest known study of the abortion pill,” Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ryan Anderson and Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall used purchased Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare, Department of Veterans Affairs, and private medical insurance claim data to determine that 865,727 mifepristone abortion prescriptions for 692,873 women were handed out between 2017 and 2023.

Approximately 10.9 percent of those claims, or 94,605 chemical abortions, involved potentially life-threatening “serious adverse events” such as emergency room visits, hemorrhage, sepsis, infection, and/or follow-up surgeries for the women who had downed the abortion drug within the last 45 days.

That rate, which researchers adjusted to reflect “that some women suffer from adverse events in multiple categories,” is 22 times the FDA’s <0.5 percent estimation printed on the Mifeprex label. The researchers also suggest that the 45-day timeframe they used is “conservative, as some adverse events may present later (and studies relied on by the FDA used a timeframe as long as 72 days).”

“This study is the statistical equivalent of a category 5 hurricane hitting the prevailing

narrative of the abortion industry,” Anderson said in a statement to The Federalist. “It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.”

The FDA, the study notes, derived its mifepristone data from 10 clinical trials. In 2000, the agency used those trials to justify fast-tracking abortion pill approval despite ongoing concerns about dangerous and fatal complications.

The researchers not only warned that some of those trials are outdated and were conducted outside of the U.S., but they also emphasized the trials only included a fraction — approximately 30,966 hand-selected, “prescreened,” “generally healthy women” — of the mifepristone patients reflected in the insurance data.

“The women in our dataset receive (or fail to receive) pre- and post-abortion healthcare of the real-world quality that prevails in the U.S. today, not the carefully controlled regimen of care that ordinarily prevails in a clinical trial,” the study continues.

For more than two decades, pro-life doctors repeatedly asked the FDA to repeal its approval of the chemical abortion drug due to the life-threatening harm it causes women and babies, as The Federalist previously reported. The FDA repeatedly stonewalled the petitioners despite its legal obligation to address their concerns.

By the time the Obama administration was making its exit in 2016, the agency had worked overtime to expand the abortion pill’s use by changing its dosing, reducing the required number of doctor visits to obtain the drug, allowing more people than licensed doctors to prescribe the pill, and eliminating reporting standards for non-fatal complications from the pills.

When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, the FDA radically relaxed its already debated regulation to permanently allow abortion pills via mail. To further accommodate the Biden White House’s post-Roe activism, the FDA also permitted pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS to dispense mifepristone.

The study notes that as of 2023, a woman can obtain a mifepristone-induced abortion with “as little as one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider (not necessarily a physician)” and “self-administer drugs obtained from a mail-order pharmacy.” Even then, the study warns that a pill prescriber is not mandated to “report any adverse events unless he or she knows that a patient has died.”

“The FDA should reinstate the original patient safety protocols that were required when mifepristone was first approved. Doing so will likely reduce the harms to women and permit better monitoring to determine whether this drug should remain on the market,” the study concludes.

Changes like reinstating multiple in-person office visits, physician-only prescription, ultrasounds to confirm the gestational stage and rule out ectopic pregnancy, and mandated reporting of complications, the study suggests, could spare suffering women severe and even fatal fallout from the pill.

“The FDA should further investigate the harm this drug causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether. Women deserve better than the abortion pill,” the researchers conclude.

Last year the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the merits of the abortion pill’s approval, declaring that the coalition of medical professionals who challenged the Biden administration’s mail-order expansion of the drug did not have legal standing. The opinion penned by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, however, left the door open for the high bench to consider a stronger challenge if one should emerge.

,,2025-04-28 04:33:35+00:00,Live Action News,NEW STUDY: Nearly 11% of women suffer 'serious adverse events' after taking abortion pill,Nancy Flanders,,,,,https://www.liveaction.org/news/study-nearly-11-serious-adverse-abortion-pill/,"The study, “The Abortion Pill Harms Women,” published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), states that nearly 11% of women (10.93%) experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or other serious or life-threatening adverse events following a mifepristone abortion.
The study authors state that serious adverse events in multiple categories were accounted for in the reported rate.
Changes made to the REMS guidelines under Obama in 2016 and Biden in 2023 weakened safety requirements in order to increase access to the abortion pill.
Today, a woman can order the abortion pill with just one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider and can self-administer mifepristone that she obtains through a mail-order pharmacy.
Prescribers of mifepristone no longer need to report any adverse events unless a patient dies after the administration of the drug.","A new, first-of-its-kind study asserts that serious adverse events from mifepristone, the first drug in the abortion pill regimen, occur at a rate approximately 22 times higher than the rate reported on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) label for the drug.

The study, “The Abortion Pill Harms Women,” published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), states that nearly 11% of women (10.93%) experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or other serious or life-threatening adverse events following a mifepristone abortion. This means one in ten women experience at least one serious complication from taking mifepristone within 45 days — 22 times higher than the “less than 0.5 percent” serious adverse events rate reported by the FDA on the mifepristone label, according to this study. The study authors state that serious adverse events in multiple categories were accounted for in the reported rate.

The study examines the largest dataset to date regarding the abortion pill’s serious adverse events and is based on a HIPAA-compliant analysis of an insurance claims database that includes private health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Researchers state that they reviewed 865,727 prescribed mifepristone abortions that took place from 2017 to 2023, following the official FDA definition of “serious adverse event” when reviewing the data. This dataset is 28 times larger than the combined 10 clinical trials upon which the FDA relied upon for the drug’s labeled risk.

The researchers also point out that “The data excludes transactions for which the insurer is also the provider (as is the case with some HMOs and much VA care), as well as cash pay transactions (which are disproportionately common for abortion).”

“Simply stated, mifepristone, as used in real-world conditions, is not ‘safe and effective,'” the study’s authors stated.

The current FDA-approved drug label warning is based on the results of 10 clinical trials that included just 30,966 women, 0.5% of whom reported serious adverse reactions. Some of those trials date as far back as 1983.

Significantly, EPPC noted that the women in the large insurance database it used for its study were “not a prescreened group of generally healthy women recruited into various clinical trials conducted at different times around the world.”

Study authors, EPPC Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall and EPPC President Ryan T. Anderson, are calling on the FDA to revisit its previous research on mifepristone and reconsider the current regulation of mifepristone, which was scaled back substantially under the Obama and Biden administrations.

Anderson stated that the study “reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.” In the summary of the study, the authors recommend: “The FDA should immediately reinstate its earlier, stronger patient safety protocols to ensure physician responsibility for women who take mifepristone under their care, as well as mandate full reporting of its side effects,” and “The FDA should further investigate the harm mifepristone causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether.”

While Planned Parenthood claims the abortion pill is “safer than many other medicines like penicillin, Tylenol, and Viagra,” a study conducted by pro-abortion group Gynuity, released in 2021, found that 6% of women who took the abortion pill required a visit to the ER or urgent care for complications. That’s 107 times greater than the rate for acetaminophen/Tylenol (.056%) based on this analysis, and 33 times greater than the rate for penicillin (0.18%) based on this analysis. When compared to the new research from EPPC showing a 10.93% “serious adverse event” rate for the abortion pill, it becomes even more evident that Planned Parenthood’s claim is false.

Mifepristone was first approved for use as the abortion pill RU-486 in the United States in 2000 under the Bill Clinton administration, with several safety regulations in place. It was approved for up to seven weeks under the original Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which stated that women taking the abortion pill must have three in-person visits with the prescriber, who had to be a medical doctor. Mifepristone could only be administered in a clinic, medical office, or hospital under the supervision of a physician who was able to assess the gestational age of the child and diagnose an ectopic pregnancy.

Changes made to the REMS guidelines under Obama in 2016 and Biden in 2023 weakened safety requirements in order to increase access to the abortion pill.

Today, a woman can order the abortion pill with just one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider and can self-administer mifepristone that she obtains through a mail-order pharmacy.

In passing the FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act P.L. 110-417, however, Congress included measures establishing demonstration projects intended to find ways to contain costs through increased use of preventive care services by TRICARE beneficiaries. The scope of these measures are limited. Defense health care spending will likely remain an issue for the DOD in the next Administration, and Congress can anticipate being asked to consider new proposals to constrain costs.

Complaints from military families increased back in January when their health benefits switched from Humana to TriWest.

It's not unusual for benefits to change year to year but more often than not, the transition is smooth.

The rocky transition is not only generating complaints from military families, even service providers report having issues with TriWest.

Britt Sims owns and operates integrated behavior solutions in San Antonio, providing service to children and teens with autism. 90 percent of his clients have coverage with TriWest. Because of problems with TriWest, he says he's had to take out loans to keep his doors open.

After our report, TriWest responded with a statement that reads in full:

At TriWest Healthcare Alliance, there is no greater honor than helping our nation’s heroes get the health care they have earned. Paying provider claims accurately and quickly is a top priority at TriWest. To date, TriWest has processed more than $6 million TRICARE claims totaling $830 million, including 167,000 Autism claims – a particular area of focus for TriWest. We are actively processing and paying claims for dates of service in 2025, when we began administering the TRICARE program in 26 western states. As challenges with referrals, authorizations or claims arise, our dedicated team is working diligently to resolve any issues impacting beneficiaries and providers. TriWest is confident in our ability to get this right because of our long, successful partnership with VA. On average, we pay VA community care provider claims within 3 to 5 days to 99 percent accuracy. We are committed to reaching this same level of efficiency and accuracy for TRICARE providers.

Meanwhile, we are working to get answers on this still developing story including:

When will providers who took out loans to keep providing services to military families be paid the money they say they're owed?

When it comes to plans to address concerns, we're working to find out just how many people are on the TriWest resolution team?

How large are their individual case loads?

When can military families expect things to be fully resolved?

We'll continue to work to get answers on this developing story and others.",https://news4sanantonio.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/49daedd1-4200-46c8-a21e-6f4513e9cfdf-SVTRIWESTSOT_VO.transfer_frame_536.jpeg,N,-1.0,2025-04-27 21:56:18.548248

One effective way to determine which Tricare plan to bill for different patients is to verify the patient's eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). This system provides up-to-date information on a patient's enrollment status and the specific Tricare plan they are eligible for. Tricare is a healthcare benefit program for military personnel in all seven uniformed branches, and eligibility requires enrollment in DEERS.1

Steps to Verify Eligibility:

Collect the patient's personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, Social Security number).

Access DEERS to check the patient's enrollment status.

Identify the specific Tricare plan (e.g., Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare for Life) based on their eligibility.

Scenario for Tricare for Life Eligibility

A patient would be eligible for the Tricare for Life plan if they meet the following criteria:

They are a Medicare-eligible retiree or a dependent of a retiree.

They are enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Example Scenario:

A retired service member turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare. Since they have both Medicare Parts A and B, they are now eligible for Tricare for Life, which acts as a secondary payer to Medicare.2 Tricare for Life is specifically designed for retirees eligible for Medicare, providing coverage for coinsurance and deductibles.3

Billing for Injured Active Duty Service Member

If an active duty service member is injured on the job, you would bill Workers' Compensation rather than Tricare.

Explanation:

Active duty service members are covered under the military's health care system, but injuries sustained while on duty are typically addressed through the military's own processes or Workers' Compensation.4 Billing Workers' Compensation ensures that the costs associated with the injury are covered appropriately, as it is designed to handle work-related injuries. This is because Workers' Compensation is specifically structured to cover medical expenses and lost wages due to work-related injuries, ensuring that the financial burden does not fall on the service member or their family.5

Medicaid

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals and families. Here are some key points:

Eligibility: Varies by state, but generally includes low-income families, pregnant women, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities. States have the flexibility to expand coverage beyond federal requirements, which can lead to variations in eligibility and benefits across states. The Affordable Care Act has allowed states to receive federal assistance to expand Medicaid coverage to more individuals who were previously ineligible.1

Coverage: Includes a range of services such as hospital visits, doctor visits, long-term care, and preventive services. Medicaid benefits are comprehensive and include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, and more.2

Cost: Typically low or no cost for eligible individuals, with some states charging nominal fees. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal and state governments, with states having the discretion to determine the scope and cost of services.3

Tricare

Tricare is a health care program for military personnel, retirees, and their dependents. Key features include:

Eligibility: Available to active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, and their families. Tricare is designed to provide global coverage, which is essential for families stationed abroad or moving frequently.3

Coverage: Offers comprehensive health care services, including medical, dental, and mental health care. Tricare provides a variety of plans, such as Tricare Prime and Tricare Select, each with different coverage and cost structures.2

Plans: Various options such as Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, and Tricare for Life, each with different coverage and cost structures. Tricare requires enrollees to be treated at military facilities unless prior approval is obtained for treatment at civilian facilities.1

Worker’s Compensation

Worker’s compensation is a form of insurance that provides financial benefits to employees who suffer job-related injuries or illnesses. Here are the main aspects:

Purpose: To cover medical expenses and provide wage replacement for injured workers. It is designed to eliminate the need for employees to sue employers for negligence related to workplace injuries.4

Eligibility: Generally applies to employees who are injured or become ill due to their job. Employers are required to fund this insurance, and employees are not required to contribute to the cost.5

Benefits: May include medical treatment, rehabilitation, and compensation for lost wages. The benefits and coverage can vary by state, as worker’s compensation is a state-run program.6

Comparison Table

Feature Medicaid Tricare Worker’s Compensation Eligibility Low-income individuals/families Military personnel and families Employees with job-related injuries Coverage Comprehensive health services Comprehensive military health care Medical expenses and wage replacement Cost Low or no cost Varies by plan Employer-funded

Conclusion

Understanding the differences between Medicaid, Tricare, and worker’s compensation is essential for navigating health care options and benefits. Each program serves distinct populations and offers various services tailored to their needs. Medicaid and Tricare are both government-funded programs, but they cater to different groups and have different structures and requirements. Worker’s compensation, on the other hand, is a state-mandated insurance program funded by employers to protect employees from job-related injuries and illnesses.

Transition to a Payor-focused model and expansions of networks like Medicare and TRICARE promise revenue growth and improved profitability through a stable customer base.

AI-driven technologies and operational efficiencies enhance member engagement and reduce costs, leading to improved net margins and increased earnings.

Focus on Payor models and tech investments poses profitability and growth risks amid declining consumer revenue and marketing challenges.

About Talkspace

Operates as a virtual behavioral healthcare company that connects patients with licensed mental health providers in the United States.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

Expansion to Medicare and TRICARE networks will unlock coverage for significant new populations, potentially increasing revenue due to a broader customer base.

The shift from a consumer subscription model to a Payor-focused approach has increased coverage to 179 million people, which is likely to enhance revenue growth and improve net margins due to a more predictable and scale-efficient business model.

The development and implementation of AI-driven technologies, such as Talkcast and other tools to improve the member journey, can enhance member engagement and retention, potentially boosting revenue and net margins by decreasing churn and increasing utilization rates.

Operational efficiencies, such as a decrease in operating expenses and an overall increase in the effectiveness of marketing spend, should improve net margins and earnings.

Strategic partnerships and marketing initiatives focused on covered life populations, like the military and Medicare recipients, are anticipated to enhance revenue growth and sustained profitability due to higher return on investment in these targeted marketing efforts.

Talkspace Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

Analysts are assuming Talkspace's revenue will grow by 21.4% annually over the next 3 years.

Analysts assume that profit margins will increase from 0.6% today to 11.4% in 3 years time.

Analysts expect earnings to reach $38.1 million (and earnings per share of $0.19) by about April 2028, up from $1.1 million today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the analysts price target, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 25.8x on those 2028 earnings, down from 457.8x today. This future PE is greater than the current PE for the US Healthcare industry at 23.8x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to decline by 0.74% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 6.21%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Talkspace Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The shift towards a Payor-focused model and the resulting decline in gross margins may pose a risk to overall profitability, as the company navigates the trade-off between lower gross margins and the anticipated long-term benefits of improved unit economics.

Decreasing consumer revenue, as Talkspace focuses on Payor and DTE models, could negatively impact top-line growth if Payor-based strategies do not expand as projected, affecting revenue growth and market penetration.

Challenges in marketing strategies, particularly reaching new segments like Medicare and military populations, could lead to inefficient spend and slower user acquisition, impacting revenue growth.

Potential pricing pressures in negotiations with Payors, if they were to arise, could influence revenue levels negatively, despite current stable pricing conditions.

Heavy reliance on technologies to improve member retention and engagement may not yield expected results, which could adversely affect earnings by not generating sufficient return on investment in technological enhancements.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The analysts have a consensus price target of $5.0 for Talkspace based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors.

In order for you to agree with the analyst's consensus, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $335.8 million, earnings will come to $38.1 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 25.8x, assuming you use a discount rate of 6.2%.

Given the current share price of $3.12, the analyst price target of $5.0 is 37.6% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

The correct answer is health care finder.

Explanation

A health care finder plays a crucial role in the TRICARE system by assisting primary care providers with:

Preauthorizations

Referrals to health care services

Coordination between military treatment facilities and civilian provider networks

This position ensures that beneficiaries receive the necessary care in a timely manner. Health care finders facilitate administrative activities, such as referrals to the right military facility or civilian provider network. They also support patients in locating appropriate healthcare providers, aid patients in comprehending their health insurance benefits, arrange appointments, and facilitate the coordination of care.1

Summary of Options

Option Description Beneficiary services representative Assists beneficiaries with inquiries and issues related to their benefits. Health care finder Assists with preauthorizations and referrals. Nurse advisor Provides clinical advice and support but does not handle referrals directly. Primary care manager Oversees patient care but does not specifically handle preauthorizations.

In summary, the health care finder is the role that specifically assists with preauthorizations and referrals in the TRICARE system. They are essential in ensuring that beneficiaries navigate the healthcare system effectively, which includes understanding their benefits and accessing the necessary medical services.

Table 2 shows the coefficients from standard logistic regression, prior correction regression, weighting regression, and reduced non-event sample regression.
These methods, based mostly on large-sample normal approximation (particularly inverse-variance) [31,32,33], lack power to investigate the incidence of rare events.","In outcomes research data, we deal with rare cases frequently. Currently, about 7,000 rare diseases have been identified, with an estimated 300 million people affected globally [1]. Rare diseases, although individually unique, collectively represent substantial unmet health and social care needs and a significant public health challenge to society as a whole [1]. Definitions of rare diseases vary: [1] under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, a rare disease is defined as a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals [2], whereas it is defined as a condition that affects fewer than 5 people per 10,000 population in Europe [1].

It is estimated that 95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment [1, 3, 4]. The treatments for the remaining 5% are frequently expensive and relatively unknown. In addition to the high research and development costs associated with largely limited treatment options, the rather small market for rare diseases is conducive to prohibitive pricing. Rare diseases present a challenge for clinicians in reaching a conclusive diagnosis and determining an appropriate course of treatment due to their low prevalence, heterogenicity, and complexity [1, 5, 6]. Thus, it can be challenging to predict and estimate rare-disease outcomes in a real-world setting.

A rare event is defined as a binary dependent variable characterized by dozens to thousands of times fewer 1’s (i.e., rare diseases, treatments, newly approved medications) than 0’s (“nonevents”) [7]. There are two main reasons for the difficulty in estimating rare events.

First, standard logistic regression can sharply underestimate the probability of events. Therefore, the estimates would be biased. One real-life example is working with data on a rare disease such as bullous pemphigoid (BP), a rare skin condition. It is estimated that BP affects fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S., primarily older people [8]. The most common treatment is prednisone, but long-term use increases the risk of weak bones, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and infection. As an alternative, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is effective, although optimal use of IVIg is yet to be determined. Most adverse effects of IVIg infusions are transient, infusion-related symptoms that do not have long-term sequelae, although serious adverse events such as thrombosis, renal dysfunction, and acute renal failure have been noted [9]. Additional concerns about IVIg treatment include its potential toxicity and cost. While a single infusion starts at $5,000 to $10,000, treatment usually requires repeated cycles for which insurance coverage is not always covered. Therefore, it is essential to know the probability of using IVIg treatment for a rare disease.

To study the usage pattern of IVIg therapy in BP, we can formulate the model as follows: Let the outcome variable (e.g., whether the patient had IVIg therapy) be \(\:{y}_{i}\) and follow a Bernoulli probability function that takes on the value 1 with probability \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}\). Let \(\:{x}_{i}\) be the vector of explanatory variables such as age, comorbid conditions, gender, or insurance type. Then it can be shown that the variance matrix takes the following form:

$$\:V\left(\widehat{\beta\:}\right)={\left[{\sum\:}_{\text{i}=1}^{\text{n}}{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}}\left(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{1}\right){\text{x}}_{\text{i}}{x}_{i}^{{\prime\:}}\right]}^{-1}$$

Rare events have small estimates for \(\:{{\uppi\:}}_{i}\) observations. Standard logit models that use approximation rather than actual values will usually have larger values for \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}\). Thus, \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}})\) will be larger for 1’s than 0’s, stating that 1’s are more informative than 0’s in rare events. Since rare events have small sample sizes (usually < 200 observations), the logit models will yield a suboptimal result [7]. Therefore, logit models need to be adjusted to control this effect.

The second problem is related to how the data are collected. There is a fear among analysts that collecting data sets with no events (and thus with no variation on outcome measures) has led researchers to choose very large data sets with few, and often poorly measured, explanatory variables. For example, to avoid rare events, a researcher could include a broader sample by including a wide variety of International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes, a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II alphanumeric code issued by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (J-Codes), or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes rather than specific codes. This technique will cloud the estimates, making it challenging to see the true effect of treatment on an actual targeted sample.

The twofold problem outlined above arises when predicting health outcomes of rare diseases, rare treatments, or small numbers of recently approved medications. The objective of this study is to apply correction methods used in other rare event studies such as major stock market crashes to solve the aforementioned issues in performing research on rare diseases.

For this retrospective cross-sectional study, we extracted de-identified patient data for fiscal years (FYs) 2019 to 2022 from the Department of Defense TRICARE data. Each FY (October 1–September 30) is based on the U.S. federal budget calendar. The data from Military Health Services (MHS) has been recognized as a model of equitable healthcare access across socioeconomic and racial groups. The U.S. MHS is a global healthcare network with a diverse population that is more representative of the U.S. population than other data sets, with fewer disparities in healthcare services. The system serves 9.6 million beneficiaries, including active-duty service members, retirees, and family members, on an annual budget of $53 billion. The MHS delivers care through a direct-care/health maintenance organization system for Department of Defense military treatment facilities and a purchased-care/preferred provider organization system for civilian facilities. In addition, the MHS provides universal coverage for its beneficiaries under its TRICARE program. The data do not capture healthcare delivery in combat zones or care received in the Veterans Administrative system. All individuals were in the TRICARE Prime® managed care option.

Patients with BP were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes (L12.0). Our outcome variable was the use of IVIg therapy and identified by J codes (J1459, J1554, J1556, J1557, J1561, J1566, J1568, J1569, J1572, J1599). The inclusion criteria used were adults (≥ 18 years), diagnosed with BP and treated with or without IVIg. IVIg date was the index date; the index date for the non-event cohort was randomly assigned between the earliest IVIg date and latest IVIg date.

Patient age, gender, and comorbidities were available in the data sets. We identified the top 10 comorbidities associated with BP. Hypertension emerged as one of the most prevalent comorbidities in patients with BP, with studies reporting its occurrence in up to 76% of cases [10]. The association between hypertension and BP is hypothesized to stem from shared inflammatory pathways or medication effects. Esophageal involvement is another frequent complication in BP cases, potentially manifesting as reflux symptoms or, in some instances, esophagitis dissecans superficialis [11]. Dermatological comorbidities are also common in patients with BP. Research has demonstrated an increased risk of BP in patients with pre-existing dermatitis, and BP may initially present with eczematous or urticarial lesions before the characteristic blistering occurs [12]. Rash, a primary symptom of BP itself, often manifests as urticarial plaques preceding blister formation [13]. Urinary tract involvement is another significant comorbidity in patients with BP. One study reported characteristic lower urinary tract lesions in 93% of BP cases [14]. The increased prevalence of urinary tract infections in patients with BP is attributed to advanced age and the use of immunosuppressive treatments [14]. Neurological comorbidities are frequently observed in patients with BP, often manifesting as limb pain. Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been found to have a significant association with BP, with one study reporting an odds ratio of 5.36 for neurological diseases, including MS, in patients with BP [15]. Cardiovascular comorbidities are also prevalent in patients with BP, with dyspnea being a common related symptom [16]. Additionally, several studies have reported an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in patients with BP [17]. A flag was created for patients who had at least three of the following comorbidities: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, esophagitis reflux, dermatitis, urinary tract infection, limp pain, rash, skin cancer, dyspnea, and MS prior to treatment to proxy for severity.

For descriptive analysis, we compared the patients with and without IVIg therapy. Numbers and percentages were provided for dichotomous and polychotomous variables. Means and standard deviations were provided for continuous variables. For dichotomous and polychotomous variables, P values were calculated according to the chi-square test, and for continuous variables, t-tests were used to calculate P values. Nonparametric tests (e.g., the Mann-Whitney U test, log-rank test, or McNemar test) were applied if there was a deviation from asymptotical assumptions.

Since it is well documented that logit coefficients are biased in small samples, we proposed a correction method to solve the possible “rare event” bias in log estimation. Consider a logit model for outcome variable y and set of k explanatory variables x:

$$\:\left[P\right(y=1\left|x\right)=\:G({{\upbeta\:}}_{0}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{1}{x}_{1}+\dots\:+{{\upbeta\:}}_{k}{x}_{k})],$$

where G is the logistic function:

$$\:G\left(z\right)=\:exp\left(z\right)/\left[1+exp\left(z\right)\right],$$

which is between 0 and 1 for all real numbers z.

To apply the first correction method, we obtained information about the fraction of 1’s in the population \(\:{\uprho\:},\) and then the observed fraction of ones in the sample \(\:\stackrel{-}{y}\). Then the adjusted coefficient in the logit model is

$$\:\widehat{{{\upbeta\:}}_{0}}-ln\:\left[\left(\frac{1-\rho\:}{\rho\:}\right)\left(\frac{\stackrel{-}{y}}{1-\stackrel{-}{y}}\right)\right].$$

Note that prior correction affects only constant terms (therefore, not the odds ratio), but since most of the time interest lies in estimated probabilities:

$$\:{\pi\:}_{i}=\:{\left(1-{e}^{({\beta\:}_{0}+{\beta\:}_{1}{x}_{1}+\dots\:+{\beta\:}_{k}{x}_{k})}\right)}^{-1},$$

it is necessary to estimate a rare-event bias-adjusted constant term, with the first correction technique, called prior correction.

For the second correction technique, we used weights determined by the proportion of 1’s and 0’s in the sample to equal the true proportion in the population, letting \(\:{w}_{1}=\frac{\rho\:}{\stackrel{-}{y}}\) and \(\:{w}_{o}=\frac{1-\rho\:}{1-\stackrel{-}{y}}\) be the dependent variable and weighting independent variables by \(\:{w}_{1}\) if \(\:{y}_{i}=1\:\)and \(\:{w}_{o}\) if \(\:{y}_{i}=0.\) Then, we ran a standard logistic regression of weighted dependent and independent variables. In other words, the second correction technique aims to address the issue of imbalanced data in logistic regression by applying weights to both the dependent and independent variables. The rationale for this technique is to adjust the influence of each observation in the model to reflect the true events (1’s) and nonevents (0’s) in the population. By doing so, it attempts to correct for the bias introduced by imbalanced samples, where one class may be overrepresented or underrepresented compared with the true population. For example, if age=75 and w=1, the age variable would remain 75, but the observation would be a given weight of 1.5 in the model fitting process. This means that this observation would have 1.5 times the influence on the model parameters compared with an observation with a weight of 1. To solve commonly used data collection biases under rare-event data, King and Zeng have proposed collecting all (or all available) 1’s and a small random sample of 0’s to avoid losing consistency or even much efficiency relative to the full sample [7]. Wang et al. have also proposed an adjusted logistic propensity weighting method, a more advanced version of this approach [18]. Both methods were validated under different scenarios (e.g., varying sample sizes, different event rates) using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, as described in previous research [7].

For the second part of the analysis, we tested differences in predicted probabilities. We proposed nonparametric tests since these tests are most appropriate when the sample sizes are small. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test were used on predicted probabilities of logit regressions to see whether differences exist. To assess the independence of our predictor variables in the regression model, we employed two established methods: variance inflation factor analysis and examination of pairwise correlations.

The analysis used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) and STATA 17 (STATA Corp., LLC).

We identified 2,720 unique individuals diagnosed with BP in FY 2019–2022. Among these patients diagnosed with BP, 14 were treated with IVIg. The remaining sample was a non-event cohort (n = 2,706). Overall, 54.19% of individuals were women, and 85% of our sample was 65 years or older (mean, 78 years). We identified the most frequent 10 comorbidities from our sample. According to Table 1, the most frequent comorbidity prior to treatment with IVIg was hypertension (61.32%), followed by hyperlipidemia (37.20%), pemphigoid (34.70%), pain limp (24.15%), dyspnea (23.82%), dermatitis (23.49%), skin cancer (22.31%), urinary tract infection (20.25%), esophageal reflux (19.44%), and rash (16.43%). Within this sample, 54.08% of patients had more than three comorbidities within one year prior to treatment.

Patients with BP receiving IVIg therapy were younger (65.07 vs. 75.85, P =.0016) and more likely to be female (13 vs. 1, P =.0036). Overall, patients with IVIg treatment had significantly more comorbidities than patients without IVIg therapy. (78.57% vs. 53.95%, P =.0653). Patients receiving IVIg therapy also had a significantly higher likelihood of esophageal reflux (42.85% vs. 19.44%, P =.0265), dermatitis (57.14% vs. 23.49%, P =.0029), urinary tract infection (50.00% vs. 20.25%), P =.0055), and rash (42.85% vs., 16.43%, P =.0075).

Table 2 shows the coefficients from standard logistic regression, prior correction regression, weighting regression, and reduced non-event sample regression.

The correction rate for the prior correction technique assumes that the IVIg rate for BP is 0.00538918 (\(\:\rho\:)\). This rate is obtained from an open-claims database that covers 330 million patients in the United States. When comparing unadjusted rates for IVIg treatment, our rates were lower (0.00515). There was agreement on the sign of the coefficients across regressions. Older age, male self-identification, and fewer comorbidities decreased the likelihood of BP being treated with IVIg. Coefficients from weighting and prior correction logistic regression were statistically similar, but both were statistically different from and standard logistic regression (P =.0001). The coefficients from the regression that used the reduced random sample of non-events were also different from standard logistic regression (P =.004) (Table 2).

We randomly selected 140 patients from 2,706 non-event patients, so the total regression sample was 154, with 10% of the sample in the IVIg cohort (i.e., the rare-event proportion increased from 0.5% to 10%). The reduced random sample increased the event proportion in the regression sample. We calculated event probabilities for each group of patients with respect to age, gender, and comorbidities (Table 3). As expected, standard logistic regression significantly underestimated the event probabilities. The underestimation ranged from 11% to 102% using the prior correction method and from 15% to 107% using the weighting correction method. For example, standard logistic regression predicted that male patients 18 to 64 years old with few comorbidities have a 0.1% probability of receiving IVIg treatment; however, the actual probability was double according to prior correction and weighting correction. Random selection of non-event samples significantly biased the results and found probabilities 10 times larger than corrected probabilities and 20 times larger than probabilities calculated by standard logistic regression.

Rare-event correction affected the constant term the most. Table 3 shows the constant term for each model with its lower and upper confidence intervals.

The development of rare-event sampling techniques can be traced back to the early 1950s, primarily motivated by the need to solve complex problems in nuclear physics, particularly the neuron shielding problem that was crucial for designing nuclear facilities [19]. Later, researchers addressed the challenge of extremely rare events using Monte Carlo random sampling [20]. The importance of sampling methods, another key technique in rare-event simulation, also emerged during this period, setting the stage for the evolution of rare-event sampling techniques that continue to be refined and applied in various fields today [21]. For example, in physics, the search for dark matter involves detecting extremely rare particle interaction [22]. In earth sciences, methods were developed to analyze extremely rare natural disasters with occurrence rates of 1% or less [23]. In the telecommunication sector, researchers have focused on detecting and analyzing rare network anomalies [24]. In political science, case study approaches are used to analyze rare events like successful coups or the peaceful dissolution of countries [7, 25]. In economics, agent-based modeling used to simulate complex financial systems and identify conditions that may lead to rare market crashes [26]. In health care, researchers are used genomic sequencing techniques to identify genetic markers associated with rare disorders or Bayesian hierarchal models applied to analyze small sample sizes typical in rare diseases [27, 28]. Here, we applied a logistic regression technique for rare event rates among large sample sizes.

Due to the structured data entry system used by TRICARE, the data set used in this study had minimal missing data. Across all variables included in the analysis, less than 1% of data points were missing. This extremely low rate of missingness did not warrant the use of advanced imputation techniques or separate complete case analyses. The completeness of the TRICARE data contributes to the robustness of the findings and minimizes potential bias from missing information.

While the traditional rule of thumb for logistic regression suggests 10 to 20 events per variable are necessary, recent research has shown that this guideline can be relaxed under certain circumstances [29]. When dealing with rare events, total sample size becomes more critical than the number of events alone. The large sample size of 2,720 provides substantial information even with only 14 events. The empirical example provided here illustrates why specialized techniques for rare events logistic regression were developed. Several correction techniques were applied to a rare treatment for BP using a military health data set. As expected, the results yielded that standard logistic regression significantly underestimated the event probabilities. The underestimation in this study ranged from 11% to 102% using the prior correction method and from 15% to 106% using the weighting correction method. For example, in this study, standard logistics regression predicted that male patients 18 to 64 years old, with fewer comorbidities, have a 0.1% probability of receiving IVIg treatment; however, the actual probability was more than double according to prior correction and weighting correction. This discrepancy could give rise to a large margin of error and, ultimately, cost-ineffective decisions.

Furthermore, this study showed that the random selection of non-event samples significantly biased the results. The probabilities were found to be 10 times larger than the corrected probabilities and 20 times larger than the probabilities calculated by standard logistic regression. These results support King and Zeng’s findings, which indicated that a second, more important common problem in analyzing rare events lies in how data are collected [7]. The reduced sample size in this study demonstrated the most bias, supporting the idea that data collection can greatly influence results.

Other techniques such as meta-analysis have been suggested for rare event bias correction. However, meta-analyses of binary data can be problematic when the proportion of events is low [30, 31]. Meta-analyses of binary data are frequently performed using the standard inverse-variance fixed-effects model, based on large-sample normal approximation, or fixed-effects methods, based on exact distributional theory such as the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) or Peto model, or the standard random-effects DerSimonian-Laird (DL) model [31]. These methods, based mostly on large-sample normal approximation (particularly inverse-variance) [31,32,33], lack power to investigate the incidence of rare events. Therefore, their statistical properties for estimating treatment effects are often judged as suboptimal either through biased results, inappropriately wide confidence intervals, or insignificant statistical power to detect true differences.

The Cochrane guidelines (version 6.1, 2020) recommend the use of methods mostly accessible in Review Manager (RevMan), a free-access software developed by the Nordic Cochrane Centre [31, 33]. Its guideline suggests that, at event rates less than 1%, the Peto odds ratio should be utilized [31]. In circumstances where event rates are above 1% and meta-analyses involves many studies with imbalanced treatment groups, the MH odds ratio should be used [31, 34]. However, some of these methods, notably, the MH without continuity correction, logistic regression, and exact methods, are not available in RevMan. Second, meta-analysts must often revert from inverse-variance weighting to a random-effects DL model to reduce bias in estimation when heterogeneity is present.

Most recently, new methods, including maximum likelihood, profile likelihood, and restricted maximum likelihood or the nonparametric “permutations” methods, have been proposed for improved estimation of variance (τ) [31, 35, 36]. The nonparametric bootstrap of the DL estimator was shown to be a better performer in small meta-analyses that were falsely assumed to be homogenous under the standard DL model [31]. Although this nonparametric bootstrap of the DL model has now been extended for both the MH and Peto models, little is known about the performances of these methods in meta-analyses involving rare events when heterogeneity is an issue.

Limitations

This study utilizes data from the Department of Defense TRICARE system, which primarily serves military personnel, veterans, and their families. We acknowledge that this population may have unique characteristics that could affect the generalizability of the findings to the broader U.S. population [37]. TRICARE beneficiaries may have different healthcare access patterns, comorbidity profiles, and treatment preferences compared to civilians [38]. For instance, active-duty personnel might have better overall health due to physical fitness requirements, while veterans may have higher rates of certain conditions related to military service [39]. Additionally, TRICARE’s structured healthcare system and coverage policies may influence treatment choices and outcomes in ways that differ from other insurance plans [39].

This study also has several limitations related to the use of administrative data sets and retrospective analysis. Although retrospective studies are an important tool to study rare diseases, manifestations, and outcomes, their design is subject to limitations [40]. Since the analysis was done on the review of claims data that were not originally designed for research, some information is bound to be missing. Selection, recall, and loss of follow-up biases may affect how representative the data is for the rare event of interest.

Using an administrative database has many strengths as it includes a large population/base sample size, which provides an established denominator [41]. The data include patient demographics, clinical characteristics, detailed healthcare use, and cost information allowing for identification and comparison of treatments and outcomes across populations included in the data [41]. However, some limitations warrant mentioning. First, as with most claims-based data sources, there is a time lag between an individual’s receipt of services and when the files become available for research (average, 2–3 years) [41]. Thus, the data may not be generalizable to the entire population, as some information may be missed in processing or reimbursement. Also, not all health data are captured in the claims. Although diagnoses are included, information such as health-related behaviors, anthropomorphic data, and nonprescription medication use that may be found in medical records are not captured in the claims. Further, claims for which services were recommended but not yet received would not be captured in the data set. Additionally, administrative claims data lack information about the decision-making process (e.g., who made the decisions, how or why the decisions were made, the correlation between planned and received treatment, why treatment was altered or discontinued) and other patient-reported outcomes [41].

We recognize the potential for overfitting in our model given the limited number of rare-event cases (14 IVIg patients). To address this concern, we have included confidence around regression (see Table 2). Additionally, we acknowledge that the small sample size may limit the generalizability of our results. In future analyses, one can plan to explore regularization techniques such as ridge or LASSO regression to mitigate overfitting and improve model performance. These methods can help reduce model complexity and potentially enhance the robustness of our predictions, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or limited sample sizes.",https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/journal/12874,N,0.0,2025-04-26 09:56:44.393094

I submit that Tricare is better because it covers the veteran. CHAMPVA is the finest healthcare that the VA offers, and it’s particularly exceptional as a co-insurance, but it doesn’t cover the veteran unless both spouses are rated P&T.

ChampVa out of pocket max is 3k for the year. If you qualify for tricare you can not have ChampVa.

Use Tricare, the VA is a joke. The VA employees on here will disagree. As someone who has used both, If I could talk to myself before separating I would not have wasted my time with the VA. Just being honest.

Husband and I have Tricare Select and we love it. It's a PPO plan which means you go anywhere you want and do not need a referral.

It’s a day to safely dispose of unwanted, expired, or excess medications. But it’s also important to know that military pharmacies offer ways to safely dispose of drugs all year long through the Military Health System Drug Take Back program.

“National Drug Take Back Day promotes a healthier community by helping to prevent accidental misuse of expired or unused drugs,” said U.S. Army Maj. Danielle Zsido, Direct Care Branch Deputy Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the Defense Health Agency. “It also helps protect the environment by reducing the chemicals that can enter our water system.”

Why you should dispose of old prescriptions

Keeping expired or unused prescriptions at home can be risky. Children might find them, or someone might misuse them. Disposing of old prescriptions from home helps prevent potential harm and medication misuse.

Additionally, throwing drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet can harm our water supply and soil. When you dispose of drugs properly, you:

Keep children safe from accidental poisoning

Help prevent potential drug misuse

Protect your environment

Help keep your community safe

How military pharmacies help

Per Drug Enforcement Administration rules, pharmacists and other pharmacy staff can’t physically accept patients’ drugs for disposal. This is why you must physically put the drugs in the collection bin or envelope yourself, though the pharmacy is happy to provide you with the drug disposal receptacle. Every military pharmacy offers at least one way to dispose of drugs:

Secure blue drop boxes where you can leave unused drugs

Secure mail-in envelopes you can take home

The process is simple. Before you drop them off, just remove or black out your personal information on the labels.

What you can drop off

You can dispose of most drugs, including:

Prescription drugs

Over-the-counter drugs

Vitamins and supplements

Pet medications

Controlled substance prescription drugs

Note: You can’t dispose of more than four ounces of liquid drugs. You also can’t dispose needles, aerosol cans, or illegal drugs. If you aren’t sure whether you can drop off a certain item, check the list of items that your pharmacy will accept.

How to get rid of your expired or unused medications

Follow these simple steps:

Find your military pharmacy by visiting Find a Military Hospital or Clinic or calling directly.

Ask if they have a drop box or secure mail-in envelopes.

Remove personal information from prescription containers.

Drop off drugs during regular pharmacy hours.

Can’t get to a military pharmacy? The DEA has other drop-off sites on April 26. Check the DEA website to find one near you.

If you can’t get to a drop-off site and must dispose of drugs at home, follow these steps:

Remove drugs from original containers.

Mix with an undesirable substance like coffee grounds or cat litter.

Put the mixture in a sealable container.

Remove personal information from empty containers.

Place the sealed container in the trash.

It ripples through families, communities, and generations, making its impact especially profound for military families who already face unique challenges. According to recent studies, nearly 1 in 10 veterans struggle with substance use disorders. Mental health conditions like PTSD often go hand in hand with addiction. These numbers underscore why accessible, effective treatment is vital.

At Westwind Recovery® in Los Angeles, we understand the importance of addressing both addiction and mental health through personalized programs, including outpatient care and intensive options. For military families, TRICARE insurance can be a crucial lifeline, helping to reduce the financial burden of rehab while ensuring you or your loved one receives the care they deserve. By understanding TRICARE rehab services, you can take the first step toward lasting recovery and brighter futures for your family.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a healthcare program designed for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. It provides various plans that cover medical services, preventive care, and mental health support. The program ensures comprehensive healthcare for those serving in the military and their dependents, emphasizing the importance of mental wellness. It offers resources for counseling and therapy, which are crucial for service members transitioning back to civilian life or coping with military service stresses.

Eligibility for TRICARE

Eligibility for TRICARE extends to active duty service members, retired service members, and their families, including certain National Guard and Reserve members and survivors of deceased service members. Understanding eligibility via insurance is vital for military families seeking rehabilitation services. TRICARE also covers special populations, including those with disabilities, ensuring all service members and their families have access to necessary care, reflecting the program’s commitment to their health and well-being.

Types of TRICARE Plans

TRICARE offers several plans to meet the diverse needs of military families, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Each plan has distinct features, including network requirements and cost-sharing structures. Families should evaluate their options to choose the plan that best suits their needs.

For instance, TRICARE Prime requires a primary care manager, facilitating coordinated care. TRICARE Select offers flexibility in choosing healthcare providers, which is beneficial for those in remote areas. Understanding each plan’s nuances empowers military families to make informed healthcare decisions.

Understanding Addiction Treatment Services

Engaging in addiction treatment not only aids in physical recovery, but also plays a significant role in emotional and psychological healing, restoring confidence and independence. Addiction treatment services through TRICARE encompass various therapies aimed at helping individuals recover from substance abuse. These services can include detox, outpatient programs, intensive outpatient programs (IOP), and partial hospitalization programs (PHP). For military families, accessing these services through TRICARE is crucial for recovery and overall well-being.
