To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Heroes show their true colors when devastation hits.

When Hurricane Helene swept through the southeastern United States in 2024, it was the deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in almost 20 years.

Troy Akers, a physician and chief of emergency medicine at Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia, showed the world what real-world heroes look like in the storm’s aftermath.

Because of his heroism, Akers was named the 2025 Civilian Hero of Military Medicine in a ceremony on May 8, 2025.

The award recognizes Akers for his outstanding leadership, dedication to taking care of patients, and commitment to improving military medical practices.

""Dr. Troy Akers is a great example of the kind of dedicated person we are lucky to have in our unique health system,"" said Dr. David Smith, acting director of the Defense Health Agency.

Akers showed how he embodies selfless service during Hurricane Helene. Even though his own home was damaged, he focused on the needs of the community and the patients first.

""He grabbed a chainsaw and cut his way out of his home and local area so that he could reach the hospital. Which is where he stayed – around the clock – for the next eight days,"" Smith said. ""Dr. Akers stepped forward and made sure all patients were safely moved.""

The storm caused extensive damage, and the hospital lost power and water, forcing the evacuation of over 30 service members, family members, and civilians.

Akers coordinated the safe transfer of patients, including the critically ill, and worked with other hospitals to ensure everyone got the medical care they needed. He also led the effort to get the hospital back up and running after the storm.

Smith added, ""This is what leadership looks like during a crisis. These are the actions of someone who has the qualities we want: calmness, confidence, and caring for those he serves.""

Besides his leadership in emergencies, Akers is committed to teaching and training. He created a training program to improve skills for handling high-risk medical situations, benefiting over 250 health care workers.

Leaders at DDEAMC praised Akers for making the DDEAMC Emergency Room one of the best in the military health system. Akers focused on making things better, they said, which helped the department exceed national standards.

“With his leadership, DDEAMC was the first DHA medical center to create an emergency department team of DHA civilian interfacility transport paramedics,” said Col. (Dr.) Mark Craig, DDEAMC’s deputy commander for clinical services, when recommending Akers for the award.

“During times of chaos, such as Hurricane Helene, I witnessed his heroic efforts firsthand,” Craig added. “His commitment extends beyond daily responsibilities, showcasing remarkable resilience in catastrophic situations.”

A veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, Akers previously served on active duty in the U.S. Army as an emergency medicine physician. During a deployment to Afghanistan as the flight surgeon for Task Force Viper, he took part in over 200 combat missions, often while under direct fire. He improved how patients were evacuated, saving lives, and for his actions, received the Bronze Star Medal. He was also named the 2011 Flight Surgeon of the Year by the Army Aviation Association of America.

""There are many ways to serve your country, and Troy Akers is a perfect example,” said Smith.

Akers clearly began serving his country when he first raised his right hand and swore to defend the nation, and he continues to live by that oath now.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9032722/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-13 13:56:24.409755

We added one of the providers onto the call, and discovered that Tricare has switched their claims center from Wisconsin to South Carolina. My provider was unaware and had mailed my claim to Wisconsin. If anyone else in the east region is having a similar issue, I can provide the new address, fax number, and payer ID that your provider will need to submit a claim to the right location.

Thank you to whoever takes the time to read this. I've been having an absolutey awful time with Humana military/Tricare east this year, after 3 previous years with no trouble.

I have 3 providers after me for a combined total of 30,000 in medical bills that should be Tricare's responsibility. Two of these are providers I have been seeing for years with no issues.

I talk to their billing departments and go over how the claim was submitted, making sure they use my correct benefits number and other personal info. They resubmit the claims, and Tricare comes back and says something to the effect of ""patient could not be identified as ours"".

So I call Tricare. They are adamant that I am insured, evidenced by the claims that have been approved this year, some from the same providers on the same day as the one that are getting denied. They saiy it is an issue with how the providers are submitting the claim.

I can see the approved claims in my EOB, but the denied claims don't show up at all. I got claim numbers from the providers and asked Tricare about them and they said they had no record of them.

The providers are adamant that the claims are submitted correctly. One even offered to go on a 3 way call with me to try to get it straightened out. When I told the Tricare rep I wanted to do that she said that wasn't allowed and they could only talk to provider claims.

Now I feel backed into a corner with no idea what to do next and terrified these bills will fall on me. What can I do next at this point in the process?

I haven't been sent to collections yet but one of the providers is starting to get a little more aggressive.",,N,-1.0,2025-05-13 14:56:37.134743

Sgt. Loura Javier, surgical technician, 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, is leading a groundbreaking training partnership between JBER and Alaska Native Medical Center, a 182-bed, level 2 trauma hospital in Anchorage.

Javier designed and launched a rotational training program that places one Defense Health Agency surgical technologist at a time into ANMC’s 11-suite operating room department for a month-long immersive experience.

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts. “This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees. “Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

Javier’s forward-thinking approach is setting a new standard for training innovation within military medicine. Her efforts are not only advancing individual proficiency but also ensuring that JBER’s surgical technologists are better prepared for any operational challenge.

“Her leadership has created a model for future partnerships,” said Col. Laura Baugh, commander 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier embodies the spirit of excellence, and her work will have a lasting impact on the future of military medical training.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9030512.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-13 15:56:36.154285

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022.
“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt.
“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care—it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said.
Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health.","SAN DIEGO, Calif. — Naval Medical Center San Diego held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the expansion of its 1 West inpatient mental health ward—an initiative that marks a significant step forward in strengthening behavioral health care for active duty service members, veterans, and beneficiaries.

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022. Through a coordinated vision shared among leadership, clinical departments, facilities staff, and safety experts, the project was brought to life with the goal of increasing access, improving therapeutic outcomes, and reinforcing the Navy’s commitment to warfighter readiness.

""When our service members are struggling, it affects not only their individual readiness but the collective strength of our force,"" said Rear Adm. Guido Valdes, Commander, Naval Medical Forces Pacific, and Director, Defense Health Network Pacific Rim. ""By delivering high-quality, evidence-based mental health services in a secure and supportive environment, this unit will ensure our warfighters receive the care they need to recover and return to duty—or transition with dignity to the next phase of their lives.""

The newly expanded 1 West ward moves NMCSD closer to its goal of increasing capacity from a historic 36-bed limit across the 1 North and 1 West units to a total of 48 beds by the end of the calendar year. The initiative is expected to eliminate active-duty disengagements to civilian care, improve engagement with veterans and beneficiaries, and generate an estimated $22.7 million in annual purchased care savings once all 24 new beds are staffed and in use.

“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt. Elizabeth Adriano, Director of NMCSD. “By retaining our service members in a military treatment facility, we preserve readiness, reduce costly external placements, and expand care access to those who have served and continue to serve.”

The original 1 West ward was last renovated in 2008, primarily to meet updated safety requirements. The current expansion project not only reinforces safety standards with structural upgrades—including ligature-resistant door hardware, lock replacements, and improved CCTV—but also places a strong emphasis on enhancing the therapeutic environment. Patients now benefit from access to a large outdoor courtyard, greater privacy, and improved treatment areas that support individualized care.

Additionally, the Program of Care has been refined to offer tailored therapeutic experiences, aligning treatment groups and clinical interventions with each patient’s specific diagnosis and symptom profile.

“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care—it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said. Cmdr. Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health. ""In addition, the expansion allows us to accept and treat a more diverse group of patients, which directly serves our multiple training programs, including the Navy’s largest psychiatric residency.”

The project’s success was the result of a joint plan of action and milestones developed by the Directorate for Mental Health and the Directorate of Nursing Services, encompassing hiring initiatives, infrastructure improvements, space reorganization, and key procurement milestones.

The ribbon-cutting event highlighted the collective dedication and vision of the NMCSD team to deliver high-quality, mission-aligned behavioral health services that preserve the force, support families, and promote holistic well-being.

The mission of NMCSD is to provide a superior experience for our patients, staff, and warfighters. NMCSD employs more than 5,000 active-duty military personnel, civilians, and contractors in Southern California to deliver exceptional care afloat and ashore.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9031550.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-13 14:56:41.805157

To address this, the Department of Defense offers behavioral health care—such as treatment for depression or substance use—through its TRICARE health program.

Participants can seek this care from private providers, who then must submit claims to be paid for it. Our work included looking at how quickly DOD contractors processed claims from behavioral health providers for care delivered from 2018 through 2023.

These claims were generally processed as quickly as other types of claims, with almost 90% processed within 30 days.

What GAO Found

The Department of Defense's (DOD) two managed care support contractors generally processed TRICARE claims for care provided between 2018 and 2023 within required timeliness standards. The claims process involves determining payment amounts to civilian health care providers, including behavioral health providers. DOD's timeliness standards require contractors to process 98 percent of TRICARE claims within 30 days, and 100 percent of claims within 90 days.

Although DOD does not apply these standards to specific provider types, GAO separately analyzed the nearly 28 million claims from behavioral health providers over the 6-year period. GAO found that almost 90 percent were processed in 30 days. In addition, the percentage of claims processed within 30 and 90 days generally increased each year (see figure for the 3 most recent years).

Time to Process TRICARE Claims Submitted by Behavioral Health Providers for Care Provided in Calendar Years 2021-2023, by Managed Care Support Contractor

To oversee TRICARE payment accuracy, DOD monitored internal and external audit reports of randomly sampled claims from all types of providers, including behavioral health providers. DOD assessed contractor performance on all audited claims against the payment accuracy standards—which require payment error rates to not exceed between 2 and 1.75 percent, depending on the year of the contract—and took action when necessary. Across the audit reports from 2018 through 2023, claims from behavioral health providers made up between 1 and 8 percent of audited claims.

DOD's oversight actions were consistent with its oversight goal for early identification and resolution of performance issues, and with a recommended practice from the Office of Management and Budget and prior GAO work that federal agencies use multiple sources of evidence to support decision-making.

Why GAO Did This Study

To support military deployments and provide health care, including behavioral health care, DOD operates a health system known as TRICARE. This system offers behavioral health and other services to over nine million eligible beneficiaries in military hospitals and clinics, or through authorized civilian providers in the private sector.

The Conference Report 118-301 accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 includes a provision for GAO to report on TRICARE's payments to civilian network behavioral health providers. This report examines (1) the timeliness of TRICARE claims processing and (2) DOD's oversight of payment accuracy to all civilian providers, including behavioral health providers.

GAO reviewed relevant documents, such as DOD and contractor reports for timeliness and accuracy, and DOD's oversight plans for the TRICARE contracts. GAO also analyzed time frames for processing claims from behavioral health providers from 2018 through 2023 and audit findings on payment accuracy. Finally, GAO interviewed DOD officials with oversight responsibilities of TRICARE's contractors, contractor staff, and four selected behavioral health provider groups who participate in TRICARE. GAO compared DOD's oversight activities to a DOD goal and a recommended practice.

I haven’t gotten paid either; LPC in TX. I haven’t made phone calls to my republican reps office or called triwest. Yesterday there were a flurry of emails until I got an email from someone helpful! She said she’s checking with PGBA to see where my payments are going. Availity shows Paid claims and check numbers but zero payments have come to me. I get paid just fine thru triwest for CCN VA clients. Here’s their info; hope it helps. 🙂

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022.
“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt.
“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care–it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said.
Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health.","SAN DIEGO (May 12, 2025) – Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the expansion of its 1 West inpatient mental health ward—an initiative that marks a significant step forward in strengthening behavioral health care for active-duty service members, veterans, and beneficiaries.

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022. Through a coordinated vision shared among leadership, clinical departments, facilities staff, and safety experts, the project was brought to life with the goal of increasing access, improving therapeutic outcomes, and reinforcing the Navy’s commitment to warfighter readiness.

""When our service members are struggling, it affects not only their individual readiness but the collective strength of our force,"" said Rear Adm. Guido Valdes, Commander, Naval Medical Forces Pacific, and Director, Defense Health Network Pacific Rim. ""By delivering high-quality, evidence-based mental health services in a secure and supportive environment, this unit will ensure our warfighters receive the care they need to recover and return to duty—or transition with dignity to the next phase of their lives.""

The newly expanded 1 West ward moves NMCSD closer to its goal of increasing capacity from a historic 36-bed limit across the 1 North and 1 West units to a total of 48 beds by the end of the calendar year. The initiative is expected to eliminate active-duty disengagements to civilian care, improve engagement with veterans and beneficiaries, and generate an estimated $22.7 million in annual purchased care savings once all 24 new beds are staffed and in use.

“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt. Elizabeth Adriano, Director of NMCSD. “By retaining our service members in a military treatment facility, we preserve readiness, reduce costly external placements, and expand care access to those who have served and continue to serve.”

The original 1 West ward was last renovated in 2008, primarily to meet updated safety requirements. The current expansion project not only reinforces safety standards with structural upgrades—including ligature-resistant door hardware, lock replacements, and improved CCTV—but also places a strong emphasis on enhancing the therapeutic environment. Patients now benefit from access to a large outdoor courtyard, greater privacy, and improved treatment areas that support individualized care.

Additionally, the Program of Care has been refined to offer tailored therapeutic experiences, aligning treatment groups and clinical interventions with each patient’s specific diagnosis and symptom profile.

“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care–it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said. Cmdr. Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health. ""In addition, the expansion allows us to accept and treat a more diverse group of patients, which directly serves our multiple training programs, including the Navy’s largest psychiatric residency.”

The project’s success was the result of a joint plan of action and milestones (POAM) developed by the Directorate for Mental Health and the Directorate of Nursing Services, encompassing hiring initiatives, infrastructure improvements, space reorganization, and key procurement milestones.

The ribbon-cutting event highlighted the collective dedication and vision of the NMCSD team to deliver high-quality, mission-aligned behavioral health services that preserve the force, support families, and promote holistic well-being.

The mission of NMCSD is to provide a superior experience for our patients, staff, and warfighters. NMCSD employs more than 5,000 active-duty military personnel, civilians, and contractors in Southern California to deliver exceptional care afloat and ashore.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9031550/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-13 07:56:23.156331

Meet Adrian De-Heer

Adrian, 69 years-young, lives with his wife Ingrid at TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Community and they love it!

“TriCare Compton Gardens in Aspley, Brisbane is like a Dutch village from my childhood—compact (but adequate) homes, close to everywhere and everything, convenient, near the bus-stop, with no-one ever complaining,” Adrian said.

“Indeed, the people are very friendly!”

“We always said we would never live in one of those villages where the homes are too big for our life stage—we want to travel overseas and visit our children and grandchildren, not worry about our house needing more work.”

Adrian left the Netherlands aged 26 with his wife, chasing their desire for warmth and the palm trees of the South Pacific.

“We left our Dutch village and emigrated without any real knowledge of what to expect.

We were running from the Cold War, the freezing weather, and economic downturn,” he said.

Adrian’s search first led to New Zealand—a country with temperate weather rather than heat, and far fewer tropical palm trees than he was expecting!

“We emigrated to New Zealand and found ourselves bunking in with another Dutch couple in a caravan in April at Hawke’s Bay and freezing every night,” Adrian said.

“We eventually found what we wanted in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia instead of New Zealand! But back then, there was no internet to search things up.”

Home At Last

Adrian and Ingrid finally settled in sunny, warm and tropical Brisbane and raised three children while owning and running a printing business which was sold 15 years ago.

“We had to be handy as well as resourceful in our printing business,” Adrian said.

“Running a business requires you have to get very good at finding fixes. Machines break down, parts break, and you have to find a way to fix them within your means.”

“I would say it kept me sharp and resourceful after all these years!”

Cyclone Alfred Blows In

As Cyclone Alfred approached the south-east Queensland coast the TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Village in Aspley Brisbane experienced some strong wind gusts.

When a particularly strong gust blew his neighbour, Michael’s fixed skylight right off, Adrian was able to come to the rescue!

“With a big hole in his roof, Michael was worried about internal water damage,” Adrian said.

He’d called the SES (State Emergency Service) but many people were needing SES assistance at that time.

With the cyclone looming closer the rain increased and Michael’s buckets and towels could not capture the water pouring inside.

Michael gave me a call to see if I could help and I thought, I have just the thing!”

Adrian then armed himself with a good ole’ Bunnings umbrella, braved the crazy winds and rain to reach Michael’s home and climbed a ladder to inspect the damage.

“Sure enough, the umbrella fit perfectly between the broken part of the skylight and was successful in keeping the rain out of Michael’s home,” Adrian said.

A Humble Hero

Adrian certainly didn’t expect to become a TriCare hero but he is chuffed that his quick thinking was able to save Michael’s cherished home in the retirement village from flooding!

He admitted at the time he didn’t think much of the heroic act.

“I was a little overwhelmed by the reaction—I know anyone else in our Village would have done the same to help out,” he said.

“I’m just glad that the Bunnings umbrella did its job until the SES team arrived to fix the roof.”

The Power of Community at Compton Gardens Retirement Living Village

A sense of community and helping others are important values for Adrian. It was a key factor in why he and Ingrid chose to move to the TriCare’s Retirement Living Community at Aspley village 18 months ago.

“Living at TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Community has been one of the best decisions we’ve made. From the moment we moved in, we felt embraced by the warm and welcoming community that truly feels like home, the fellowship is wonderful,” said Adrian.

“There are so many positives to retirement living—being part of a greater community and living with like-minded people is such a benefit.”

One of the standout features at Compton Gardens Retirement Living Community is the bustling social calendar and neighbourhood.

“There’s always something happening—from happy hours and games evenings to movie nights and monthly concerts featuring jazz bands and local school choirs.

“These events provide wonderful opportunities to connect with fellow residents and build lasting friendships. We’re certainly having a great time here,” said Adrian.

“From aqua aerobics classes to tai chi sessions, it’s great to have such a wide range of activities to help us maintain our health and independence… and keep us busy!”

However, one of Adrian’s favourite things to do these days is monitoring the weather and keeping an umbrella handy in case of an emergency!",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/05/1000002809-e1747110992909.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-13 04:56:20.423712

""If this is true - we will find any way possible to stop it,"" Hegseth responded to reports on the resumption of such treatments.","Per Reuters, the Pentagon has referred all questions about this change in policy to the Defense Health Agency, which has so far not responded to requests for clarification.

This comes after a recent decision by the US Supreme Court that allowed Trump's administration to enforce a ban on transgender people in the military.

The ruling allows armed forces to discharge existing transgender personnel and reject new recruits while legal disputes continue.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has commanded the removal of transgender troops who don't voluntarily leave by June 6.

The order was disclosed in a memo accessed by Reuters last week.

Officials said there are currently 4,240 active-duty and National Guard transgender personnel in the US military.

However, transgender rights advocates believe the number is much higher than what official estimates claim.

In January, Trump signed an executive order reversing a policy of his predecessor, Joe Biden.

The earlier policy had ensured transgender troops could serve openly in the military.

A Gallup poll in February had found 58% of Americans in favor of open service by transgender people in the military. However, it was a drop from 71% in 2019.

Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host known for his hardline stance on cultural issues, has been a vocal opponent of gender-affirming care for transgender troops.

Last month, he dismissed rumors about the Pentagon's plan to resume such treatments for service members.

This bill will not only improve continuity of care for military families—it will expand access to high-quality maternity care nationwide.
“Research shows that midwifery care provides equal or better care and outcomes compared to physician care on many fronts.
“Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives at freestanding birth centers stand ready to serve military families, but Tricare doesn’t currently reimburse for their care.","Submitted by Office of Rep. Marilyn Strickland.

Last week, on International Day of the Midwife, Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland (WA-10), reintroduced the Maternal and Infant Delivery: Wellness, and Integration with Vital Expertise Support (MIDWIVES) for Servicemembers Act.

U.S. Representatives Emily Randall (WA-06), Juan Ciscomani (AZ-06), and Jen Kiggans (VA-02) co-led the bipartisan midwifery legislation.

The bill would increase access to maternity care for servicemembers and their families by extending midwifery care to those enrolled in TRICARE through a 5-year pilot program. This legislation expands access to midwifery care and gives the Department of Defense the option to permanently expand coverage if the pilot program is successful.

“It is our job to support our servicemembers, and this includes providing help before, during and after childbirth,” said Strickland. “This bill expands midwifery care options, giving servicemembers and their families the care that they deserve.”

“As our troops and their families serve our nation, they deserve access to the very best care, especially if they are looking to start or expand their family,” said Ciscomani. “As a dad of six I can tell you, planning to welcome a child to your family is an exciting time. However, serving in the military or having a spouse in uniform can pose additional difficulties for mothers-to-be. This is why I once again joined Rep. Strickland in a bipartisan effort to expand access to midwifery care for military spouses and women in uniform who are enrolled in TRICARE to ensure they can receive the care they need.”

“Sexual and reproductive health care is essential, and we have a responsibility to ensure that service members and their families can access the care they deserve,” said Randall. “Expanding midwifery services through TRICARE is a critical step toward closing the dangerous gaps in maternal health care that too many people — especially those who serve our nation— are forced to navigate.”

“As a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, I know firsthand the importance of high-quality, accessible maternal care for our military families,” said Kiggans. “The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act is a commonsense, data-driven solution that expands care options under TRICARE, improves outcomes for mothers and babies, and helps reduce strain on military healthcare systems. I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to better support those who serve by delivering the care they and their families deserve.”

The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act is endorsed by: American Association of Birth Centers (AABC), American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM), Birth Center Equity (BCE), Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery (PICBM), True North Birth Center, and the National Partnership on Women and Families.

“As a retired military spouse, a mother who relied on TRICARE during my own pregnancies, and a midwife who has supported countless families, I know firsthand the unique challenges military families face. Being restationed—sometimes well into pregnancy—often means starting over and scrambling to find a new provider in areas already facing serious shortages. For the past year and a half, I’ve been advocating for a solution which has become The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act. Midwives provide safe, evidence-based, and compassionate care that meets families where they are. This bill will not only improve continuity of care for military families—it will expand access to high-quality maternity care nationwide. I’m deeply grateful to Representatives Strickland, Ciscomani, Randall, and all the supporters of this bill for recognizing the urgent need to better serve our nation’s heroes and their loved ones—no matter where duty takes them,” said Ashley Jones, Licensed Midwife and Executive Director of True North Birth Center please.

“The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act directly addresses a critical gap in maternity care for military families by expanding TRICARE to include all credentialed midwives. By recognizing Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives as authorized providers, this bill not only increases access to care, especially in underserved areas, but also affirms the right of military families to choose safe community-based care. With over half of U.S. birth centers staffed by CPMs, this legislation will dramatically expand access to midwifery-led birth center services. NACPM strongly supports this bill as a meaningful, evidence-based solution that honors the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of our nation’s servicemembers and their families,” said Cassaundra Jah, Executive Director of the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives.

“The National Partnership for Women & Families applauds the reintroduction of the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act, which would provide more care options for servicemembers, especially ones that reside in rural or maternity care shortage areas,” said Amani Echols, Senior Manager for Maternal & Infant Health at the National Partnership for Women & Families. “Research shows that midwifery care provides equal or better care and outcomes compared to physician care on many fronts. For example, midwifery care results in higher rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, higher rates of breastfeeding, higher satisfaction with care, and lower overall costs. Passage of the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act is an integral step towards improving maternal and infant health.”

“Expanding midwifery coverage for service members is a lasting investment in families,” says Leseliey Welch, Co-Founder and CEO of Birth Center Equity. “Evidence shows that the midwifery model of care leads to excellent outcomes including lower rates of interventions like cesarean sections and episiotomies, and increased patient satisfaction. Midwifery care also emphasizes a personalized, relationship-centered approach, fostering trust and empowerment for the birthing person.” With this bill, says Welch, “we hope that more and more service members will gain access to birth centers, the only health care facilities based in the midwifery model of care.”

“The American Association of Birth Centers is proud to support the Midwives for Servicemembers Act. Expanding coverage to include certified professional midwives and certified midwives will significantly improve access to midwifery-led birth center care. We commend Rep. Marilyn Strickland, Rep. Emily Randall, Rep. Juan Ciscomani, and Rep. Jen Kiggans for their leadership in advancing high-quality maternity care for our service members and their families,” said Trinisha Williams, President of AABC.

“Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives at freestanding birth centers stand ready to serve military families, but Tricare doesn’t currently reimburse for their care. The Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery is deeply grateful to Congresswoman Strickland for introducing the Midwives for Service Members Act, which would ensure these nationally certified providers are reimbursed. As military hospitals close maternity units and care deserts grow, midwives and birth centers are vital to filling the gap and ensuring military families aren’t left without options, said Mary Lawlor, CPM, Executive Director, Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery.”

“The American College of Nurse-Midwives urges policymakers to support the Midwives for Service Members Act to ensure that military families have access to the full range of high-quality maternity care options, including midwifery services. Expanding access to certified midwives and certified professional midwives within the Military Health System is a cost-effective, evidence-based strategy to improve maternal health outcomes, enhance patient satisfaction, and address longstanding disparities in access to care for those who serve our country,” said Michelle Munroe, retired Army Colonel, and CEO of the American College of Nurse-Midwives",https://thesubtimes.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/TST-Featured-Image.png,N,0.0,2025-05-12 22:56:19.242465

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

Breen,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/eleventh-circuit-addresses-rule-9b-heightened-pleading-standard-false-claims-act,"The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss.
Reliability and Falsity The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme.
With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge.
Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government.
As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has concluded that a successful False Claims Act (FCA) claim should “allege not just a scheme, but a scheme that actually led to false claims being submitted to the government”—and must do so with particularity.

This heightened pleading standard cost the qui tam relators in United States ex rel. Vargas v. Lincare, Inc. et al., 24-11080, 2025 WL 1122196 (11th Cir. Apr. 16, 2025), three out of the four claims in their fourth amended complaint. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida had dismissed the entire complaint for failing to plead sufficient facts under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) (“Rule 9(b)”).

The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss. The complaint alleged that the defendants, a medical supplier and its subsidiary, improperly coded the accessories (i.e., batteries, chargers, and cables) of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines as ventilator accessories. Ventilator accessories are covered by TRICARE, a health insurance program for military personnel and their families; CPAP accessories are not.

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of claims alleging: (1) the routine waiver of patient copays in violation of TRICARE conditions of participation; (2) automatic shipments of CPAP supplies, such as masks (TRICARE covers these supplies only upon a request); and (3) illegal kickbacks to employees of labs or medical offices who could choose which supplier was used.

“The most direct way to satisfy [Rule 9(b)] is by identifying specific claims submitted to the government: invoices, billing records, reimbursement forms,” wrote Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat. Alternative means (other than documentary proof) may satisfy Rule 9(b), the court noted, as long as the claim has “sufficient indicia of reliability”—a case-by-case determination.

Reliability and Falsity

The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme. The court rejected the defendants’ arguments that: (1) there were insufficient indicia of reliability to show that an actual claim was submitted, and (2) even if claims were submitted, they were not false. On these points, the court determined the following:

Reliability: The relators adequately alleged hands-on access to private records, including patient files, billing correspondence, and authorizations for payment—“the type of inside information that [is] sufficient at the pleading stage.” The relators identified specific claims (i.e., specific instances of upcoding), with dates, amounts, and billing codes.

Falsity: The relators adequately alleged that the coding practices were improper and the resulting claims were false. Though the defendants claimed that TRICARE allowed the substitute ventilator codes, this was a factual dispute and not grounds for dismissal, per the court.

Meanwhile, the relators identified no specific false claims submitted to TRICARE in connection with: (1) any co-pay waiver, (2) the auto-ship scheme involving CPAP replacement supplies, or (3) the alleged kickbacks.

No Shotgun Pleadings

In a separate concurrence, Judge Tjoflat called attention to a “foundational pleading defect that the District Court did not reach.” The relators’ fourth amended complaint, he noted, packed all four of the fraud claims described above into a single count—burdening the courts, defendants, and the appellate process.

“That is not how litigation works,” he wrote. “The fourth amended complaint is a shotgun pleading—something we have condemned time and time again. It…forces courts to play detective rather than umpire.”

Shotgun pleadings, the judge stated, run counter to Rule 8 (requiring statements in a claim to be “short and plain,” with allegations that are “simple, concise, and direct”) and Rule 10 (requiring each claim founding on a separate transaction or occurrence to be stated in a separate count, “if doing so would promote clarity”). When confronted with a shotgun complaint, he said, a defendant should move for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). And a district court should sua sponte strike it—“early and firmly.”

Takeaways

The Vargas decision offers clarity in the Eleventh Circuit on the rigorous application of the Rule 9(b) “reliable indicia” standard in the FCA context. With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge. Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government. Failure to do so is likely to result in dismissal. As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

That means if you’re an active-duty service member with Tricare insurance, you can get high-quality, evidence-based addiction treatment without worrying about sky-high out-of-pocket costs. It’s real help, and it’s finally more accessible.

Why This Matters for Military Members

Let’s be honest—military life is demanding. The stress, the deployments, the constant readiness… it’s a lot. And for many service members, alcohol becomes a coping mechanism. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 1 in 3 active-duty personnel engages in binge drinking, and heavy alcohol use is even more common in the military than in the general population. It’s a serious issue that can lead to physical health problems, strained relationships, and even career setbacks.

That’s where treatment comes in—and why it’s so important that it’s the right kind of treatment.

What You Can Expect at Ona Treatment Center

Since they’re Tricare-approved, Ona Treatment Center is fully equipped to offer a wide range of addiction services covered by your insurance. That includes:

Medical detox to help you safely and comfortably stop drinking

Inpatient rehab with 24/7 care in a structured environment

Outpatient programs if you want to stay at home while getting treatment

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with options like naltrexone to reduce cravings

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and counseling to help change the way you think about drinking

Family therapy and support programs to bring your loved ones into your recovery process

Dual diagnosis treatment if you’re also dealing with mental health challenges like PTSD or anxiety

The team at Ona knows this isn’t just about stopping drinking—it’s about getting your life back, rebuilding your confidence, and learning how to thrive without alcohol. And they’re here to walk with you through it.

Getting Started Is Easier Than You Think

If you’ve got Tricare, you’re already halfway there. You may need a referral depending on your plan, but once that’s in place, you can get started at Ona Treatment Center with most or all of your costs covered. That’s a huge relief, especially when finances are tight or you’re trying to support a family.

You Deserve Support—So Take It

Loura Javier, surgical technician, 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage, Alaska, is leading a groundbreaking training partnership between JBER and Alaska Native Medical Center, a 182-bed, level 2 trauma hospital in Anchorage, Alaska.

Javier designed and launched a rotational training program that places one Defense Health Agency surgical technologist at a time into ANMC’s 11-suite operating room department for a month-long immersive experience.

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts.

“This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees.

“Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

[Click here for information about joining the class action]

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex also revealed that Tricare, the healthcare program for uniformed service members that ""currently represents approximately 20-25% of [the Company's] annual revenue"", ""has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

SPRING HILL, Tenn., May 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Family Care Center, a leading provider of outpatient behavioral health services, proudly announces the opening of its newest clinic in Spring Hill, Tennessee. This expansion marks the organization's ninth location in the state and reinforces its commitment to addressing the urgent and growing demand for accessible, high-quality mental health care.

Mental health needs are growing nationwide, and in Tennessee, access remains a major concern, with the state ranking 43rd in the nation. Family Care Center's newest clinic is designed to help close that gap by offering timely, comprehensive treatment options for a wide range of mental health concerns.

""Opening this clinic in Spring Hill is a vital step in ensuring that individuals facing anxiety, depression, or other challenges can access the personalized, life-changing care they deserve,"" said Dr. Chris Ivany, CEO of Family Care Center. ""Our approach combines compassionate support with clinically proven treatments, helping individuals navigate their mental health journey with confidence.""

Family Care Center provides a variety of evidence-based treatments for patients of all ages, including individual and family therapy, psychiatric care, medication management, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)—an FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment for depression, OCD, and other conditions that haven't responded to traditional therapies.

""Our goal is to create a safe, supportive space where individuals can access the tools and care they need to achieve lasting wellness,"" said David Wood, Regional Director for Family Care Center in Tennessee. ""Patients can see their therapist, psychologist, and other providers in one convenient location, with appointments available in days, not months.""

This patient-centered, integrated model isn't just more convenient—it works. Family Care Center consistently delivers outcomes that exceed national benchmarks.

85.5% of patients treated for depression report significant symptom reduction within six months

86.1% of patients treated for anxiety experience similar improvement

The Spring Hill clinic accepts most major insurance plans in Tennessee, including Aetna, Ascension, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Tricare, and others, making high-quality care more accessible and affordable for all.

To schedule an appointment or learn more about the Spring Hill clinic, visit www.fccwellbeing.com or call (888) 374-5066.

Family Care Center is a national leader in mental health services, dedicated to positively impacting the well-being of local communities. Their top-rated, multi-specialty clinicians deliver comprehensive, evidence-based care, providing positive outcomes for patients of all ages. In addition to therapy and psychiatric services, they are at the forefront of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), an innovative treatment for depression and more. Family Care Center is one of the fastest-growing mental health care providers in the U.S, providing patient care, conducting research and offering continuing medical education in their field. With over 40 locations across Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Tennessee and Texas, they continue to expand nationally in collaboration with Revelstoke Capital Partners.
