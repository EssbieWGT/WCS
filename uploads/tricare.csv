KCCHC provides accessible, affordable care close to home and wants military families to know that essential services are available through TRICARE.

“Serving our military families is a privilege,” said Shauna Schacht, Chief Executive Officer of Knox County Community Health Center. “By accepting TRICARE, we want our local service members and their families to know that their health and well-being matter here.

“Our team is committed to providing care that supports them right in their own community.”

Military families often face unique challenges such as deployments, relocations, and added stress.

By accepting TRICARE, KCCHC helps reduce barriers to care and ensures that service members and their loved ones can access essential services without traveling outside the community.

TRICARE provides comprehensive coverage worldwide, including health plans, special programs, prescriptions, and dental care. Most plans meet minimum essential coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

At KCCHC, TRICARE covers primary care, mental health and PTSD support, substance use counseling and Narcan distribution, and vaccinations including flu, COVID 19, and shingles.

If a service is not offered at KCCHC or transportation is a challenge, Knox County Mobility Management (KCMM) can help. KCMM works to reduce barriers to care by connecting residents including veterans, older adults, individuals with disabilities, and lower income residents to the most appropriate transportation resources.

Options include public transit, private operators, volunteer drivers, cycling, and walking. KCMM does not provide rides directly but helps identify the best option for everyone.

Appointments at KCCHC can be scheduled by calling 740-399-8008. For transportation assistance through KCMM, call 740-392-2200 ext.2218.

Prosecutors say Adelle Starin operated the store, selling baby products and toys. The 41-year-old Sartell woman submitted false claims for reimbursement to the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program, TRICARE, which initially paid out the claims. When TRICARE began rejecting her claims, Starin created a fictitious company called Sunshine Medical LLC. She falsely represented to two lenders, Liquid Capital Enterprises Corp. and Slope Tech Inc., saying she needed financing to buy supplies for her store from a place called Sunshine Medical, which was a shell company. To collect the cash, Starin created fake invoices from Sunshine Medical and sent them via interstate wire transfers.

In December, Starin pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of wire fraud. In addition to the prison sentence, she must also serve three years of supervised release and pay $2.35 million in restitution.

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard.
Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.
“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate.
So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.” As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?","Jennifer Barnhill is a columnist for Military.com writing about military families.

Despite making headlines for helping after the catastrophic flooding in Texas or being politicized as President Donald Trump deploys it to police U.S. cities, the National Guard remains a mystery to both civilians and the active-duty force. However, as our nation increasingly calls upon the Guard, we need to better understand our “always ready” force, or it may not be ready when we need it.

“I was going to pick up a prescription that I needed, and they were like, ‘Your insurance isn't working’. And I was like, ‘What do you mean it's not working? It's Tricare,” said Emily Schmidt, whose spouse flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Maryland National Guard. They started by calling Tricare, who directed them to the personnel database, the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, where staff told them they couldn’t help because his unit hadn't processed his orders properly.

Schmidt’s family was dropped from Tricare insurance because his new orders hadn’t been added to the system correctly, a particularly onerous issue for Guardsmen because their status and orders change regularly, causing them to have to pay out of pocket for medications during these transitions.

Despite representing 21% of the Defense Department’s total military force and more than 34% of the Army as of 2023, the challenges faced by those in the Guard are less visible, and often complicated. Unlike active-duty troops, who receive all their orders from the federal government, National Guard orders typically come directly from the governor of the state where they are assigned. Guardsmen get to “homestead,” but if they live far from their assigned state, they may find themselves away from available resources. They also have to balance the demands of working for a civilian employer, the state and the federal government when called upon to serve under federal orders.

There are three main types of National Guard duty statuses:

Title 10 – Federal control and funding, used for overseas deployments, combat operations, or other federal missions; eligible for full federal benefits and subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Title 32 – State control but federally funded; covers drills, annual training, homeland defense missions, and full-time Guard roles; federal benefits apply.

State Active Duty – State control and funding; used for state missions like disaster relief; state benefits only, not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.

The complex set of statuses gets further complicated by the irregular nature of Guard funding.

“They'll say, ‘We're going to hire you for a year, but your orders are not cut for the year because of the way money is dispersed,” said Lainey Crown, National Guard spouse and mental health clinician/licensed professional clinical counselor. “Every time you get put on these new orders, somebody has to go in and push a button to say that you're eligible for Tricare. But that does not always happen.”

The Crown family had a six-day lapse in coverage, during which time one of their kids needed to have surgery. A few months later, they received a $20,000 bill. While the error was eventually corrected, it was not easy to identify who was the right person to fix the problem.

“There have been times if Patrick were to be in a car accident and killed today, and I would have to notify his unit, I don't know who to call,” said Crown, referring to her husband.

Because families can live anywhere, Crown has lived in North Carolina, Georgia and now Kentucky, while her spouse worked for the Maryland and now Alabama Army National Guard units. As a result, Crown has found herself far from available resources and, because they didn’t live near their unit, she did not know who to call for help when paperwork was not processed properly.

“The problem with it stopping and starting again is usually – and I'd say at least half the time – there's an error,” said Hope Daupert, who was named the 2025 AFI National Guard Spouse of the Year for her work educating Guardsmen about accessing life insurance, another area where lapses can occur due to changing statuses. “I think at this point, everybody's just so used to it. Nobody really complains about it anymore.”

Those potential lapses may have an impact on military readiness, according to advocates.

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard. “The more that we use the National Guard, the more we're going to have to think about these benefits.”

NGAUS is one of the organizations that has aggressively advocated for military families. It has supported the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that would give Guardsmen and reservists “premium-free/zero cost sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for Tricare Reserve Select (TRS).” The legislation would also allow Guardsmen to purchase care for family members, reducing gaps in coverage.

“When service members sign up to serve their country, it’s our duty to support them. That includes providing access to comprehensive health care,” said one of the bill’s co-sponsors, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in an email to Military.com. “Extending Tricare to all service members not only does right by our troops and their families, it also is a common-sense investment in our military readiness.”

The legislation would do more than minimize gaps in coverage: It seeks to improve readiness.

According to NGAUS, an estimated 130,000 Guardsmen and reservists are currently without health care.

“A lot of times, they wait to go on orders so that they can fix any health issues free of charge,” said Plamann. When deployment notices are as short as 24 hours, these Guardsmen aren’t physically prepared to deploy. “Our medical readiness numbers for our units are very low.”

Plamann said that some version of this legislation has been proposed annually for the past 10 years, but has not seen progress in Congress. Plamann believes there is hesitation due to the costs involved. “To give National Guard and reserve health care coverage annually would cost about $700 million,” she said. This would amount to roughly .07 percent of the proposed $925 billion military budget. ""For how much the nation relies upon the Guard, that's worth it.”

But cost may not be the only obstacle. Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.

At the same time, Guardsmen and their families are more and more in the political crosshairs.

The National Guard has been increasingly called upon by Trump, sometimes in more common natural disaster response roles, as in their activation after the recent floods in Texas, but also for what are seen as politically motivated reasons, like being mobilized to Los Angeles following protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the more recent mobilization to Washington, D.C.

“People are so emotional about it that they don't see the person or the families behind it,” said Schmidt. “The service member might not agree with the things that are happening, but they still have a duty. … They still have a responsibility [to follow orders].”

If they are in the crosshairs nationally, Guardsmen are seen differently locally.

“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate. “We're able to have our homes in the places that we've grown up. … I live a block away from my parents.” This sense of community isn’t just felt by the families; Guardsmen experience it too.

Deady recalls when her husband’s Guard unit came to the aid of their local community after tornadoes demolished buildings and homes in their Ohio town. “Within two hours of confirmation, our guys were on site, with our heavy equipment, with everything. So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.”

As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?

Instead of accepting system failure as the status quo and blaming Guardsmen for the actions of politicians, we should be asking how we can improve National Guard quality of life, just as we did for active-duty families. We are all part of the military.

""For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.
Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.
That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.
""We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,"" he said.","The following information was released by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS):

Introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the Healthcare for Our Troops Act (S. 2575) would offer premium-free, zero-cost-share medical coverage to every member of the Guard and Reserve through TRICARE, the military's health insurance program.

About 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists currently have no medical coverage. Hundreds of thousands more pay for their own coverage or rely on employer-provided health insurance.

Baldwin spoke at the 147th General Conference and Exhibition on Saturday in Milwaukee, where she received the NGAUS Harry S. Truman Award, the association's highest honor.

""We've fallen short in a pretty crucial area and that is basic health care,"" she told attendees. ""I believe that's morally wrong. It's bad for preparedness and readiness. And yes, we need to change it.""

""Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access,"" said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president. ""For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.

""Our Guardsmen need this, and our nation needs them,"" he added. ""I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.""

Current law provides coverage to part-time Guardsmen and Reservists only when they are federally mobilized on orders for more than 30 days. Most of the Guard's domestic missions are of a shorter duration. Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.

In addition, Guardsmen must also be medically ready to respond to the state or nation with little to no notice. This can be challenging for the almost one in five who have no private coverage and lack access to routine, preventive health care, McGinn added.

Zero-cost TRICARE is a top NGAUS legislative priority.

Both the House and Senate have considered legislation to expand medical coverage to part-time service members in recent years. Major legislation such as this often requires several years to win congressional approval.

S. 2575 would enroll Guardsmen and Reservists into TRICARE Reserve Select at no cost.

TRS is currently a partially subsidized program for drilling Guardsmen and Reservists. They cover a monthly premium and co-pays for services. The legislation would eliminate all those costs.

That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.

""We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,"" he said. ""We need to view Guard Soldiers and Airmen in the same light.""",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-29 12:56:19.349779

While TRICARE Prime is only available to eligible beneficiaries in Prime Service Areas (designated regions that have proximity to military hospitals or clinics), TPR extends coverage beyond PSAs. This plan helps active duty service members and their family members get care when they live or work in areas that are remote from military hospitals or clinics.

“TPR helps you get high-quality care, wherever you are,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “TRICARE is committed to supporting you and your family, wherever you’re called to serve.”

Q: Who can enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote?

A: TPR is for service members who:

Are on active duty, OR

Are in the National Guard or Reserve on active duty for more than 30 days, AND

Live and work more than 50 miles (or one hour’s drive) from a military hospital or clinic

TPR is for active duty family members who live:

With a sponsor enrolled in TPR, OR

With a sponsor who gets care at a small military clinic that doesn’t have space to see family members, OR

In areas remote from a military hospital or clinic with National Guard or Reserve members called to active duty for 30 days or more

If your sponsor deploys, you can still enroll in TPR for up to 90 days after their deployment date.

Not sure if TPR is available? Check the Plan Finder tool or contact your regional contractor.

Q: Why choose TPR?

A: With TPR, you don’t pay enrollment fees. You have the same coverage as TRICARE Prime. You pay nothing for health care when you see your primary care manager or use a referral to see a network provider.

Q: How do I get care?

A: With TPR, you’ll have a PCM who takes care of most of your health needs. Your PCM might be:

A provider in the TRICARE network, if one is nearby

Any TRICARE-authorized provider, if no network PCMs are available

Your PCM will:

Refer you to specialists when needed

Work with TRICARE for approvals

Help find network specialists

File your claims

Q: What are my costs?

A: If you follow the rules for getting care with your TPR plan, you can lower your costs. There are no out-of-pocket costs for covered services. (Note: If you get care without a referral, you may have to pay point-of-service fees.)

You’ll have copayments for prescriptions filled through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.

Q: How do I choose the right plan for me?

A: When picking a health plan:

Compare TPR with other TRICARE health plans.

Think about other health insurance you might have.

Consider how far you live from the nearest military hospital or clinic.

If you’re a qualifying ADFM, you may be eligible for reimbursement for travel costs under the Prime Travel Benefit.

Q: How do I enroll?

A: To enroll in TPR:

Check if TPR is available using the Plan Finder.

Call your regional contractor.

ADSMs must wait until they reach their duty station before enrolling in TPR.

Q: What is TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas?

A: If you serve overseas in a remote location, check out TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas. TPR Overseas is a managed care option in several overseas locations in Eurasia-Africa, Latin America and Canada, and the Pacific. It’s only available to ADSMs, their command-sponsored family members, and activated NGR members, as described in the TRICARE Plans Overview Fact Sheet.

Note that when you enroll in TPR Overseas, you have access to an overseas point of contact. TPR Overseas POCs can help with scheduling appointments, filing claims, and more. You can call your TRICARE Area Office to connect with an overseas POC.

Knowing the operations status of Andrews before, during and after a storm is crucial for safety and mission readiness. The base communicates updates in several ways, and all personnel, families and mission partners are encouraged to stay connected through official channels, such as the base website (www.jba.af.mil) and the JBA Connect App. People are also encouraged to subscribe to emergency alerts from the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center.

Hurricane Erin became the first major hurricane of the season when it formed Aug. 11, 2025, and while it didn’t make landfall, it did have minor impacts as it traveled north along the East Coast. The hurricane reached a peak of Category 5 on Aug. 16 before weakening to Category 1 on Aug. 22 as it went past the coast of North Carolina.

When hurricanes are forecast to impact the area, base personnel should monitor weather updates closely and be ready to act. This may include securing outdoor property, adjusting travel plans, or preparing for shelter-in-place orders. If ordered to evacuate, follow instructions from local authorities and leadership promptly.

During an emergency, people may to need to survive rely on their own supplies for several days, and a kit with food, water and other supplies with basic household items would be ideal. According to ready.gov, a basic kit includes:

Water

Food

Battery-powered or hand-crank radio and a NOAA weather radio with tone alert

Flashlight

First aid kit

Extra batteries

Whistle (to signal for help)

Dust mask (to filter contaminated air)

Plastic sheeting, scissors and duct tape (to shelter in place)

Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)

Wrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)

Manual can opener

Local maps

Cell phone with chargers and backup battery

Consider keeping smaller, portable kits in your vehicle and workplace in case you are away from home when an emergency occurs. Review and refresh your go kit every six months to ensure supplies are current and functional.

Personal preparedness reduces the strain on emergency responders and ensures that you and your family can weather disruptions safely. By assembling a go kit and staying connected to official Andrews information channels, you will be better prepared to respond quickly and effectively when storms approach.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9182400/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-29 14:56:20.644886

With a sponsor enrolled in TPR, OR

With a sponsor who gets care at a small military clinic that doesn’t have space to see family members, OR

In areas remote from a military hospital or clinic with National Guard or Reserve members called to active duty for 30 days or more

If your sponsor deploys, you can still enroll in TPR for up to 90 days after their deployment date.

Not sure if TPR is available? Check the Plan Finder tool or contact your regional contractor.

Q: Why choose TPR?

A: With TPR, you don’t pay enrollment fees. You have the same coverage as TRICARE Prime. You pay nothing for health care when you see your primary care manager or use a referral to see a network provider.

Q: How do I get care?

A: With TPR, you’ll have a PCM who takes care of most of your health needs. Your PCM might be:

A provider in the TRICARE network, if one is nearby

Any TRICARE-authorized provider, if no network PCMs are available

Your PCM will:

Refer you to specialists when needed

Work with TRICARE for approvals

Help find network specialists

File your claims

Q: What are my costs?

A: If you follow the rules for getting care with your TPR plan, you can lower your costs. There are no out-of-pocket costs for covered services. (Note: If you get care without a referral, you may have to pay point-of-service fees.)

You’ll have copayments for prescriptions filled through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.

Q: How do I choose the right plan for me?

A: When picking a health plan:

Compare TPR with other TRICARE health plans.

Organized by the MCP Working Group, the summit brought together leaders from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Health Affairs, and the Defense Health Agency, alongside representatives from more than 20 partnered civilian centers. The event focused on sharing policy updates, exchanging lessons learned, and aligning partnerships with operational readiness to ensure a strong return on investment—both now and in the future.

Jonathan Woodson, MD, MSS, FACS, president of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, opened the summit with a keynote address. He highlighted the critical role of partnerships in sustaining readiness, not only for individual military providers but also in bolstering national disaster response through the National Disaster Medical System.

Throughout the summit, partners from across the country shared insights on topics such as tracking clinical experience for providers, nurses, and medics; establishing offices for military-civilian integration; and embedding active duty personnel in partner programs. Captain Matthew Tadlock, MD, FACS, USN, ESS president, led a dedicated session spotlighting the wide range of partnership models—from fully embedded physicians or surgical teams to enlisted-only just-in-time training, rotating surgical teams, and rotating special operations medics at regular intervals—demonstrating that while implementation may vary, all efforts aim to improve combat casualty care.

An important panel, “Integrating General Surgeons into Your Trauma Program,” featured representatives from the Air Force’s Centers for the Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills (CSTARS) in St. Louis, Missouri, and Cincinnati, Ohio, as well as the Navy’s Expeditionary Resuscitative Surgical System embedded in Chicago, Illinois. Most forward surgical Role II capabilities across the services have general surgeons on their teams. These surgeons embedded in trauma-specific MCPs need to be ready for a combat casualty care mission, but also need to maintain their general surgery skillset. Panelists emphasized the critical role of general surgeons in trauma teams, while highlighting the value of emergency general surgery and elective clinical opportunities for maintaining both deployment readiness and surgical proficiency as general surgeons.

Immediate ESS Past-President Colonel Jennifer Gurney, MD, FACS, Chief of the Joint Trauma System (JTS), emphasized the necessity of a globally integrated approach to trauma care, highlighting how partnerships are instrumental to that vision. Colonel (Retired) Brian Eastridge, MD, FACS, US Army, Medical Director of the ACS Military Health System Strategic Partnership, discussed applying similar systems-level approaches at national and regional levels through integrated military and civilian efforts. Colonel Sarady Tan, MD, representing Health Affairs, provided a timely update on the MISSION ZERO Act, which offers federal funding opportunities to sustain qualifying military-civilian partnerships. This initiative helps ensure continuous access to trauma care while maintaining provider readiness.

The summit laid the foundation for a growing community of partnerships united by a shared mission. By mentoring newer sites and speaking with a unified voice, these collaborations can advance military medical readiness and national disaster preparedness.

If you’re a military member, reservist, or family member covered by Tricare insurance, finding a Tricare-approved psychiatrist for mental health treatment is crucial. At Advanced TMS Clinic in Lemon Grove, we are proud to be an in-network provider with Tricare, offering specialized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy for conditions like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other treatment-resistant mood disorders. Our dedicated team ensures that you receive compassionate, effective, and accessible mental health care tailored to your needs.

Why Choose a Tricare-Approved Psychiatrist?

Tricare insurance provides comprehensive coverage for active duty military personnel, reservists, and their families, including mental health services. By choosing a Tricare-approved psychiatrist at Advanced TMS Clinic, you can access cutting-edge TMS therapy with the confidence that your treatment is covered under your Tricare plan, reducing out-of-pocket costs and simplifying the process. Our team works closely with Tricare to verify benefits and ensure seamless access to care.

Benefits of Choosing Advanced TMS Clinic

In-Network with Tricare: As a Tricare-approved provider, we streamline the insurance process, making TMS therapy accessible for qualifying conditions.

Specialized Care for Military Communities: We understand the unique mental health challenges faced by service members and their families, offering stigma-free, compassionate treatment.

FDA-Approved TMS Therapy: TMS is a non-invasive, drug-free treatment that targets depression and other mood disorders, ideal for those who haven’t found relief with traditional medications.

Personalized Treatment Plans: Our experienced psychiatrists create tailored plans to address your specific mental health needs.

What is TMS Therapy?

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain responsible for mood regulation. Unlike antidepressants, which rely on systemic medication delivery, TMS directly targets underactive brain regions to “wake up” dormant synapses, helping alleviate symptoms of depression and other mood disorders.

At Advanced TMS Clinic, we use NeuroStar Advanced TMS, a proven therapy with over 5.6 million treatments performed and an 83% response rate in real-world studies. For military personnel and their families dealing with treatment-resistant depression, TMS offers a safe and effective alternative without the common side effects of medications, such as weight gain or fatigue.

Why Military Personnel and Families Trust Advanced TMS Clinic

Military life comes with unique stressors, and mental health challenges like depression or anxiety can be particularly prevalent. At Advanced TMS Clinic, our Tricare-approved psychiatrists are committed to supporting the military community by providing:

Expert Care: Our team includes experienced psychiatrists and clinicians trained in TMS therapy.

Convenient Access: We verify Tricare benefits upfront to ensure coverage and minimize costs.

Proven Results: Clinical data shows that 62% of patients who complete a NeuroStar TMS treatment cycle achieve remission from depression symptoms.

No Sedation or Recovery Time: TMS sessions are relaxing, with minimal discomfort and no need for anesthesia.

How to Access TMS Therapy with Tricare

Getting started with TMS therapy at Advanced TMS Clinic is simple:

Verify Benefits: Contact our team to confirm your Tricare coverage for TMS therapy.

Schedule a Consultation: Meet with our Tricare-approved psychiatrist to assess if TMS is right for you.

Personalized Treatment: If eligible, we’ll develop a customized TMS treatment plan to address your mental health needs.

Most Tricare plans cover TMS therapy for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) if you’ve tried at least two antidepressant medications without sufficient relief. Our team will guide you through the eligibility process and handle insurance coordination.

Additional Support for Veterans

In addition to Tricare, Advanced TMS Clinic partners with TriWest and the Veterans Affairs (VA) system to provide TMS therapy for veterans. Through TriWest’s administration of the VA’s Community Care Program, veterans can access our services under their VA benefits. Our facility is approved to offer TMS therapy, ensuring veterans receive the care they deserve.

Berst said, “We have a complicated mission, supporting our combatant command partners, our military service partners, and more.
But forums such as DHITS help ensure we can bring the best of the military, government, industry, and academia together to deliver on that mission.” Military health leaders also discussed the operational impact of technology.
Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said, “We’re focused on a mission that cuts across so many sectors, delivering smarter, integrated, data-driven health care for service members and their families.” Data, Ferrara explained, is at the heart of this digital transformation.
Ferrara called for building a digitally enabled, globally connected system of readiness and health care that allows deployed medics to consult with specialists anywhere in the world instantly.","With the theme of “Empowering Care, Enhancing Readiness: Harnessing Health IT Innovation,” the 2025 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium kicked off in Nashville, Tennessee, with Pat Flanders, chief information officer for the Defense Health Agency, addressing more than 2,300 attendees Aug. 26.

Besides his role as the DHA CIO, Flanders oversees the DHA Program Executive Office, Medical Systems, which strengthens the DHA by enabling the use of resource data to make better-informed decisions, implementing enhanced cybersecurity protections, and improving fiscal auditability.

Flanders described how his team is “responsible for ensuring the products and services under its purview enable combat support in competition, crisis, and conflict, and ensure the full continuum of health delivery from the foxhole to the home front.”

DHA’s information technology enterprise leverages the strength and sophistication of a unified network—the Medical Community of Interest—and legacy systems to support DHA’s mission as a combat support agency by ensuring a reliable IT infrastructure worldwide for its military hospitals and clinics, as well as the 9.5 million beneficiaries DHA supports. Flanders said his various divisions do this by:

Protecting and securing the medical network and data by meeting Department of Defense cybersecurity requirements

Facilitating continuous support to DHA’s clinical care enterprise

Aligning resources to modernize the DHA IT infrastructure with the work of DOD chief information officers and other DOD agencies

Driving financial auditability compliance

The symposium provides an opportunity to share knowledge and innovative ideas, discuss lessons learned, and introduce new developments that enhance the military healthcare delivery system.

Kathleen Berst, acting DHA assistant director for support and component acquisition executive, talked about how the DHA supports mission readiness by “rethinking the way we’re doing business,” and how the DHA needs to leverage partnerships to modernize military health.

Berst said, “We have a complicated mission, supporting our combatant command partners, our military service partners, and more. But forums such as DHITS help ensure we can bring the best of the military, government, industry, and academia together to deliver on that mission.”

Military health leaders also discussed the operational impact of technology. Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said, “We’re focused on a mission that cuts across so many sectors, delivering smarter, integrated, data-driven health care for service members and their families.”

Data, Ferrara explained, is at the heart of this digital transformation. “The point here isn’t simply about having data. It’s about building systems that translate data into insight and actions so that we can deliver better outcomes at the point of care and across the continuum,” he said. Ferrara called for building a digitally enabled, globally connected system of readiness and health care that allows deployed medics to consult with specialists anywhere in the world instantly. “This is a future in which data is no longer a barrier, but a bridge,” he said.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/DHITS-2025/9283620.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-28 22:56:29.867850

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad.
In recent years, Guardsmen have responded to hurricanes, floods, wildfires, civil disturbances, border crossings and even the worst public health crisis in a century without medical coverage, McGinn said.
That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.
“We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,” he said.","Almost one in five members of the Guard and Reserve has no health insurance

WASHINGTON, D.C. (Aug. 28, 2025) — The voice of current and former National Guard officers nationwide is applauding a Senate bill that would ensure that every member of the National Guard and Reserves has access to health care.

Introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the Healthcare for Our Troops Act (S. 2575) would offer premium-free, zero-cost-share medical coverage to every Guardsman and Reservist through TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program.

Currently, about 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists have no medical coverage, according to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon. Hundreds of thousands more pay for their own coverage or rely on employer-provided health insurance.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president.

“Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access,” McGinn added. “For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component. Our Guardsmen need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

Current law provides coverage to part-time Guardsmen and Reservists only when they are federally mobilized on orders for more than 30 days. Most of the Guard’s domestic missions are of a shorter duration. Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.

In recent years, Guardsmen have responded to hurricanes, floods, wildfires, civil disturbances, border crossings and even the worst public health crisis in a century without medical coverage, McGinn said.

In addition, Guardsmen must also be medically ready to respond to the state or nation with little to no notice. This can be challenging for the almost one in five who have no private coverage and lack access to routine, preventive health care, McGinn added.

S. 2575 would also enable Guardsmen and Reservists to complete annual medical readiness requirements with their preferred civilian provider — giving commanders back valuable training days and saving more than $162 million annually in contracted medical assessments.

The legislation fixes all that by enrolling Guardsmen and Reservists into TRICARE Reserve Select at no cost.

TRS is currently a partially subsidized program for drilling Guardsmen and Reservists. They cover a monthly premium and co-pays for services. The legislation would eliminate all of those costs for participants.

That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.

“We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,” he said. “We need to view Guard Soldiers and Airmen in the same light.

“This legislation would also provide the Guard with a game-changing recruiting and retention tool, which would go a long way toward paying for the coverage,” he added. “And it will make our Soldiers and Airmen more attractive in the civilian job market. It’s the right thing to do for the Guard and the nation.”

Besides his role as the DHA CIO, Flanders oversees the DHA Program Executive Office, Medical Systems, which strengthens the DHA by enabling the use of resource data to make better-informed decisions, implementing enhanced cybersecurity protections, and improving fiscal auditability.

Flanders described how his team is “responsible for ensuring the products and services under its purview enable combat support in competition, crisis, and conflict, and ensure the full continuum of health delivery from the foxhole to the home front.”

DHA’s information technology enterprise leverages the strength and sophistication of a unified network—the Medical Community of Interest—and legacy systems to support DHA’s mission as a combat support agency by ensuring a reliable IT infrastructure worldwide for its military hospitals and clinics, as well as the 9.5 million beneficiaries DHA supports. Flanders said his various divisions do this by:

• Protecting and securing the medical network and data by meeting Department of Defense cybersecurity requirements

• Facilitating continuous support to DHA’s clinical care enterprise

• Aligning resources to modernize the DHA IT infrastructure with the work of DOD chief information officers and other DOD agencies

• Driving financial auditability compliance

The real rises were much smaller—and the evidence doesn’t tell us they were caused by the Covid vaccines anyway.
We saw almost a 300% increase in cancer over the five-year average… Neurological issues, which would affect our pilots, over a 1,000% increase.” In fact, these numbers are based on a data error.
The number of testicular cancer encounters rose 3%, for example, not 369%.
This has nothing to do with Covid vaccines anyway It’s worth saying that even after the error was corrected, this data can’t be used to calculate the change in the rates of these conditions—let alone any changes caused by the Covid vaccines.","A widely shared post on Facebook falsely claims that Covid vaccines caused a tripling of miscarriage and cancer rates, and a tenfold rise in neurological disorders.

In fact, these numbers were based on the result of a data error in military records from the US Department of Defense (DoD), which was corrected more than three years ago.

The real rises were much smaller—and the evidence doesn’t tell us they were caused by the Covid vaccines anyway.

The post features a video of a man called Thomas Renz citing data that he says comes from the Defense Medical Database (DMED) during a panel discussion [4:55:05] about the Covid-19 response, hosted by the US Senator Ron Johnson in January 2022. This is how we know that the “jabs” referred to in the Facebook post relate to Covid.

Mr Renz says in the video: “We have substantial data showing that we saw, for example, miscarriages increased by 300% over the five-year average, almost. We saw almost a 300% increase in cancer over the five-year average… Neurological issues, which would affect our pilots, over a 1,000% increase.”

In fact, these numbers are based on a data error. A spokesperson for the Defense Health Agency’s Armed Forces Surveillance Division told Politifact, another fact checker, in 2022 that they came from a comparison with faulty data from the past, which made the rate of these and other conditions in 2016-2020 seem much too low. So when the more complete 2021 data was compared against that faulty baseline, it created the false impression of dramatic spikes in various conditions.

Senator Johnson himself later acknowledged receipt of a document from the DoD, which explained that the error happened during a server migration. As the document said: “The data for years 2016 through 2020 contained only approximately 10% of the true number of outpatient medical encounters for that period, which created an inaccurate appearance that diagnoses for medical conditions increased when compared to previous years.”

While the document doesn’t give a figure for the correct rise in miscarriage or cancer encounter rates in general, it says the correct figure for neurological issues was 3%, and cites a number of increases for specific cancers that are well below 300%. The number of testicular cancer encounters rose 3%, for example, not 369%. For breast cancer, it was 1.1% instead of 487%.

This has nothing to do with Covid vaccines anyway

It’s worth saying that even after the error was corrected, this data can’t be used to calculate the change in the rates of these conditions—let alone any changes caused by the Covid vaccines.

The data measures the number of “outpatient medical encounters” for active service members, meaning the number of times they had contact with medical staff for given conditions. There might be more than one encounter per condition, and the encounters recorded in a given year might relate to a condition that developed much earlier.

As the DoD notes in its document, “Counts of health care encounters are not representative of new cases of these diagnoses; they are a measure of the workload for the health system regarding provision of care associated with these diagnoses. Counts of health care encounters cannot be used as a proxy for the prevalence of disease.”

In short: “The ability to make inferences from the data using the available preset queries is very limited… To address specific questions on Service members’ health, a more thorough analysis is required.”

Besides, even if this data did show a change in prevalence, it still wouldn’t tell us that the change was caused by the Covid vaccines. Some people may have had these conditions before being vaccinated, while others may have developed them for other reasons.

We, and other fact checkers, have written about this error when it has been the source of misinformation several times before.

Serious side effects from Covid vaccination do occur on rare occasions. But the MHRA, which monitors their safety in the UK, says: “The benefits of the vaccines in preventing COVID-19 and serious complications associated with COVID-19 far outweigh any currently known side effects in the majority of patients.”

Office for National Statistics data shows that, in England, 63 deaths involving Covid vaccines were registered up to July 2023. But analysis from the UK Health Security Agency found that the vaccines prevented 127,500 deaths in England up to 24 September 2021. Overall, it is estimated that they save millions of lives worldwide.

Bad information can be dangerous if people use it to make decisions about their health.

(KOAA) — The community stepped up to help raise more than $50,000 in just three days through a Zeffy fundraiser to help SFC David Hong, but Hong isn't keeping a dime of that money.

""Life is more important than anything,"" SFC Hong said to News5 in a video interview.

Hong joined the Army when he was 36, now 52. He worked as a religious affairs specialist and he's been battling stage 4 colon cancer in recent years as he goes through the medical retirement process. The cancer was discovered during a routine colonoscopy. He came to Fort Carson's Solider Recovery Unit in September of 2023 to receive support after the diagnosis.

""I mean, it was pretty devastating, especially for my wife and my family,"" Hong stated.

For about two to three years, Hong underwent 23 treatments of chemo and several surgeries. But the cancer kept coming back. His wife did some research and learned of a procedure called histotripsy, a non-invasive procedure that uses ultrasound waves to essentially liquify tumor cells. The procedure was pricey, and TRICARE didn't cover it.

Hong's wife was able to connect with an organization called HunterSeven, a veteran-founded group that conducts research on military exposures among post-9/11 veterans and educates the veteran and healthcare population on critical health information relating to their exposures. HunterSeven helped set up the fundraiser that raised tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of days for Hong.

""We were just blown away by the love,"" Hong said. ""Ultimately, this is bigger than me. It was about fighting cancer and being able to do this treatment that would be less invasive.""

Hong said HunterSeven also helped him go through the waiver request process with TRICARE, ultimately, Hong says he was approved for the procedure through TRICARE via the waiver. Hong says the money raised is now going to help others. Hong had the treatment earlier this month. He will undergo regular screenings in the coming months, but he's hopeful that this procedure was a success.

""Even though we might live in a society that might be imperfect, I think we need to focus on the things that are positive,"" Hong said. ""We're so thankful. And cancer is a horrible disease and illness, and I will never want anybody to go through it.""

The Defense Health Agency sent News5 the following statement about histotripsy:

""DHA is aware of recent discussion regarding histotripsy. We are prohibited by HIPAA and the Privacy Act to release Protected Health Information or Personally Identifiable Information on any TRICARE beneficiary.

That said, as a standard practice, the Department monitors and continuously assesses and reassesses available evidence on emerging treatments and technologies to determine the safety and effectiveness of new treatments. The Department assessed histotripsy, an emerging treatment, as a part of its standard practice in 2024, and found the treatment did not meet the Federal statutory requirements for coverage under TRICARE.The available evidence on histotripsy is scarce and of low quality, yielded no clinically relevant outcomes, and included no professional guidelines or opinions on the use of histotripsy for liver tumors.

TRICARE beneficiaries retain access to TRICARE covered, established, evidence-based treatment options through military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and private sector TRICARE-authorized providers. Referrals for care from MTF or TRICARE-authorized providers do not mean automatic coverage of non-covered services.

Gen. John Andrus, then the Joint Staff Surgeon; and Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, listen as Navy Capt.","Air Force Brig. Gen. (Dr.) John R. Andrus recently served as the Joint Staff Surgeon, culminating a 37-year career in military health. Like his predecessors, he brought deep experience and insight to advise top leadership within the Department of Defense on all matters concerning military health care -- family medicine, operational readiness, and warfighter health — at home, in theater, and in space.

He held the role as the top military medical advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since June 2023, and this summer turned the reigns over to the current JSS, Army Brig. Gen. Clinton K. Murray.

Andrus sat down with MHS News to talk about the role of the JSS and how his career prepared him for that work. He officially retires from military service on Sept. 1, 2025.

He said it’s vital for his role to understand the Military Health System from “the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared the MHS is to support the joint force.”

As JSS, he’s not only the senior medical advisor to the Chairman and the Joint Staff, but also the combatant commanders. The work stems across the entire DOD, to include collaborating with the service surgeons general and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

After graduating from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1993, Andrus has supported a wide spectrum of military medical missions around the world.

After completing his residency in family medicine at David Grant USAF Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, his first assignment was overseas in the Azores. Andrus called it “a blessing of going to USU, because they wanted people with military experience before they sent them overseas, particularly to a remote area.” His team served 3,000 service members and their families, with just four family practice physicians. “It was rural medicine at its best,” Andrus said. It was there that he knew he wanted to be a military flight surgeon.

He attended flight surgeon school at Brooks City-Base in Texas and got his first flight surgeon assignment at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. He spent three years there supporting the medical group and flying air medical evacuation missions with the 76th Airlift Squadron, a C-9 squadron. He also flew with the 37th Airlift Squadron, a C-130 squadron.

During this phase of his decorated career, he served as a NASA flight surgeon, leading DOD support to NASA. When the space shuttle would launch, his team would send an airplane to the designated transatlantic landing site and stand watch, prepared to provide medical support — setting up a small hospital in the back of a C-130 and waiting with pararescuemen. If needed, the pararescuemen would conduct the rescue mission, and Andrus’ team would cover medical evacuation, working together as a team. “We had to be trained and prepared to take the astronauts out of their spacesuits, evaluate them, and then get them back to CONUS,” he said of the role.

A soundtrack to these missions was the radio traffic between Houston and the astronauts, listening for their greeting on their way up to space reassured his medical evacuation team was there. When the space crew reported that they made their orbit — which took only a few seconds — his team would tear down, get back on the airplane, and fly back to Ramstein.

While serving as chief of aerospace medicine at the 62nd Medical Group at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, he got orders to his first joint assignment at United States Africa Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, as the deputy surgeon general. This led to his next joint assignment at United States Transportation Command as the command surgeon.

His keen ability to collaborate across services and invaluable experience in warfighter health care paved the way for him to serve as the JSS.

During his final interview in uniform, Andrus shared his insights of how the JSS helps ensure high-quality health care is delivered to warfighters who are being asked to complete missions circling the Earth, around the globe, or at home — in his words, “wherever they may be.”

Question: What is the role of the Joint Staff Surgeon?

Andrus: What's contained in that role is a need to understand the MHS. If I'm offering recommendations to the chairman as he formulates his advice to the Secretary of Defense, I need to have a good understanding. I need to be able to scan the MHS and understand from the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared is the MHS to support the joint force. The chairman is being asked to support a mission by the President for a reason: If an action needs to be taken somewhere around the globe to create an effect, we have military forces across multiple services designed to do certain things that in a combined effort are intended to accomplish certain objectives. For that to occur, there needs to be medical support to those forces as they're preparing to deploy or provide support to other missions. There also needs to be support forward to make sure they remain healthy and that they're able to perform at their peak performance level. If things go wrong, patients can be recovered, treated, and then put back in the system right.

The MHS has one mission: To care for our service members.

Question: Talk about how you work with the chairman, the Joint Staff, the combatant commanders, the service surgeons general, and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Andrus: My role is to collaborate with them. I sit at the table. What's important to note is that at that table, all voices should be equal. And the joint voice at that table is particularly unique because it brings a perspective looking across the entire health system. The service surgeons general bring incredibly valuable, organized voices to the table that are service-specific, so we understand the service equities. I have my own voice from an operational side and then from a joint side, we try to align those activities to what's required. I represent the mission.

My role with Health Affairs is to make sure that we're collaborative.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara

(acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs) has a very significant role as the resource manager for the defense health program funding. The chairman's voice also comes across to the secretary (of defense) in terms of resourcing as well. So, you've got two voices that are coming from two different points in the organization. It’s a unit. I have an independent voice representing the chairman and representing, most importantly, the joint force. That collaboration is critical to make sure that we are aligned.

Question: Describe the Joint Staff Surgeon’s role in navigating changes in the MHS.

Andrus: The MHS itself has gone from a service-centric entity to a much more joint-oriented entity. You have to know what you're doing and how all the parts work together. You have to know how to engage in the system. People don't realize how large the MHS is. About a year ago, I talked to the chairman about some of the core challenges in the MHS -- what were some gaps, perhaps in our preparedness to do the things we might be asked to do, right from an operational perspective.

When I arrived, the Defense Health Agency was only a year into having administrative authority, direction control over the MTFs (military hospitals and clinics), which was hard to overestimate how much tectonic change that meant for the system. We asked, “What are the impacts of that change?”

There was a change in the structure and now in new realignment of responsibilities and authorities. We analyzed if the resources aligned to those new responsibilities, asking, “What's at the root of some of the challenges that we're trying to overcome?”

Question: What are the next steps to address challenges with the MHS?

Andrus: We have been working the capability portfolio management review now for coming up on a year, and we've had some incredible insights that have come out of it —not just from trying to solve the surface problem but understanding what's underlying and really getting after the systemic issues that need to be resolved to move forward.

We're going to ask for permission to go back and reassess our joint capability areas as a foundational element to build and define capability portfolios across the entire military medical mission. We have to remember the mission is taking care of service members. The mission is measured by the combat effectiveness of the units we support. We have to broaden that definition to include our partners that can provide the services with medics that are trained, equipped, and ready to go.

Question: What do you envision for the future of the MHS?

Andrus: We’re at a point in time right now where we have an opportunity to really advance the MHS. If somebody asks me, “What's the one thing that we should do?” I say, “To improve the MHS.” We can be too focused on differences. We need to be more focused on where there’s alignment and build on that alignment. Each leader needs to recommit themselves to leaning in and working together. That means that we need to understand the mission from the same sight picture, and we need to lean into that mission and allow individual opinions, desires, and preferences to go by the wayside as we figure out the most effective way to get the mission done: To support the warfighter.

Andrus leaves behind a legacy of dedication to warfighter and family health, a core focus on resiliency of the joint force, and an encouragement to continue what the MHS strives for: working together to improve the health of all those entrusted to its care.

“As we collaborate and coordinate to understand each other, we have to come together on areas where it makes sense,” he said. “Then, we are more effective to help the MHS move forward.”

“For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.
Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.
That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.
“We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,” he said.","New legislation in the Senate would ensure that every National Guardsman has medical coverage.

Introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the Healthcare for Our Troops Act (S. 2575) would offer premium-free, zero-cost-share medical coverage to every member of the Guard and Reserve through TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program.

About 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists currently have no medical coverage. Hundreds of thousands more pay for their own coverage or rely on employer-provided health insurance.

Baldwin spoke at the 147th General Conference & Exhibition on Saturday in Milwaukee, where she received the NGAUS Harry S. Truman Award, the association’s highest honor.

“We’ve fallen short in a pretty crucial area and that is basic health care,” she told attendees. “I believe that’s morally wrong. It’s bad for preparedness and readiness. And yes, we need to change it.”

“Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president. “For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.

“Our Guardsmen need this, and our nation needs them,” he added. “I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

Current law provides coverage to part-time Guardsmen and Reservists only when they are federally mobilized on orders for more than 30 days. Most of the Guard’s domestic missions are of a shorter duration. Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.

In addition, Guardsmen must also be medically ready to respond to the state or nation with little to no notice. This can be challenging for the almost one in five who have no private coverage and lack access to routine, preventive health care, McGinn added.

Zero-cost TRICARE is a top NGAUS legislative priority.

Both the House and Senate have considered legislation to expand medical coverage to part-time service members in recent years. Major legislation such as this often requires several years to win congressional approval.

S. 2575 would enroll Guardsmen and Reservists into TRICARE Reserve Select at no cost.

TRS is currently a partially subsidized program for drilling Guardsmen and Reservists. They cover a monthly premium and co-pays for services. The legislation would eliminate all those costs.

That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.

“We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,” he said. “We need to view Guard Soldiers and Airmen in the same light.”",https://www.ngaus.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-08/082825tricare1000.jpg?itok=D_MM1TYJ,N,0.0,2025-08-28 11:56:53.164321

BOSTON, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amwell® (NYSE: AMWL), a leading technology-enabled care platform provider, announced that as part of a Leidos-led partnership, it has been awarded an extension of its next-generation Digital First contract to power the digital transformation of the Military Health System (MHS), which serves approximately 9.6 million beneficiaries.

Under the contract extension, Amwell will continue to provide its comprehensive technology-enabled care platform to power virtual care delivered by MHS providers. The platform for scheduled virtual visits has been successfully deployed, on time and on budget, across the global DOD enterprise and to the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command (MEPCOM) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).

The platform replaced the MHS Video Connect solution, enabling providers with tech-enabled care. It is fully integrated within the MHS electronic health record and continues to enable the provision of dynamic health solutions for our military care teams, service members, and their families.

Through integrated platform solutions, Amwell is contributing to important efficiency initiatives, reducing burdens on care teams, improving the health and wellness of beneficiaries, reducing healthcare costs and optimizing the effective utilization of DHA's clinical resources across their global enterprise.

“Our platform is in use across the global DOD enterprise, enabling high quality, efficient care for this important population. We are grateful for the service of our nation’s military, and we are proud to be supporting their wellbeing,” said Ido Schoenberg, M.D., chairman and CEO of Amwell. “We are honored to extend this relationship and support the Department of Defense initiatives to realize the benefits of tech-enabled care across the MHS.”

The DHA’s Digital Front Door initiative has brought new capabilities and enablement to MHS GENESIS, an advanced electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare system solution that supports military and Veteran healthcare initiatives. The Amwell platform has deep integration assets and a simple yet powerful user experience that enables efficient and high-quality technology-enabled care delivery. The platform is already embedded into existing clinical workflows that care teams rely on, including those within the MHS GENESIS EHR. Amwell is providing technology to enable the DHA to leverage the benefits of hybrid care, improve access to healthcare, and ultimately improve outcomes for the MHS community.

Some highlights of platform success to date include:

Nearly tripling of virtual visits since replacing the DHA’s MHS Video Connect capability

Recent expansion beyond DHA sites to include MHS beneficiaries in the USCG and U.S. MEPCOM

Successful virtual visits from deployed units in a combat zone connected to a military hospital in the United States

The DHA supports U.S. national security and ensures our nation’s military teams are ready to deploy. Digital First supports the entire MHS community of users, which includes approximately 9.6 million active-duty service members, family members, retirees, and health professionals across the continuum of care.

Defense Health Agency officials, in a response to Military Times, contended the change corrects unauthorized coverage that Tricare has been providing to beneficiaries who weren’t eligible for the weight-loss medications.
Tricare will continue to cover those weight-loss medications for younger beneficiaries — those enrolled in Tricare Prime or Tricare Select or premium-based plans.
The premium-based plans include Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve and Continued Health Care Benefit Program.
The issue of coverage of weight-loss medications has a complicated regulatory and legislative history with conflicting guidance, she said.","Just a few days before coverage for weight-loss drugs is set to end for Tricare for Life beneficiaries, advocates are calling on the Defense Health Agency and lawmakers to halt those plans.

A new policy takes effect Aug. 31 for Wegovy, Zepbound, Saxenda, Qsymia, Phentermine and Contrave, affecting coverage of those drugs for weight-loss purposes. Tricare for Life is the Tricare plan for Medicare-eligible military retirees and their Medicare-eligible family members.

Defense Health Agency officials, in a response to Military Times, contended the change corrects unauthorized coverage that Tricare has been providing to beneficiaries who weren’t eligible for the weight-loss medications.

Tricare will continue to cover those weight-loss medications for younger beneficiaries — those enrolled in Tricare Prime or Tricare Select or premium-based plans. Those beneficiaries still must have prior authorizations for the weight-loss drugs. They must also meet Tricare’s clinical criteria and have a prescription from a Tricare network provider.

The premium-based plans include Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve and Continued Health Care Benefit Program.

Current plans to end this coverage “risk the progress made by patients taking these medications and cast doubt on the future of the [Tricare for Life] benefit,” wrote Karen Ruedisueli, director of health affairs in government relations for the Military Officers Association of America, on the nonprofit organization’s website.

She said MOAA has sent an email to DHA officials expressing their concerns, and she noted they’re getting considerable feedback from their members.

The issue of coverage of weight-loss medications has a complicated regulatory and legislative history with conflicting guidance, she said. Thus, “halting this policy change would provide time to assess the legislative and regulatory history governing Tricare policy on weight loss medications and determine next steps to avert negative impacts to beneficiaries,” she wrote in the article calling for a halt in the plans.

In an Aug. 5 press release that included information about the change, Tricare officials said the Defense Health Agency is “implementing regulatory controls” on weight-loss medication coverage.

“Tricare has been providing coverage for weight loss medications to beneficiaries who were not eligible under federal statute. This implementation corrects that unauthorized coverage,” DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said in an email response to Military Times’ questions about the reasons for ending the coverage.

She noted that different laws govern Tricare Prime and Tricare Select.

“These laws allow DOD to offer certain health care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options that are not available to [Tricare for Life] beneficiaries,” Campbell said. “Some Tricare for Life beneficiaries were found to have received coverage for these medications inconsistent with existing statutory and regulatory authority.”

In the Aug. 5 announcement of the change, Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Cordts said “people are taking GLP-1 drugs — like Wegovy and Zepbound — for weight loss now more than ever. It’s important to understand how — and why — Tricare covers these drugs, based on your condition and status.”

In an email to Military Times, one Tricare for Life beneficiary prescribed Wegovy said she feels as if Tricare officials “are saying we are subpar members, not as worthy as the Prime or Select members.”

“Wegovy has been a miracle for my medical conditions of obesity, metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, sleep apnea,” she added. “All of that improved with this medication. Now they just cut it off.”

The letter she received from Tricare stated she could continue filling her current prescription — and pay 100% of the drug cost. That amounts to $1,300 per month.

“That will take most of our retirement money,” she said.

GLP-1 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diabetes will continue to be covered for all patients who have a diabetes diagnosis, when medically necessary and when prior authorization requirements are met, according to Tricare officials.

Tricare covers Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Victoza to treat type 2 diabetes, with prior authorization. Ozempic, Mounjaro and Victoza require medical necessity forms for a formulary copayment and coverage at a military pharmacy, officials stated.

Since the change in coverage was announced, MOAA has received a considerable amount of feedback from its members, all of whom went through extensive prior authorization processes to document co-morbid conditions, lifestyle changes and trials of alternative medications before they met the clinical criteria for approval for the weight-loss medications, Ruedisueli wrote, adding that Tricare doesn’t cover these drugs for cosmetic purposes.

The members are worried their progress will be reversed if they can no longer use these drugs.

“A physician from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center also reached out to MOAA with concerns about the new policy and its impact on Walter Reed’s military retiree patients,” Ruedisueli wrote.

And members who aren’t directly affected have another concern: that the change represents a terrible precedent and could lead to further targeted cuts to Tricare for Life. MOAA shares that concern, Ruedisueli wrote.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/military_times_968/049f7ab0fb1dc03131e1f3d5e2447776,N,0.0,2025-08-28 11:57:16.651987

Achieving Unified Data Accessibility and Data-Driven Insights Across the Defense Health Agency

HT0011-25-RFI-0230

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is not at this time seeking quotes or proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.

Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.

The results of this Market Research may inform acquisition strategy and will contribute to determining the method of procurement.

2.0 Background:

2.1. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is committed to providing the highest quality healthcare and support to our beneficiaries. DHA operates in a complex environment, generating and managing a vast amount of data across multiple clinical and administrative systems, and supporting business operations, combat support missions, and healthcare delivery. While we have accumulated a significant volume of data, DHA seeks a modern, integrated approach to transform this data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making, continuous improvement, and enhanced organizational visibility.

Historically, this need was addressed through data warehousing concepts. However, we recognize that contemporary data landscapes demand more sophisticated and interconnected solutions that leverage the latest technologies and methodologies. DHA envisions a mature and interconnected data ecosystem that proactively identifies trends, patterns, and opportunities across its three core operational areas:

Business Operations: Optimizing headquarters-level healthcare delivery business operations that support the Networks and Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in delivering quality healthcare. This includes improving administrative functions, resource allocation, performance management, workflows, cost containment, and enhancing the user experience for both DHA personnel and the Networks/MTFs they support. The focus is on enabling efficient and effective healthcare delivery at the point of care.

Combat Support Mission: Ensuring readiness and providing effective healthcare support to the warfighter. This includes analyzing readiness metrics, identifying areas for improvement in medical training and deployment support, and optimizing resource allocation for contingency operations.

Healthcare Delivery: Improving patient outcomes, enhancing the quality of care, and ensuring patient safety. This includes analyzing patient data to identify trends in disease prevalence, optimizing treatment protocols, and reducing healthcare costs.

DHA seeks to enable a mature and interconnected data ecosystem that empowers data-driven decision-making and enables continuous improvement across its three core operational domains: Business Operations, Healthcare Delivery, and Combat Support. This is not a static solution, but rather a dynamic and evolving ecosystem that adapts to the changing needs of the DHA mission: providing high-quality healthcare to those who serve and their families. The desire is to have an environment where data becomes a strategic asset, driving tangible improvements in patient care, healthcare delivery efficiency, and combat readiness. We are particularly interested in solutions that deliver the following desired outcomes:

Provide a readily accessible, unified view of data, regardless of the source or format (structured or unstructured) to enable comprehensive analysis and informed decision-making.

Generate actionable insights to enable proactive identification of trends, patterns, and opportunities.

Allow stakeholders at all levels to easily access, understand, and interact with relevant data to inform their decisions.

Guarantee the security, privacy, and regulatory compliance of data. The solution must protect sensitive information, maintain data integrity, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Facilitate the continuous monitoring and evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs), enabling proactive identification of areas for improvement and tracking of progress towards organizational goals.

Readily adapt to evolving data volumes, sources, and business requirements. The solution must be scalable, flexible, and capable of accommodating future growth and change.

2.2 This RFI is intended to gather information on industry best practices, innovative technologies, and potential solutions that can enable DHA to achieve its vision for a data-driven organization. Responses to this RFI will inform DHA's desired approach to data analytics.

The DHA is seeking information from interested Vendors with the capability to achieve unified data accessibility and data-driven insights. To illustrate our specific needs and desired outcomes, DHA has included high-level use cases that describe how we envision leveraging data across our organization. Please be advised that these use cases are illustrative and subject to further refinement based on the information received from this RFI.

To further explore potential solutions and engage in a collaborative exchange of ideas, DHA will be hosting a Reverse Industry Day on Tuesday, October 14, 2025 in the National Capital Region. This Reverse Industry Day will be on an invitation only basis and will provide an opportunity for selected vendors to demonstrate their capabilities, present potential solutions, and engage in dialogue with DHA leadership and technical experts. Further details regarding the Reverse Industry Day, including registration and submission guidelines for the RFI, are included in the subsequent sections of this document.

5.0 Unified Data Accessibility and Data-Driven Insights Use Cases.

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) desires to improve its ability to translate data into actionable insights and improved outcomes. The below proposed use cases are designed to describe the types of capabilities we desire. This is not an exhaustive list but is intended to kickstart the conversation.

USE CASE 1: Real-Time Blood Product Tracking and Management for Combat Casualty Care

Problem:

Blood and blood products are critical for saving lives on the battlefield. However, maintaining real-time visibility into blood product inventory levels, location, and expiration dates across the entire DHA (including deployed and fixed facilities) is a major challenge.

Lack of real-time data can lead to:

Shortages of blood products in critical locations.

Waste of expired blood products.

Delays in delivering blood to patients who need it most.

Inefficient movement of blood products between facilities.

Data Sources:

MHS GENESIS: Patient blood type information, transfusion history, point-of-care testing results at fixed facilities and Role 3 treatment facilities.

JOMIS (Joint Operational Medicine Information System): Real-time inventory of blood products at deployed medical facilities (Role 1, 2, and forward surgical teams (FST)), blood product usage data, location of medical units.

TRANSCOM (Transportation Command) Systems: Tracking of blood shipments from CONUS-based blood banks to deployed locations, real-time location of blood in transit, temperature monitoring data during transport.

DoD Blood Donor Program: Blood donor information, collection schedules, blood type distribution, and donor availability.

Blood Bank Information Systems (BBIS) (at fixed facilities): Comprehensive blood inventory management.

Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Providers (if used): Tracking of blood shipments.

Desired Blood Product Management Capabilities:

Unified view of blood product information across the DHA, encompassing inventory levels, location, expiration dates, and usage patterns (both historical and forecasted).

Automatically identify and alert key personnel to critical events affecting blood product availability, quality, or delivery.

Predict future blood product demand based on various factors, including historical usage, operational requirements, and potential emergency scenarios.

Optimize the allocation and distribution of blood products across the MHS to ensure timely availability where and when needed most.

Identify potential blood donors and target recruitment efforts to address specific blood type shortages and ensure adequate supply.

Real-time information on blood product availability during triage and casualty evacuation to inform treatment decisions.

Automatically initiate blood product resupply based on real-time consumption and projected demand, ensuring continuous availability.

Improve the planning and execution of blood drives and mobile blood collection units to maximize donation yields and meet regional and overall needs.

Minimize the likelihood of blood product shortages at critical locations across the DHA, safeguarding patient care.

Minimize the waste of expired blood products, improving resource utilization and reducing costs.

Expedite the delivery of blood products to casualties on the battlefield, improving survival outcomes.

Efficient and effective allocation of blood product resources across the MHS, maximizing the impact of limited supplies.

Increase overall blood donation rates to meet the ongoing needs of the warfighter and the DHA beneficiary population.

USE CASE 2: Unified Bed Management and Patient Flow Optimization Across the Continuum of Combat Care

Problem:

Efficient bed management is crucial for optimizing patient flow, maximizing resource utilization, and ensuring casualties receive the right level of care at the right time.

However, bed management in the DHA is complicated by the distributed nature of the system, the dynamic demands of deployed operations, and the need to seamlessly transition patients between different levels of care (Roles 1-3, FSTs, CONUS-based hospitals).

Lack of real-time visibility into bed availability, patient acuity, and resource constraints can lead to:

Overcrowding and delays in care.

Suboptimal allocation of resources (staff, equipment, beds).

Increased risk of adverse events (e.g., hospital-acquired infections).

Delays in medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) due to lack of available beds at higher echelons of care.

Poor coordination of patient transfers between facilities.

Data Sources:

MHS GENESIS: Bed availability, patient census, patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, acuity scores, discharge plans, staffing levels at fixed facilities and Role 3 facilities.

JOMIS (Joint Operational Medicine Information System): Bed availability, patient census, patient demographics, injuries, illnesses, treatment provided at deployed medical facilities (Roles 1, 2, and FST), location of medical units.

TRANSCOM Systems: MEDEVAC request data, transportation schedules, patient movement tracking.

Medical Command (MEDCOM) Command and Control Systems: Overall operational picture, anticipated mass casualty events, surge capacity planning.

VA Systems (Cerner Millennium): Bed availability and patient data at VA hospitals for potential patient transfers.

Commercial Hospital Systems (if participating in the TRICARE network): Bed availability and patient data for potential patient transfers.

Device Data: Telemetry, wearable sensor data (with consent) providing real-time patient status.

Desired Unified Bed Management System Capabilities:

Unified and readily accessible view of bed availability, patient acuity levels, and resource constraints across the entire enterprise.

Allocate beds to patients based on a combination of factors, including patient acuity, medical needs, and available resources.

Forecast future bed demand based on historical utilization data, anticipated operational requirements, and potential surge events.

Optimize patient transfer processes between medical facilities, ensuring timely movement to the most appropriate level of care.

Facilitate effective surge capacity planning, enabling proactive identification of potential bottlenecks and development of strategies to expand bed capacity during emergency situations.

Real-time visibility into bed availability across all levels of the healthcare system.

Provide early indicators to alert relevant personnel to potential bed shortages or overcrowding situations.

Efficiently manage the number of beds by facility and across DHA.

USE CASE 3: Improving Patient Care and Outcomes through Optimized Resource Management

Problem: Balancing the need to provide timely and high-quality patient care with challenges in resource management. This manifests as:

Long wait times for appointments, hindering access to timely care.

Inefficient utilization of medical staff and facilities, leading to potential waste and reduced capacity.

Staffing shortages and inefficient scheduling, increasing workload and burnout for healthcare providers.

High no-show rates, further disrupting schedules and reducing the availability of appointments.

Increased cost related to redirecting care to local community providers.

Data Sources:

Appointment scheduling systems

Patient demographic data

Historical appointment data (including no-show rates)

Clinic/MTF resource availability (staff, equipment, rooms)

Staffing schedules and employee skill/certification data

Patient volume and service demand data

Geographic location data (for telehealth planning)

FMTS (Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking System) and UMD (Unit Manning Document): authoritative staffing plan for each MTF. Impacts the ability to dynamically adjust allocation of staffing resources based on real-time demand and operational need.

DCPDS (Defense Civilian Personnel Data System): alpha roster , the authoritative Human Resource system to track Civilian personnel and their assignment to positions on the UMD by department/clinic and functional area. To be considered as part of solutions for dynamically adjusting personnel resources.

Interface Control Data from the Military Personnel Systems, particularly real-time access to the DHP aligned military positions that each Service assigns to the DHA (HQs, Networks, and MTFs). The civilian personnel are only one portion of a large-scale problem in identifying available resources, ensuring accuracy with schedules, and providing automated solutions.

We're going to ask for permission to go back and reassess our joint capability areas as a foundational element to build and define capability portfolios across the entire military medical mission.","Air Force Brig. Gen. (Dr.) John R. Andrus recently served as the Joint Staff Surgeon, culminating a 37-year career in military health. Like his predecessors, he brought deep experience and insight to advise top leadership within the Department of Defense on all matters concerning military health care -- family medicine, operational readiness, and warfighter health — at home, in theater, and in space.

He held the role as the top military medical advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since June 2023, and this summer turned the reigns over to the current JSS, Army Brig. Gen. Clinton K. Murray.

Andrus sat down with MHS News to talk about the role of the JSS and how his career prepared him for that work. He officially retires from military service on Sept. 1, 2025.

He said it’s vital for his role to understand the Military Health System from “the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared the MHS is to support the joint force.”

As JSS, he’s not only the senior medical advisor to the Chairman and the Joint Staff, but also the combatant commanders. The work stems across the entire DOD, to include collaborating with the service surgeons general and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

After graduating from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1993, Andrus has supported a wide spectrum of military medical missions around the world.

After completing his residency in family medicine at David Grant USAF Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, his first assignment was overseas in the Azores. Andrus called it “a blessing of going to USU, because they wanted people with military experience before they sent them overseas, particularly to a remote area.” His team served 3,000 service members and their families, with just four family practice physicians. “It was rural medicine at its best,” Andrus said. It was there that he knew he wanted to be a military flight surgeon.

He attended flight surgeon school at Brooks City-Base in Texas and got his first flight surgeon assignment at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. He spent three years there supporting the medical group and flying air medical evacuation missions with the 76th Airlift Squadron, a C-9 squadron. He also flew with the 37th Airlift Squadron, a C-130 squadron.

During this phase of his decorated career, he served as a NASA flight surgeon, leading DOD support to NASA. When the space shuttle would launch, his team would send an airplane to the designated transatlantic landing site and stand watch, prepared to provide medical support — setting up a small hospital in the back of a C-130 and waiting with pararescuemen. If needed, the pararescuemen would conduct the rescue mission, and Andrus’ team would cover medical evacuation, working together as a team. “We had to be trained and prepared to take the astronauts out of their spacesuits, evaluate them, and then get them back to CONUS,” he said of the role.

A soundtrack to these missions was the radio traffic between Houston and the astronauts, listening for their greeting on their way up to space reassured his medical evacuation team was there. When the space crew reported that they made their orbit — which took only a few seconds — his team would tear down, get back on the airplane, and fly back to Ramstein.

While serving as chief of aerospace medicine at the 62nd Medical Group at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, he got orders to his first joint assignment at United States Africa Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, as the deputy surgeon general. This led to his next joint assignment at United States Transportation Command as the command surgeon.

His keen ability to collaborate across services and invaluable experience in warfighter health care paved the way for him to serve as the JSS.

During his final interview in uniform, Andrus shared his insights of how the JSS helps ensure high-quality health care is delivered to warfighters who are being asked to complete missions circling the Earth, around the globe, or at home — in his words, “wherever they may be.”

Question: What is the role of the Joint Staff Surgeon?

Andrus: What's contained in that role is a need to understand the MHS. If I'm offering recommendations to the chairman as he formulates his advice to the Secretary of Defense, I need to have a good understanding. I need to be able to scan the MHS and understand from the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared is the MHS to support the joint force. The chairman is being asked to support a mission by the President for a reason: If an action needs to be taken somewhere around the globe to create an effect, we have military forces across multiple services designed to do certain things that in a combined effort are intended to accomplish certain objectives. For that to occur, there needs to be medical support to those forces as they're preparing to deploy or provide support to other missions. There also needs to be support forward to make sure they remain healthy and that they're able to perform at their peak performance level. If things go wrong, patients can be recovered, treated, and then put back in the system right.

The MHS has one mission: To care for our service members.

Question: Talk about how you work with the chairman, the Joint Staff, the combatant commanders, the service surgeons general, and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Andrus: My role is to collaborate with them. I sit at the table. What's important to note is that at that table, all voices should be equal. And the joint voice at that table is particularly unique because it brings a perspective looking across the entire health system. The service surgeons general bring incredibly valuable, organized voices to the table that are service-specific, so we understand the service equities. I have my own voice from an operational side and then from a joint side, we try to align those activities to what's required. I represent the mission.

My role with Health Affairs is to make sure that we're collaborative. Dr. Stephen Ferrara (acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs) has a very significant role as the resource manager for the defense health program funding. The chairman's voice also comes across to the secretary (of defense) in terms of resourcing as well. So, you've got two voices that are coming from two different points in the organization. It’s a unit. I have an independent voice representing the chairman and representing, most importantly, the joint force. That collaboration is critical to make sure that we are aligned.

Question: Describe the Joint Staff Surgeon’s role in navigating changes in the MHS.

Andrus: The MHS itself has gone from a service-centric entity to a much more joint-oriented entity. You have to know what you're doing and how all the parts work together. You have to know how to engage in the system. People don't realize how large the MHS is. About a year ago, I talked to the chairman about some of the core challenges in the MHS -- what were some gaps, perhaps in our preparedness to do the things we might be asked to do, right from an operational perspective.

When I arrived, the Defense Health Agency was only a year into having administrative authority, direction control over the MTFs (military hospitals and clinics), which was hard to overestimate how much tectonic change that meant for the system. We asked, “What are the impacts of that change?”

There was a change in the structure and now in new realignment of responsibilities and authorities. We analyzed if the resources aligned to those new responsibilities, asking, “What's at the root of some of the challenges that we're trying to overcome?”

Question: What are the next steps to address challenges with the MHS?

Andrus: We have been working the capability portfolio management review now for coming up on a year, and we've had some incredible insights that have come out of it —not just from trying to solve the surface problem but understanding what's underlying and really getting after the systemic issues that need to be resolved to move forward.

We're going to ask for permission to go back and reassess our joint capability areas as a foundational element to build and define capability portfolios across the entire military medical mission. We have to remember the mission is taking care of service members. The mission is measured by the combat effectiveness of the units we support. We have to broaden that definition to include our partners that can provide the services with medics that are trained, equipped, and ready to go.

Question: What do you envision for the future of the MHS?

Andrus: We’re at a point in time right now where we have an opportunity to really advance the MHS. If somebody asks me, “What's the one thing that we should do?” I say, “To improve the MHS.” We can be too focused on differences. We need to be more focused on where there’s alignment and build on that alignment. Each leader needs to recommit themselves to leaning in and working together. That means that we need to understand the mission from the same sight picture, and we need to lean into that mission and allow individual opinions, desires, and preferences to go by the wayside as we figure out the most effective way to get the mission done: To support the warfighter.

Andrus leaves behind a legacy of dedication to warfighter and family health, a core focus on resiliency of the joint force, and an encouragement to continue what the MHS strives for: working together to improve the health of all those entrusted to its care.

“As we collaborate and coordinate to understand each other, we have to come together on areas where it makes sense,” he said. “Then, we are more effective to help the MHS move forward.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9133953/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-27 17:56:09.027145

Dr. Jarrod Miller was named Outpatient Pharmacist of the Year; Christina Puppolo earned Supervisory Technician of the Year; and Vielka Asbury received Support Technician of the Year.

“Team Munson took home three of the four categories this year,” said Col. Jolanda L.J. Walker, Munson’s director. “We’re very fortunate to have such an outstanding pharmacy team who go above and beyond to support our patients every day.”

The DHN West awards highlight civilian pharmacy employees whose performance strengthens the Defense Health Agency’s mission and improves patient care.

Dr. Jason Brozek, Munson’s chief of pharmacy services, praised Miller’s leadership and teamwork.

“Dr. Miller is the kind of teammate everyone wants,” Brozek said. “He brings a positive attitude, embraces challenges, and inspires those around him. He’s the first person both pharmacists and technicians go to with questions, and he always takes the time to give thoughtful, well-researched answers while still excelling in his own work.”

Brozek also highlighted Puppolo’s leadership as a pharmacy technician supervisor.

“Christina sets a high standard for her team, but she does it with encouragement and teaching,” he said. “She notices what her team needs, can step into any role, and makes both patients and staff feel valued. That commitment to safety and efficiency makes a real difference.”

For Miller and Puppolo, this year’s selection marks back-to-back wins.

As a support technician, Asbury keeps Munson’s pharmacy stocked with medications—no small task when it comes to balancing patient needs and budget constraints.

“Vielka is excellent at managing high-cost medications without overstocking,” said Brozek. “That kind of stewardship ensures patients have what they need while keeping the pharmacy reliable and cost-effective.”

The three winners will now advance to the Defense Health Agency-wide competition later this year, competing against counterparts from across the country and overseas. National winners will be announced during the Joint Federal Pharmacy Seminar.

Munson is one of nine military treatment facilities within DHN West and provides care for more than 13,000 Military Health System beneficiaries. The health center supports the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center’s mission, and its services range from primary care to pharmacy, laboratory, mental health, and 24/7 medical support for the Military Corrections Complex, home to the DoD’s only maximum-security prison.

Bumgarner of the Western District of Kentucky.

Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE pay for medical services provided by nurse practitioners, but the amount of payment is different than if the service is provided by a physician. The United States alleged that Dr. Charasika and LPCMH violated the False Claims Act by billing government programs as if he provided medical services when, in fact, the services were provided by nurse practitioners. For Medicare, if particular conditions are satisfied, services provided by a nurse practitioner may be billed as if they were performed by a physician, but the United States alleged that Dr. Charasika and LPCMH did not satisfy those conditions.

Louisville Patient Centered Medical Home, P.S.C., et al., Case No. 3:20-cv-3390-CRS (WDKY). Under the qui tam provisions, the relators received more than $35,000 from the settlement proceeds.

“This office is committed to investigating allegations of healthcare fraud and protecting federal healthcare programs,” said U.S. Attorney Bumgarner. “I appreciate the whistleblowers coming forward in this case and encourage others who see fraud to do the same.”

“The alleged conduct affects the integrity of the government healthcare programs that our most vulnerable citizens rely on,” said Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman. “I’m grateful for the opportunity for our team to work with our federal partners to investigate allegations of healthcare fraud.”

The Kentucky Office of Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit helped investigate this matter and received more than $68,000 of the settlement amount due to the alleged false claims submitted to Medicaid. The United States Department for Health and Human Services Office of Counsel to the Inspector General and Office of Investigations also helped obtain this settlement.

The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, can be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services at 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).

Assistant United States Attorney Timothy Thompson handled this matter.

The claims resolved by settlement agreement are allegations only. There has been no determination of liability.

David Norvell Walker Grant, the first surgeon general of the U.S. Army Air Corps and U.S. Army Air Forces, is known as the grandfather of the present-day Air Force Medical Service. David Grant USAF Medical Center (60th Medical Group) at Travis Air Force Base, California, is named in his honor.

The scale of Grant’s influence on modern military medicine cannot be overstated: His vision, innovations, and unshakeable determination changed the course of battlefield care and aeromedical capabilities we use today.

The Sanitary Train

According to an official U.S. Air Force biography, Grant received his medical degree from the University of Virginia in 1915. During World War I, Grant served as a sanitary inspector and then later as a surgeon at Camp Gordon, Georgia. In 1919, he took command of the “sanitary train” on departure for Mayen, Germany. Constituted in 1917, the train was not locomotive—but rather a system of hospitals, surgeons, and ambulances. Field operations reports by U.S. Army General John J. Pershing in “American Expeditionary Activities in Germany, Italy, North Russia, and Siberia” note that Grant’s train had motorized and animal-drawn battalions—the rugged land, slow travel, and volume of casualties made for a painstaking endeavor to transport wounded from the front lines to hospitals.

Pioneering Airman

According to the article, “The Making of the Air Surgeon: The Early Life and Career of David N.W. Grant” by historian Robert E. Skinner, provided by U.S. Air Force Medical Service Senior Historian Dr. Joseph Frechette, Grant was transferred to the epicenter of U.S. Army Air Corps training. In 1931, the Grant family arrived at the brand-new, barely-yet operational Randolph Field, now Randolph Air Force Base. Grant pulled double duty as a post surgeon and flight surgeon.

Skinner wrote that leading up to World War II, Grant spent the subsequent period developing the theoretical understanding of aviation in combat and convincing the war department that developing a system of air evacuation of casualties would be a worthwhile investment of time and resources.

Grant was the first medical officer to be ordered to Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama in 1936, where he wrote his thesis that became the groundwork of all aero evacuation.

“With mechanized armies, contact with the enemy will occur over large areas, necessitating a more mobile ambulance service than we have at present,” he wrote.

Grant is directly responsible for the development and use of aeromedical evacuation in World War II, and theorized use of helicopter-like aircraft in combat long before their wide use in Korea and Vietnam.

Dr. Thomas Julian of the U.S Air Force History and Museums Program detailed in “A History of Aeromedical Evacuation in the U.S. Air Force” how Grant studied unique problems such as airsickness, motion sickness and radiation exposure. This research was vital in aeromedical care, as there was limited common understanding of capabilities due to the newness of air warfare in the 1930s.

According to an excerpt from “Doctors at War,” provided by Frechette, Grant himself explored the shifting popular ideas about aero readiness, as he wrote: “The problem is to take a man whose body is adapted to function in a ground environment and whose mind is conditioned to seek peace and security and fit him for a life of a flying, fighting animal.”

Under Grant’s direction, military aviation psychologists developed the most comprehensive mass testing procedure in history for the selection and classification of aircrew based on aptitude, personality, and interest, according to an official U.S. Air Force biography. Grant noted in “Doctors at War”, “Since we cannot build the flier to specifications or wait for evolution to turn him into a superman, our only alternative is to select and train the individuals best fitted for this duty, and then provide them with devices and methods for protection.”

Also carried out under his direction was aeromedical research in human requirements for high-altitude flight and the development of oxygen equipment, electrically heated clothing, and anti-G suits.

According to Dr. Thomas Julian, by the outset of World War II, Grant had spent nearly a decade collecting evidence and winning supporters for aeromedical evacuation. In 1939, after the German attack on Poland created a period of U.S. military armament and increases in spending, the first air ambulance unit was approved.

By 1953, aerospace medicine was designated as a board-certified specialty.

Travis AFB Excels at Care in the Air

Modern-day Travis AFB operates an aeromedical staging facility that can unload and upload patients to and from large aircraft. This capability makes David Grant USAF Medical Center a crucial hub in global warfighter readiness, as well as for emergency management in the event of regional and national disasters. The center has been recognized with renowned accomplishments over the years.

In February 2023, the center’s Intensive Care Unit team received a DAISY Award—an internationally recognized award that celebrates nurses who have made profound differences in the lives of others. The center was later awarded USAF Surgeon General Hospital of the Year at the 2024 Air Force Medical Service Annual Awards, demonstrating expertise, leadership, and commitment of the mission supporting the U.S. Air Force and combatant commanders.

In August 2025, TAFB demonstrated the highest standard in aeromedical capabilities during Exercise Ultimate Caduceus 2025, a U.S. Transportation Command-led field training simulation in global patient movement. The drill simulated the reception, treatment, and onward transport of injured personnel from overseas to designated military hospitals and clinics—demonstrating how Grant’s work fuels excellence in aeromedical evacuation and health care today.

“Grant built an incomparable Army Air Forces Medical Service,” Skinner wrote. “(He) directed great strides in aeromedical research and created the Air Evacuation Service that safely transported over a million casualties from the various theatres of the war.”

Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., is taking another crack at a bill designed to expand no-cost health care coverage for guardsmen and reservists.

Kim brought the legislation back a year later and both lawmakers introduced bills to provide no-premium dental coverage for Selected Reserve members in 2023.
Last year, Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., tried to address the issue with a bill that would make guardsmen and reservists eligible for Veterans Benefits Administration health coverage.
NGAUS, the Wisconsin National Guard Association, the Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association and Reserve Organization of America have offered support for the new bill.","Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., is taking another crack at a bill designed to expand no-cost health care coverage for guardsmen and reservists.

Last month, Baldwin re-introduced the Healthcare for Our Troops Act (S. 2575), which would eliminate some health care costs for guardsmen and reservists currently enrolled in TRICARE Reserve Select plans, the Defense Department’s premium-based health plan for Selected Reserve components.

The legislation would ensure that TRICARE Reserve Select enrollees would not be charged in-network premiums, while their immediate family members’ premiums would apply instead of any required enrollment fees.

“Our service members in the National Guard and Reserve serve and sacrifice for their nation every day – and just like the brave men and women in every other service branch, they deserve and have earned high quality, affordable health care,” said Baldwin in an Aug. 21 statement. “My bill doesn’t just deliver earned benefits to our troops, it’s also an investment in military readiness to ensure service members get the care they need to stay healthy.”

Providing guardsmen and reservists with zero-cost TRICARE coverage has remained an elusive goal for Congress for several years. The National Guard Association of the United States, which lobbies on behalf of guardsmen, estimates 130,000 of its personnel don’t have health insurance.

Baldwin first introduced the legislation in 2022 as a companion bill to then-Rep Andy Kim’s, D-N.J., own proposal. Kim brought the legislation back a year later and both lawmakers introduced bills to provide no-premium dental coverage for Selected Reserve members in 2023.

Last year, Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., tried to address the issue with a bill that would make guardsmen and reservists eligible for Veterans Benefits Administration health coverage. None of those proposals made it out of committee.

NGAUS, the Wisconsin National Guard Association, the Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association and Reserve Organization of America have offered support for the new bill.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2025/08/25/082525_Getty_GovExec_BaldwinNatGuardPBWatch/open-graph.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-27 12:56:33.498202

TFL coverage of GLP-1 drugs that are FDA-approved to treat weight loss (Wegovy, Zepbound, and Saxenda) is slated to end Aug. 31.

TRICARE does not cover weight-loss drugs for cosmetic purposes.

These MOAA members attribute notable improvements to high blood pressure, sleep apnea, elevated A1C (a pre-diabetes indicator), and other medical conditions to their GLP-1 medications. They are worried progress will be reversed if they can no longer access such drugs. A physician from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center also reached out to MOAA with concerns about the new policy and its impact on Walter Reed’s military retiree patients.

Families who rely on Tricare, the military’s health insurance program, want to know whether their coverage extends to situations connected to DUI-related care.

The central question becomes: does Tricare cover family members with a DUI in Idaho?

The short answer is that Tricare does not directly cover legal expenses, court fines, or penalties related to a DUI.

However, Tricare may cover medically necessary treatment for substance use disorders or mental health conditions, even if those needs are connected to a DUI incident. Coverage eligibility depends on the individual’s plan, the type of care recommended, and whether services are received from approved providers in Idaho.

Our latest resource on substance use and mental health topics from MilitarySpot.com provides details in order to assist you with understanding what’s covered in regards to coverage and treatment.

Understanding Tricare Coverage in Idaho

Tricare provides healthcare benefits for active duty service members, retirees, and their families. In Idaho, family members may use Tricare for a range of services, including primary care, mental health treatment, and substance use disorder programs.

The state has a mix of military families located near bases and those living in rural areas who rely on civilian providers within the Tricare network, including an accredited treatment center in Boise.

For families dealing with the aftermath of a DUI, this often means exploring whether treatment services like detox, inpatient rehab, outpatient therapy, or counseling are covered. While a DUI itself is considered a legal matter, Tricare recognizes that substance use and behavioral health needs require evidence-based care, and those services are generally included in the benefits package.

What Tricare Will Not Cover After a DUI

It is important to be clear about what Tricare will not cover. Legal proceedings, attorney fees, court-mandated fines, and costs tied to license reinstatement are not part of the benefit structure.

These are considered legal consequences, not healthcare services. Families sometimes mistakenly believe insurance may offset these expenses, but coverage is limited strictly to medical and behavioral health needs.

This distinction is key because it helps families focus on where Tricare can actually provide meaningful support: the treatment of conditions that may have contributed to the DUI incident.

Substance Use Treatment and Tricare Benefits

When asking whether Tricare covers family members with a DUI in Idaho, substance use treatment is one of the most relevant areas.

Tricare includes benefits for both inpatient and outpatient programs addressing alcohol and drug use. If a family member receives a DUI and is clinically assessed as needing care for alcohol misuse or dependency, Tricare may cover:

Medical detoxification in a hospital or approved treatment center

Residential or inpatient rehabilitation programs

Partial hospitalization programs (PHP) and intensive outpatient programs (IOP)

Outpatient counseling sessions with licensed providers

Coverage often depends on whether the care is considered medically necessary and provided by an authorized facility. In Idaho, this can mean treatment centers in Boise, Coeur d’Alene, Idaho Falls, or other communities that accept Tricare beneficiaries.

Mental Health Coverage for Families

A DUI often reveals or intensifies underlying mental health struggles. Stress, trauma, depression, or anxiety can all play a role in substance misuse. Tricare’s mental health benefits extend to family members, including counseling, psychiatric care, and medication management.

Idaho families can access these services through civilian providers who are part of the Tricare network or, in some cases, through telehealth platforms if local options are limited. This is especially important in rural parts of the state, where in-person specialty care may be harder to find.

Court-Ordered Treatment and Tricare

One common question is whether Tricare will pay for treatment that has been ordered by the court as part of a DUI sentence. The answer is nuanced. Tricare does not cover services simply because a judge requires them. However, if the treatment aligns with what Tricare already considers a covered benefit—such as substance use counseling or rehab—then coverage may apply.

For example, if an Idaho court orders a family member to complete an outpatient alcohol program at an Idaho alcohol and substance abuse facility, and that program is provided by a Tricare-approved facility, the services may be covered. Families should verify this with both the provider and Tricare before starting care to avoid unexpected costs.

Navigating Tricare Plans in Idaho

Coverage also depends on which Tricare plan a family member uses. Options like Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, or Tricare Reserve Select have slightly different requirements when it comes to providers and referrals. In many cases:

Tricare Prime requires referrals from a primary care manager before specialty treatment begins.

Tricare Select allows more flexibility in choosing providers but may have higher out-of-pocket costs.

Tricare Reserve Select offers similar benefits for Guard and Reserve families but with additional enrollment requirements.

Understanding the specific plan in use is essential when determining whether treatment connected to a DUI will be covered in Idaho.

The Role of Medical Necessity for Tricare Coverage

Another important factor is medical necessity. Tricare reviews coverage requests based on whether a provider documents that care is clinically required.

For DUI-related cases, this often means a provider must show that the family member has a diagnosable substance use disorder or mental health condition that requires treatment. Without this documentation, Tricare may deny coverage.

Working With Tricare-Approved Providers in Idaho

Not all treatment facilities automatically accept Tricare. Families need to confirm that the program or clinician is within the network. Idaho has several behavioral health and addiction treatment providers who work with military families, but options may be more limited in smaller towns. If no local provider is available, Tricare may approve care outside of the immediate network to ensure access.

Checking the Tricare provider directory or calling regional offices can help families identify the right programs without delays.

Support Beyond Insurance

While Tricare provides a foundation of support, families in Idaho may also need additional resources. Community-based organizations, state DUI education programs, and peer support groups can all play a role in recovery and accountability. Combining Tricare-covered treatment with these resources often gives family members a stronger chance of long-term stability.

Military-specific supports, including chaplain services and base family programs, may also help families cope with the emotional impact of a DUI.

A Source of Help for Idaho Families With Tricare

So, does Tricare cover family members with a DUI in Idaho? The answer is yes, but only in specific ways.

Coverage applies to the medical and behavioral health needs that may arise from or contribute to a DUI, not to the legal consequences themselves.

Families can expect Tricare to help with treatment for alcohol use, substance dependency, and mental health issues, provided services are deemed medically necessary and delivered by approved providers.

Choosing Mental Healthcare in New Mexico with Tricare So, does Tricare cover inpatient mental healthcare in New Mexico?","AUGUST 26, 2025 – If you or a loved one is stationed in New Mexico and having issues that require mental health support, you will likely face a crucial question when seeking behavioral health treatment: Does Tricare cover inpatient mental healthcare?

The answer is yes. Tricare does provide coverage for inpatient mental health treatment, including psychiatric hospitalization and residential care.

However, the details depend on the type of Tricare plan you have, your clinical needs, and the treatment facility.

In this latest resource on behavioral and mental health topics, MilitarySpot.com reviews these details and helps you and your family members navigate care more confidently and make informed decisions about accessing treatment in New Mexico.

Tricare and Mental Health Benefits

Tricare is the healthcare program serving uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. Mental health benefits are an essential part of its coverage, reflecting the recognition that mental well-being is as critical as physical health.

Tricare’s behavioral health benefits include outpatient therapy, intensive outpatient programs, partial hospitalization, and inpatient care for psychiatric conditions and substance use disorders. For individuals in New Mexico, this means access to a continuum of care at both civilian and military-approved facilities.

Inpatient Mental Healthcare Defined

Inpatient mental healthcare refers to treatment that requires a patient to stay at a hospital or residential facility. It is typically recommended for individuals experiencing acute psychiatric symptoms, severe depression, suicidal ideation, or conditions that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting.

In New Mexico, inpatient care can occur in general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, or specialized residential treatment centers that meet Tricare’s credentialing and accreditation requirements.

How Coverage Works in New Mexico

Tricare covers inpatient mental healthcare in New Mexico when it is deemed medically necessary. Medical necessity is determined by a licensed provider and involves evaluating whether symptoms are severe enough to require a structured, 24-hour treatment environment.

Prior authorization is often required before admission, especially for non-emergency cases. For emergencies, individuals can seek immediate care and notify Tricare within a specified timeframe.

Costs depend on the beneficiary’s status and plan type. Active-duty service members generally have no out-of-pocket costs, while retirees and dependents may be responsible for copayments or cost-shares.

Facilities in New Mexico that accept Tricare must be certified and licensed to deliver inpatient mental healthcare. This ensures that patients receive evidence-based treatment in safe, regulated environments.

Facilities in New Mexico That Accept Tricare

New Mexico has several hospitals and treatment centers where Tricare beneficiaries can access inpatient psychiatric care. Larger metropolitan areas, such as Albuquerque, offer more options. This includes an accredited Albuquerque facility that takes Tricare. Rural areas tend to have fewer facilities. Some patients in rural areas may also access care in neighboring states if specialized services are unavailable locally.

Court-Ordered Mental Health Treatment

In some cases, individuals may be required by a court to undergo a mental health evaluation or treatment. Tricare generally covers medically necessary inpatient mental healthcare, but court-ordered treatment adds a layer of complexity.

If the recommended care aligns with clinical necessity and takes place at a Tricare-approved facility, coverage may apply. Families navigating court-ordered treatment in New Mexico should coordinate closely with both the court system and Tricare representatives to clarify coverage specifics.

Tricare Plan Types and Their Impact

The type of Tricare plan influences how inpatient care is accessed and what costs may apply. Tricare Prime members in New Mexico often need a referral from their primary care manager before admission to an inpatient facility, unless it is an emergency.

Tricare Select members have more flexibility in choosing providers but may face higher out-of-pocket expenses if care is received at an out-of-network facility.

Tricare For Life beneficiaries, often military retirees over 65, also have coverage for inpatient psychiatric care, coordinated with Medicare benefits.

When Inpatient Care is Recommended

Inpatient care that you will find at an evidence-based treatment center in Albuquerque is usually recommended for individuals experiencing psychiatric crises such as suicidal thoughts, severe mood episodes, psychosis, or the inability to perform daily activities safely.

Providers may also recommend inpatient care following a failed trial of outpatient therapy or when intensive stabilization is required.

For families in New Mexico, knowing that Tricare covers this level of care provides reassurance that support is available when it is most urgently needed.

The Role of Residential Treatment Centers

Residential treatment centers (RTCs) differ slightly from inpatient hospitals in that they offer structured therapeutic programs in live-in settings rather than hospital-based care. Tricare covers RTCs for adolescents and, in some cases, for adults when treatment is clinically appropriate and the facility meets Tricare’s certification standards.

This can be particularly valuable for families in New Mexico seeking longer-term, holistic treatment options such as equine therapy and adventure therapy, both of which can be helpful for teens struggling with mental health conditions or co-occurring substance use disorders.

Navigating Authorization and Referrals

For inpatient care in New Mexico, families should expect to engage in the authorization process. This involves the provider submitting documentation to Tricare demonstrating the medical necessity of inpatient treatment.

In urgent or emergency cases, this process is expedited, and notification to Tricare can be made after admission. Staying proactive with documentation and communication helps reduce delays and ensures smoother access to benefits.

Transitioning from Inpatient to Outpatient Care

Coverage does not end when inpatient treatment is complete. Tricare supports a continuum of care, which often includes step-down services such as partial hospitalization or outpatient therapy. This ongoing support helps reduce the risk of relapse or readmission.

In New Mexico, many providers coordinate with both the patient and Tricare to create aftercare plans that sustain recovery and stability.

Common Questions About Coverage

Families and individuals often ask whether Tricare covers inpatient stays of any length. The answer depends on medical necessity and provider recommendations. While Tricare does not impose arbitrary limits on inpatient days, ongoing reviews ensure that treatment remains clinically justified.

Another common question is whether beneficiaries must use military hospitals. In New Mexico, where military hospitals may not always be close by, civilian facilities that accept Tricare are typically available and covered when in-network.

Why Coverage Matters in New Mexico

New Mexico’s geography presents unique challenges in accessing mental healthcare. Many rural areas have limited behavioral health resources, making Tricare coverage critical for military families who may otherwise face barriers to care.

By covering inpatient treatment at approved facilities, Tricare reduces financial strain and ensures that beneficiaries receive timely, evidence-based support, even when facing severe mental health crises.

Choosing Mental Healthcare in New Mexico with Tricare

So, does Tricare cover inpatient mental healthcare in New Mexico? Yes, it does.

Coverage applies when treatment is medically necessary, occurs at a Tricare-approved facility, and follows required authorization processes. For military members, veterans, and their families, this means access to lifesaving psychiatric care during times of crisis.

Understanding plan requirements, being proactive with referrals and authorizations, and selecting in-network facilities help maximize benefits.

We hope that our resource from Military Spot has shown how, for service members and families navigating mental health challenges in New Mexico, Tricare provides an essential safety net that ensures care is within reach when it matters most.
