CPAP sent a breach notification letter to numerous impacted individuals, informing them of the 2024 cyberattack. According to the letter, cybercrooks breached CPAP’s network between December 13th and December 21st of last year.

Information the company submitted to the Maine Attorney General’s Office revealed that over 90,000 individuals were impacted by the attack.

CPAP provides sleep therapy gear. The company’s website strongly emphasizes its focus on US military personnel. CPAP also accepts Tricare, a US Defense Department health program for service members.

“We commenced a prompt and thorough investigation into the incident and worked very closely with external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of situations to help determine whether any personal or sensitive data had been compromised as a result of this incident,” reads the data breach notice.

Meanwhile, the data breach notice that CPAP posted on its website indicates that attackers may have accessed customer names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), and other “identifiable protected health and personal information.”

Individuals whose data may have been stolen could experience increased levels of cybersecurity threats. For example, attackers could leverage the stolen data for identity theft. Cybercrooks could also use the details to craft phishing attacks by attempting to impersonate healthcare providers, hoping to lure additional sensitive details.

Depending on what health information was exposed, attackers could also attempt medical identity theft. Medical details are a prized possession in the cyber underworld, as they enable attackers to file fraudulent insurance claims and prescriptions for regulated drugs.

While CPAP pointed out that it has no indication that exposed details were misused, the company said it will offer affected individuals complimentary credit and identity monitoring services.

Healthcare institutions are among the most targeted. According to research from the Business Digital Index, the majority of the largest US hospitals have recently dealt with cyberattacks and data breaches. For example, in 2024, healthcare-related data breaches led to the theft of over 267 million records.",https://media.cybernews.com/images/featured-big/2025/06/patient-data-breached.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-23 11:56:07.701301

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for Tricare beneficiaries to participate in research via remote meetings between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5. The lab will hold several studies, asking participants to test out specific scenarios. Each session will last about one hour.

Officials want feedback on the content, navigation, visuals and layout of the website.

It comes at an opportune time, as Tricare’s open season begins Nov. 10, when people will be exploring their options for Tricare coverage. However, it’s not clear whether any recommendations for changes in the website would be implemented before open season.

Researchers are looking for participants from a variety of Tricare health plans, ages, locations and experiences.

Those eligible must be current Tricare beneficiaries who are at least 18 years old and have a computer or mobile device in order to access Tricare.mil and Microsoft Teams. A Microsoft Teams account is not required. Participants must have a stable internet connection, the ability to share their screen and a working microphone. They must be available on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time.

Participants don’t need a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate.

Researchers and the Tricare communications team will use the data to help update and redesign different parts of the Tricare.mil site. The Defense Health Agency won’t publicly share names or information of study participants, but participants will be asked to share their input with other participants on the call.

Those who want to participate should send an email by Wednesday, Sept. 3, to dha.jblm.solution-deliv.list.dha-usability-lab@health.mil.

Include “Tricare Usability Study” in the email subject line, and in the email, provide your name, age, location, Tricare health plan, how long you’ve been a Tricare beneficiary and your beneficiary category, such as active duty service member, retiree, or active duty family member, for example.

Participants will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis. Researchers may not be able to include everyone due to capacity constraints.

In each case, we raised serious concerns about the ongoing importance of peeling back the regulatory excesses of the unelected bureaucracy in recent years:

1. DHA’s Misuse of Credit Checks for Health Access (DOD-2025-HA-0006)

CRF challenged the Defense Health Agency’s policy of using “soft” credit checks and credit card data as identity verification for access to MHS GENESIS. Not only does this compromise privacy and invite confusion, but it also creates unnecessary barriers to care for young dependents and low-income families. There is no clear legal authority for this requirement, and it appears to have been implemented without public input or congressional notification.

2. DOI’s Smart Move on Offshore Wind Mandates (BOEM-2025-0036)

CRF supported the Department of the Interior’s direct final rule rescinding the outdated requirement to publish a five-year offshore renewable energy leasing schedule. The rule had no statutory foundation and falsely signaled inevitable lease sales, distorting markets. Rescission reinforces regulatory clarity and aligns with energy security priorities.

3. EPA’s New Source Review Paperwork Buildup (EPA-HQ-OAR-2022-0037)

CRF urged EPA to remain vigilant against growing paperwork burdens from information collection requests tied to solid waste incinerators and combustion turbines. While EPA has improved burden estimates, CRF stressed the cumulative impact of overlapping mandates that harm energy sector investment and competitiveness.

4. DOE’s Misguided School Mental Health Expansion (ED-2025-OESE-0153)

CRF opposed the Department of Education’s proposed expansion of school-based mental health programs, citing lack of evidence, parental rights concerns, and ideological risk. Instead of vague, top-down “wellness” mandates, CRF called for targeted, clinically grounded interventions for students with diagnosed mental illness.

Regulatory Reform in the News

Dr. Susan Dudley on Congress’s Role After Loper

At a Senate hearing on July 30, former OIRA Administrator (and the founder of the George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center) Dr. Susan Dudley testified on the implications of the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, which overturned the Chevron doctrine. Dr. Dudley emphasized:

Courts, not agencies, will now interpret statutes—but agency expertise on technical matters will still matter.

Congress must draft laws with greater clarity, distinguishing between legal, factual, and policy questions.

Transparency is key: agencies must disclose their assumptions and acknowledge policy tradeoffs.

Overreliance on “science” as a cover for value judgments must stop; legislative accountability must return.

She endorsed creating a congressional regulatory office to complement OIRA, helping lawmakers write clearer statutes and evaluate regulations over time.

Upcoming Next Week

CPAC to Weigh In on Election Technology Security

The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking public comments on proposed updates to the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG 2.0), specifically regarding performance benchmarks for high-speed scanning equipment used in elections: EAC-2025-0001-0006.

CRF will submit comments emphasizing the need for:

Election Integrity – Every vote must be verifiable, auditable, and secure.

Transparency – Voters and election observers must be able to understand and scrutinize election technologies.

Accountability – Election vendors and local officials must be held to the highest standards of performance.

Security – No system should be certified without rigorous, third-party-tested protections against manipulation.

We intend to use this opportunity to reaffirm that secure elections are the cornerstone of a free republic.

The Defense Health Agency oversees the nation’s largest health-care system that serves a patient population of more than 9.5 million service members, retirees and their families.
More than 39,000 employees at the Defense Health Agency are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, according to AFGE.
But an employee’s application for the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment, or VSIP, option does not guarantee an offer, the agency said.
Certain jobs were exempted from the buyout program at the discretion of the network directors, the Defense Health Agency said.","WASHINGTON — The Defense Health Agency that oversees more than 700 military hospitals and clinics worldwide disclosed Thursday that it made a buyout offer to an unidentified number of civilian personnel to be considered for lump-sum payouts to leave their jobs under a restructuring of the federal agency.

The Defense Health Agency said it plans to grant the voluntary buyouts to certain employees on a job-by-job basis as part of a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment program. Employees were required to submit applications this week to express their interest in accepting an incentive payment to resign, the agency said. But the agency declined to discuss the specific terms outlined in the buyouts. But the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment Authority, also known as the buyout authority, allows federal agencies downsizing or restructuring to offer employees one-time payments of up to $25,000 as an incentive to resign from their jobs, according to the Office of Personnel Management.

The Defense Health Agency oversees the nation’s largest health-care system that serves a patient population of more than 9.5 million service members, retirees and their families.

“Any effort to slash the Department of Defense’s health care civilian workforce without a careful analysis is a threat to our national security and service members’ ability to access health care and other critical services,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

More than 39,000 employees at the Defense Health Agency are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, according to AFGE.

An AFGE spokesman said Thursday that the buyout offer is among several initiatives by the Defense Health Agency to draw down its workforce, including deferred resignations and early retirements. The agency’s offer of voluntary resignations follows an announcement by the Defense Department earlier this year that it would reduce its workforce by 5% to 8% as part of a larger downsizing of federal agencies ordered by President Donald Trump.

Network directors who manage the Defense Health Agency with a workforce of 130,000 were authorized to identify certain jobs to eliminate and ask employees to submit applications by Aug. 18, according to the agency. But an employee’s application for the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment, or VSIP, option does not guarantee an offer, the agency said.

“This is a voluntary program, and network directors retain authority to approve or disapprove of requests,” according to the agency. The agency also declined to identify the number of employees who turned in applications by a Monday deadline or the types of jobs targeted for downsizing. The agency’s decisions on the applications are expected by the end of August, according to AFGE.

Certain jobs were exempted from the buyout program at the discretion of the network directors, the Defense Health Agency said.

“Defense Health Agency network directors were authorized to offer the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment or VSIP incentive to shape their workforce and enable our military hospitals and clinics to deliver their capabilities and services within the scope of their facilities’ plans,” the agency said in a written statement.

An “agency may offer VSIP to employees who are in surplus positions or have skills that are no longer needed in the workforce who volunteer to separate by resignation,” according to the Office of Personnel Management. “Agencies such as the Department of Defense that have been granted agency-specific VSIP authority are not required to seek OPM approval for their use of this option.”

The Defense Health Agency is a combat support agency with a mission to provide and manage a medically ready force, according to the Defense Department.

The Defense Department is the nation’s largest employer, with more than 2.1 million service members and more than 800,000 civilian workers.",,N,0.0,2025-08-22 20:56:08.077383

The exclusion is for all access to GLP-1s for TFL beneficiaries that don’t meet the Medicare criteria.
Under the Tricare plan, Prime and Select patients continue to get their GLP-1s, TFL don't.
Nothing in § 1074g limits that availability to Prime/Select enrollees or excludes TRICARE For Life (TFL).
However, if your goal is to include GLP-1s on the uniform formulary for obesity alone, I would support that.","Nicely done. But, you’re only partly right, just not the right part:

True: Title 10 §1079 says “[t]reatment of obesity may not be provided if obesity is the sole or major condition treated.” That’s in 10 U.S.C. §1079(a)(10)—the basic CHAMPUS benefit baseline.

True: The 2017 carve‑out for Prime/Select (services) in DoD’s 2017 interim final rule, (IFR) implementing FY2017 NDAA authority, expressly allows treatment of obesity (even when it’s the sole/major condition) for TRICARE Prime and Select. That language is at 32 C.F.R. §199.17(f)(3).

BUT: What Tricare is proposing now is more than just excluding GLP-1s to TFL for treatment of obesity. The exclusion is for all access to GLP-1s for TFL beneficiaries that don’t meet the Medicare criteria. There are many TFL (and Prime and Select) beneficiaries on GLP-1s for conditions that include obesity coupled with comorbidities – satisfying Tricare criteria, but not Medicare criteria. Under the Tricare plan, Prime and Select patients continue to get their GLP-1s, TFL don't.

Where you overreach:

The Tricare pharmacy program sits on different legal rails than §1079.

TRICARE’s pharmacy benefit is authorized by 10 U.S.C. §1074g and implemented at 32 C.F.R. § 199.21. The regulation explicitly notes this law is independent of other Title 10 sections that govern TRICARE medical benefits, i.e., the § 1079 rules don’t automatically control the basic pharmacy program. The “uniform formulary” is for eligible covered beneficiaries—not just Prime/Select.

Section 1074g requires DoD to maintain a uniform formulary and to assure availability of formulary agents to eligible covered beneficiaries through MTF, retail, or mail order channels. Nothing in § 1074g limits that availability to Prime/Select enrollees or excludes TRICARE For Life (TFL). DoD has long articulated the “uniform” nature of the formulary; for example, the Federal Register has stated that drugs on an MTF formulary must be available to all beneficiaries (MTF context, but it reflects the uniformity principle).

The 2017 rule’s obesity language you reference is about services, not a ceiling on drugs. The carve‑out in §199.17(f)(3) sits in the managed‑care (services) section. It does not speak to, or limit, the separate pharmacy authority in § 199.21. The rule itself specifies that TFL is “unaffected by this section” (See 199.17(a)(6)(ii)(C) and is generally governed by §§199.3, 199.4, and 199.8—again underscoring that §199.17’s managed‑care enhancements don’t define the pharmacy program.

The IFR contains long standing exclusions for weight reduction services and medications—e.g., appetite suppressants and other medications used primarily for weight control. These exclusions apply across the Basic Program, not to any single plan. This is the text DoD/DHA could cite to deny coverage when a GLP 1 is prescribed solely for weight loss, but it does not support limiting GLP 1s to Prime/Select enrollees when otherwise covered under Tricare criteria. No plan specific limitation appears.

Yes, the 2017 IFR spoke in terms of “Prime/Select “when operationalizing coverage for anti obesity treatments, but, again, that limitation doesn’t come from the language of § 706 or § 729. Sections 706 and § 729 are plan neutral and speak in terms of “covered beneficiaries.” The 2017 IFR reference to Prime/Select appears to be an administrative choice, not a limitation imposed by §§ 706/729.

The proposed TFL restrictions are an effort to make a policy choice – only its not a choice they have the authority to make. They need a statute to give them that authority, and until they amend the law, they do not have it.

Bottom Line: Tricare is out of luck unless Congress acts – and I seriously doubt that will happen. This is a major FU and I plan on making sure its noted.

However, if your goal is to include GLP-1s on the uniform formulary for obesity alone, I would support that. This is a class of drugs that are very effective in addressing a host of serious illnesses. I would support making these much more widely available - Medicare/Medicaid, Affordable Care Act plans? Let's negotiate better prices and MAHA. ;-)",,N,0.0,2025-08-22 19:56:12.298727

As governments grapple with fiscal constraints and strategic priorities, the interplay between budget allocations, regulatory frameworks, and labor policies has profound implications for both operational readiness and long-term investment viability. This article examines how recent political actions—ranging from budget cuts to workforce modernization efforts—impact healthcare access and labor stability in the defense sector, offering insights for investors navigating this complex landscape.

The Dual Challenge: Labor Shortages and Healthcare Access

The defense sector faces a dual crisis: a shrinking pool of skilled labor and a declining reliance on military healthcare services. According to the 2025 Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook, over 67% of manufacturers cite talent attraction and retention as their top business challenge. This is compounded by an aging workforce, with 25% of defense sector employees nearing retirement. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense (DoD) reports that TRICARE beneficiaries using military healthcare facilities have halved over the past two decades. To address these issues, the DoD has launched a “right sizing” initiative to realign medical staffing and improve healthcare access for service members and their families.

Political decisions, however, complicate these efforts. The Trump administration's unilateral spending freezes and executive orders to delay discretionary funding—such as veterans' healthcare programs—threaten to undermine workforce stability. For instance, the FY 2025 defense budget allocates $128 billion for veterans' healthcare, yet this discretionary spending is vulnerable to impoundment or cuts if Congress fails to pass timely appropriations. Such instability risks eroding trust in the sector's ability to provide consistent care, potentially deterring talent from joining or remaining in defense roles.

Budgetary Constraints and Workforce Modernization

The FY 2025 defense budget of $849.8 billion includes targeted investments in labor stability, such as a 4.5% pay raise for service members and $2.0 billion for family housing. These measures aim to bolster retention and morale, but their effectiveness hinges on broader fiscal policies. For example, proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid—though not directly tied to defense—could ripple into the sector by reducing the availability of civilian healthcare services for military families. Similarly, the administration's push to restore impoundment powers under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act introduces uncertainty, as it may allow unilateral reductions in discretionary spending, including veterans' healthcare.

Investors must also consider how political decisions influence workforce modernization. The defense sector is increasingly adopting AI, extended reality (XR), and automation to address labor shortages. For instance, apprenticeship programs have tripled in advanced manufacturing roles since 2021, while XR is being tested to accelerate employee training. However, these innovations require sustained funding and regulatory support. If political priorities shift toward austerity, investments in digital transformation may stall, hampering the sector's ability to adapt.

Healthcare Access: A Strategic Lever for Workforce Stability

The DoD's “right sizing” initiative underscores the link between healthcare access and labor stability. By realigning medical staffing to meet current demand, the department aims to re-engage TRICARE beneficiaries and reduce reliance on external healthcare providers. This strategy aligns with global trends in healthcare, where digital tools and AI are being deployed to streamline operations and reduce clinician burnout. For example, the 2025 Deloitte global healthcare outlook highlights the role of AI in administrative efficiency—a principle the DoD could leverage to free up clinical staff for direct patient care.

Yet, political decisions may hinder progress. The administration's focus on reducing federal deficits through mandatory spending cuts—such as site-neutral payment policies for Medicare—could indirectly affect defense sector healthcare. If hospitals face reduced reimbursements, they may cut services or raise costs, limiting access for military families. Similarly, delays in veterans' healthcare funding could exacerbate wait times and reduce satisfaction, further straining workforce morale.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Opportunity

For investors, the defense sector presents both risks and opportunities. Companies that align with workforce modernization—such as those developing AI-driven training platforms or advanced manufacturing technologies—stand to benefit from long-term growth. Conversely, firms reliant on traditional labor models or vulnerable to budget cuts may face headwinds.

Key sectors to monitor include:

1. Defense Contractors with Digital Capabilities: Firms integrating AI and automation into workforce training and operations (e.g., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman).

2. Military Healthcare Providers: Companies like Humana or UnitedHealth Group, which may see increased demand if TRICARE beneficiaries return to military facilities.

3. Workforce Development Platforms: Providers of apprenticeship programs or VR/XR training tools, which are critical for addressing labor shortages.

Investors should also assess geopolitical risks. For example, the Biden Administration's National Security Strategy emphasizes a “whole-of-government” approach to workforce resilience, which could lead to increased funding for defense-related healthcare and training. Conversely, a shift toward austerity or deregulation may prioritize short-term savings over long-term stability.

Conclusion: A Call for Strategic Resilience

The defense sector's ability to navigate political decisions will determine its success in maintaining labor stability and healthcare access. While budget constraints and regulatory shifts pose challenges, they also create opportunities for innovation. Investors who prioritize companies adapting to these dynamics—through digital transformation, workforce development, or strategic partnerships—will be well-positioned to capitalize on the sector's evolution. In an era of geopolitical uncertainty, the defense sector's resilience is not just a national imperative but a compelling investment thesis.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-22 16:56:14.862427

Dear Rusty: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my health care. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years. Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Dear Retired Navy Vet:

First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (www.amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65).

For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military Tricare, you will lose your Tricare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (Tricare requires you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).

Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is there are two “parts” to Medicare - Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services) and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient health care services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your Tricare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your Social Security payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The Social Security earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your Social Security benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit before your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

Once again, thank you for your service to our country.

Finding Mental Health Treatment in Tucson with Tricare So, will Tricare cover mental health treatment in Tucson?","AUGUST 22, 2025 – For many military families and service members living in Arizona, access to quality mental health treatment is a pressing priority.

One of the most common questions that arises is: Will Tricare cover mental health treatment in Tucson?

The short answer is yes. Tricare does provide comprehensive mental health benefits that apply to care in Tucson. However, the exact type of coverage, out-of-pocket costs, and approved providers will depend on your specific Tricare plan, eligibility, and the type of treatment needed.

In this third article in a series on behavioral health topics, MilitarySpot.com helps you understand how Tricare works in Tucson to ensure that you or your loved one can access timely and effective care without any unnecessary barriers.

How Tricare Approaches Mental Health Coverage

Tricare recognizes that mental health care is essential to overall well-being for service members, veterans, and their families. This includes coverage for a wide range of services, such as therapy, inpatient and outpatient treatment, medication management, and specialized programs for conditions like depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders.

Coverage is not limited to emergencies, Tricare supports ongoing mental health needs as well. This is an important distinction, because many families worry that insurance may only step in during a crisis. In fact, Tricare emphasizes preventive care and early intervention to improve outcomes and reduce long-term costs.

Tricare Plans and Mental Health Benefits in Tucson

Residents of Tucson may be enrolled in different Tricare programs depending on their service status and eligibility. Plans such as Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare Reserve Select, and Tricare For Life all provide varying levels of access to mental health services.

For example, Tricare Prime typically requires enrollees to get a referral from their primary care manager before starting specialty care, while Tricare Select offers more flexibility in choosing providers without referrals.

For veterans or retirees who qualify for Tricare For Life, mental health coverage works alongside Medicare. Each of these options influences how you access services in Tucson, particularly when it comes to choosing between military treatment facilities and civilian providers.

Types of Mental Health Treatment Covered by Tricare

One of the most reassuring aspects of Tricare coverage is its breadth.

Mental health services that may be covered in Tucson include individual and group therapy, family counseling, psychiatric evaluations and medication management with a licensed psychiatrist.

Inpatient hospitalization, partial hospitalization programs, residential treatment, and intensive outpatient programs, such as those offered at an accredited Tucson treatment center, are also covered.

For children and adolescents, Tricare often covers developmental or behavioral health therapies when deemed medically necessary. This comprehensive approach ensures that both acute and long-term care are available within the Tucson community.

Accessing Tricare-Covered Care in Tucson

Tucson is home to a mix of military resources and civilian treatment centers. Many Tricare beneficiaries in the area access care through Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, which offers some mental health services.

However, the base may not always meet every family’s needs, especially when specialized care or immediate access is required.

In these cases, Tricare contracts with civilian providers throughout Tucson. This means local hospitals, outpatient clinics, and private practices may all be available, as long as they are within the Tricare network.

Referral and Authorization Requirements

Understanding Tricare’s rules about referrals and authorizations can help you avoid delays in care. For beneficiaries on Tricare Prime, referrals are often required before beginning therapy with a civilian provider.

Emergency mental health situations, such as suicidal thoughts or psychiatric crises, do not require prior authorization. Tricare Select members usually have more direct access but may face higher cost-sharing responsibilities if they choose out-of-network providers.

Before starting treatment, it’s always best to confirm whether your chosen clinic or hospital in Tucson is Tricare-approved.

Court-Ordered Mental Health Treatment in Tucson

In some cases, individuals may be required by the courts to complete a mental health program as part of probation, diversion, or other legal outcomes. In Tucson, these court-ordered mental health treatments can range from counseling sessions to substance use rehabilitation, such as treatment programs offered at a Tucson mental health facility that accepts Tricare.

For military members, veterans, or dependents covered by Tricare, insurance can often be applied if the treatment itself is clinically appropriate and provided by a Tricare-authorized facility. However, there may be additional considerations, such as whether the specific program is within Tricare’s network or whether prior authorization is needed.

Families should confirm with both the court and their Tricare plan to ensure compliance with the legal order and coverage requirements. In many situations, Tricare can significantly reduce or eliminate the financial burden of mandated care, provided the services meet medical necessity criteria and are delivered by approved providers.

Cost Considerations for Families Using TriCare for Mental Health Support

Cost is a major concern for many service members and their families. Tricare generally makes mental health treatment affordable compared to private insurance. With Tricare Prime, there are often little to no copayments for in-network care.

Tricare Select requires copayments or cost-shares, which can vary based on the type of provider and service. For those receiving care at a military treatment facility in Tucson, there is typically no out-of-pocket cost. However, it is important to confirm costs before beginning treatment to avoid unexpected bills, particularly when using civilian providers.

Specialized Programs for PTSD and Trauma

Tucson has a strong network of behavioral health providers who understand the unique needs of military members and their families, especially when it comes to trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Tricare often covers evidence-based therapies for PTSD, including cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).

For veterans or active-duty members struggling with trauma, programs in Tucson can provide both individual counseling and group support, often within facilities that accept Tricare. This ensures continuity of care that addresses both mental health and the specific cultural aspects of military life.

Substance Use Treatment and Tricare Coverage

Another critical aspect of Tricare’s mental health benefits is its coverage of substance use disorder treatment. In Tucson, this can include detoxification, residential rehab, outpatient programs, and medication-assisted treatment.

Given the close link between mental health conditions and substance use, having access to integrated care through Tricare is vital. Families should know that prior authorization may be required for certain levels of care, particularly inpatient and residential programs. Still, the availability of these services under Tricare gives peace of mind to many in the Tucson military community.

Telehealth Options in Tucson

Telehealth has become a valuable option for Tricare beneficiaries, especially in areas where in-person providers may have long wait times. Tricare generally covers telehealth appointments for therapy, medication management, and psychiatric consultations.

For Tucson families, this means expanded access without the burden of commuting across the city or waiting weeks for an opening. Telehealth is especially helpful for dependents balancing school or work commitments, and for those who may not feel comfortable visiting a clinic in person.

Steps to Take if You Need Mental Health Care

If you or a loved one in Tucson needs mental health treatment, the first step is to review your Tricare plan and determine whether a referral is required. Next, identify a provider in the Tricare network using the online directory or through your primary care manager.

For emergencies, seek care immediately at the nearest hospital, Tricare will cover crisis services regardless of prior authorization. Finally, confirm any copayments or cost-shares so you can plan accordingly. These steps ensure a smoother process when starting treatment.

The Importance of Early Support

One of the strongest messages from behavioral health professionals is the importance of addressing concerns early. Waiting until symptoms worsen can make recovery more challenging.

With Tricare’s commitment to covering a full spectrum of mental health services in Tucson, families are encouraged to reach out at the first sign of difficulty. Whether it is a child struggling with anxiety, a spouse coping with depression, or a veteran dealing with trauma, timely access to care makes a significant difference.

Finding Mental Health Treatment in Tucson with Tricare

So, will Tricare cover mental health treatment in Tucson? The answer is yes, with comprehensive benefits that extend across therapy, hospitalization, medication, and specialized programs. The exact details depend on your specific Tricare plan, the type of provider you choose, and whether referrals or authorizations are required.

Tucson residents can take comfort in knowing that resources are available both on base and in the civilian community. Court-ordered treatment may also be covered when it aligns with medical necessity and is provided through an approved program, offering families both legal compliance and access to quality care.

By understanding your plan, confirming coverage, and choosing the right provider, you can access the mental health support you or your family needs with confidence. For more information about local resources and eligibility, we suggest reaching out to providers in your TriCare network (and to stay tuned for more resources from our ongoing series!)",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TRICARE-in-Tucson.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-22 11:56:26.673295

TRICARE covers certain breast pumps and supplies and breastfeeding counseling at no cost for new mothers.

“TRICARE covers these items and services for all TRICARE-eligible female beneficiaries who are at least 27 weeks pregnant,” said Jennifer Stankovic, health systems specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “It doesn’t matter what TRICARE plan you use or your sponsor’s status.”

Are you planning to adopt a baby? If you’re a female beneficiary who legally adopts and intends to personally breastfeed an infant, TRICARE will cover breastfeeding supplies and services for you.

You have options for the types of supplies and services you get and how you get them. Keep reading to learn how TRICARE covers them.

Breast pumps and supplies

TRICARE covers one manual or standard electric breast pump per birth event, including portable pumps. (To get a hospital-grade pump, you need to work with your provider and your regional contractor to get a referral and authorization.)

Here’s how to get a breast pump.

Step 1: Get a prescription.

Your prescription must be from a TRICARE-authorized doctor, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse midwife.

Your prescription must show if you’re getting a basic manual or standard electric pump.

Your prescription doesn’t have to specify a brand.

If you’re going to get a breast pump from a network provider or durable medical equipment supplier, ask your provider to include a diagnosis code on your prescription.

We suggest you make a copy of your prescription for your records.

Step 2: Get a pump.

If you don’t want to pay up front, contact your regional contractor to find a network provider or supplier. You’ll need to show your prescription. You won’t have to file a claim.

If you’re working with a military hospital or clinic to get a breast pump, follow their processes and procedures.

If you don’t mind paying up front, you can go to a TRICARE-authorized provider, supplier, or vendor. (Vendors include retail and online stores.) You won’t need to show your prescription. Be sure to save and copy your receipt so that you can file a claim for reimbursement.

You may choose to purchase a luxury or deluxe pump (meaning those with “luxury or deluxe” features, such as smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, enhanced or expanded rechargeable batteries, or unnecessary accessories). If so, you’d pay the difference between TRICARE’s maximum reimbursement for a standard breast pump and the actual cost of the pump.

Go to Breast Pumps and Supplies to learn about coverage for other supplies, where you can get breast pumps and supplies, and getting reimbursed. Contact your regional contractor for more information.

Breastfeeding counseling

TRICARE covers breastfeeding counseling in two ways:

As part of the care provided during an inpatient maternity stay, a follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or a well-child care visit

Up to six separate outpatient sessions, in addition to any breastfeeding counseling provided during an inpatient stay, follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or well-child care visit, when the counseling is:

Billed as a preventive service

The only service being provided

Provided by a TRICARE-authorized provider, outpatient hospital, or clinic. Types of TRICARE-authorized providers include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives.

Do you have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select? TRICARE’s Childbirth and Breastfeeding Demonstration gives you expanded breastfeeding counseling coverage, as noted in the TRICARE Maternity Care Brochure.

Through the CBSD, you can get outpatient breastfeeding counseling from lactation consultants and lactation counselors. These providers are highly trained, but they aren’t fully licensed medical providers.

The CBSD also covers group breastfeeding counseling.

Sessions with lactation consultants or counselors and group sessions count toward the six total allowed outpatient counseling sessions you have per birth event. You won’t pay anything out of pocket if you use a network provider.

To qualify for this extra coverage, you must:

Have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select. (Note: You aren’t eligible if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.)

Qualify for TRICARE’s breastfeeding support benefit

Do you live in the U.S.? You’re automatically enrolled in the CBSD when you or your provider submits claims covered under the CBSD. Check with your regional contractor to see if you qualify. If you have TRICARE Prime, you’ll need a referral from your primary care manager if you see a non-network provider. Point-of-service charges may apply without the referral.

Do you live overseas? You must register for the CBSD before you get any services. To register, contact the TRICARE overseas contractor.

The CBSD runs through Dec. 31, 2026. Go to Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration to learn more about CBSD eligibility, benefits, and provider types.

Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, legislation to provide premium-free medical insurance coverage for all members of the National Guard and Reserve.
The legislation is supported by National Guard Association of the United States, Wisconsin National Guard Association, Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association, and Reserve Organization of America.
“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad.
Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them.","Roughly 130,000 men and women in the National Guard and Reserve do not have health insurance

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, legislation to provide premium-free medical insurance coverage for all members of the National Guard and Reserve. Sixteen percent of Reserve and National Guard members – roughly 130,000 men and women who have volunteered to serve our country – do not have private health insurance.

“Our service members in the National Guard and Reserve serve and sacrifice for their nation every day – and just like the brave men and women in every other service branch, they deserve and have earned high quality, affordable health care,” said Senator Baldwin. “My bill doesn’t just deliver earned benefits to our troops, it’s also an investment in military readiness to ensure service members get the care they need to stay healthy.”

The Healthcare for Our Troops Act would provide premium-free, zero cost-sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) and address financial barriers to seeking mental health care.

In addition to providing health insurance, the legislation would provide servicemembers with the option to complete annual medical readiness requirements with their preferred civilian provider – giving commanders back valuable training days and saving over $162 million annually in contracted medical assessments. The legislation would also create an incentive for employers to hire Guard and Reserve members by lessening demand for employer-sponsored healthcare plans.

The legislation is supported by National Guard Association of the United States, Wisconsin National Guard Association, Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association, and Reserve Organization of America.

“The Healthcare for Our Troops Legislation is a bipartisan solution that strengthens our military from the ground up. As President of the Wisconsin National Guard Association, I have seen firsthand how a lack of healthcare coverage impacts readiness, retention, and the wellbeing of our Guardsmen and their families. Our service members are asked to do more than ever—responding to domestic emergencies, deploying overseas, filling critical roles. They deserve continuous, no-cost access to healthcare to ensure they remain healthy, resilient, and mission-ready. We are grateful to Senator Baldwin for her leadership and continued advocacy, and we urge Congress to advance this important legislation,” said Jeannie Jeanetta, President of the Wisconsin National Guard Association.

“The Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association (WNGEA) is grateful for the proposal of the Healthcare for our Troops bill, which will ensure that Soldiers and Airmen have access to consistent healthcare when meeting medical readiness requirements. This bill eliminates the need for healthcare transitions when switching between state and federal duty statuses when activated, allowing Guardsmen to focus on the mission instead of worrying about lapses in healthcare. WNGEA is greatly appreciative of Senator Baldwin’s support for the National Guard and the continual emphasis for ensuring military members and their families are provided for,” said the Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Major General Francis M. McGinn, President of the National Guard Association of the United States. “Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access. For less than one percent of the DoD healthcare budget, we can ensure a ready Reserve Component. Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn’t just about rest and rehab—it’s also about eating right.","AUGUST 21, 2025 – Musculoskeletal injuries, such as strains, sprains, fractures, and overuse injuries, are leading causes of limited duty or training restrictions among military personnel. Recovery from these injuries is multifaceted, requiring medical care, modified activity, rest, and an element that is often overlooked—nutrition.

According to Defense Health Agency–Public Health, more than 95% of active duty military personnel’s injuries are musculoskeletal and are the leading reason for military medical visits.

The most common type of musculoskeletal injury found in military health care records is cumulative microtrauma injury, often referred to as overuse injuries, said U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, the Injury Prevention branch chief at DHA-PH.

“It is important for service members to allow injuries to heal completely before returning to duty,” said Lopez. “If an injury is not healed properly, there is an increased risk for another injury. Prior injury is one of strongest predictors for future injury.”

Developing an intentional recovery plan is a key step to returning to full duty.

“Service members need to modify their activities and follow an intentional recovery plan prior to returning to their full duties,” said Lopez.

An important element of the recovery plan is nutritional intervention, said Jennifer Meeks, DHA-PH nutritionist.

“Nutritional interventions will help the injury recovery process by supporting optimal healing,” said Meeks. “The faster a service member or athlete recovers from injury, the quicker they can return to duty or the training field. Optimal nutrition should be the focus to get back to preinjury performance after a musculoskeletal injury.”

Proactive nutrition before an injury focuses on performance nutrition, disease prevention, and immune system enhancement, said Meeks. Reactive nutrition is specific to medical nutrition therapy after injury to control inflammation, rebuild injured tissue, minimize muscle loss, and prevent unwanted weight gain.

“Even if your preinjury eating habits weren’t perfect, a focus on making more healthful choices during your recovery can have tremendous benefits,” said Meeks.

Here are some tips to consider.

1) Energy needs during recovery: During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you’re not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2) Protein: The cornerstone of healing: There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you’re injured, it’s recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It’s best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

Add legumes to your meals: Whether it’s a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It’s also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3) Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal: Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It’s a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4) Fats: friend, not foe: While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5) Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated: While you’re recovering from an injury, it’s best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6) Supplements: use with caution: Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn’t just about rest and rehab—it’s also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you’re recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

The Munson PFPC is still welcoming more volunteers to strengthen the program.

“The PFPC serves as a forum where TRICARE beneficiaries who use Munson partner directly with health center leaders to share feedback, exchange ideas, and shape improvements in care delivery,” said Tim Stevens, Munson’s chief of Quality and Safety, and PFPC council director. “By combining the insight of experienced council members with the perspectives of newcomers, the group strengthens its ability to represent the diverse needs of the Fort Leavenworth community.”

During the meeting, council members reviewed upcoming initiatives, discussed opportunities to enhance the beneficiary experience, and offered feedback on patient services, including:

School and Sports Physicals: This summer, Munson provided more than 1,200 school and sports physicals for military families.

After Hours Clinic: While overall access to care remains good, recent provider and support staff vacancies limit proposed in-person after-hours primary care at this time. The council discussed leveraging virtual and in-person urgent care TRICARE options to supplement after hours services.

Pharmacy: A council member asked if the pharmacy could provide a printed medication guide rather than a QR code. To reduce paper waste, the pharmacy prints prescription information but uses a QR code on the bottle for the manufacturer’s information. Printed copies are available upon request. To save time, request printed information when activating the prescription at the window, through Q-Anywhere, or the call center.

24-hour ScriptCenter access is delayed because interior lobby doors lack after-hours security. A $25,000 renovation is needed to upgrade the hardware, comply with fire and building codes, and allow 24/7 access, shared Stevens.

Leaders emphasized that collaboration with patients is vital to ensuring Munson provides safe, high-quality, patient-centered care.

The council also nominated Ms. Erin Avera to serve as co-chair, representing the patient perspective.

“Bringing together returning and new council members creates a strong foundation for open dialogue,” said Stevens. “Their perspectives guide us as we continue to build trust and improve care for our community.”

Sincerely, The Revere Public Library Board of Trustees","Funding Cuts and the Revere Public Library

Dear Editor,

The following is an open letter from the Revere Public Library (RPL) Board of Trustees to the citizens of Revere and our City, State and Federal elected officials about the current and future impacts on the Revere Public Library, your public library, of recent library-related funding cuts at the Federal level.

Many of you may not realize that your public library is funded in several ways: through the City of Revere budget, the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners (MBLC), and the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). IMLS was recently defunded by Presidential Executive Order#14238 and this letter is about the impact on your public library of the loss of this agency and the funding it administered.

Why does this matter to you as a Revere resident? It’s simple: No dollars from IMLS to MBLC means less funding to the Revere Public Library to help carry out its mission to meet the information and community needs of Revere’s residents of all ages, economic, and educational backgrounds.

It is a common misconception that RPL is simply a large building full of books that can be borrowed. It is so much more. It is where you can bring your children for a story hour and programs that encourage their creativity and skill development, where they make some of their first friends. It is where you can join a book club, participate in a game night with other young adults and engage with other members of the community. It is where you build community across generational and cultural lines. It is where you can use a computer for free and access free wi-fi. It is where you can make photocopies, create your resume, apply for jobs, or make computer printouts for a small fee. It is where you can borrow a reduced cost pass to museums and other local attractions. It is where you can take an ESOL class. It is where you can take a citizenship class. It is where through free online databases a veteran can learn about VA and TRICARE benefits or a senior can learn about assisted living and other housing options, where you can read current news and popular magazines, use business research databases, learn a language, trace your family’s history, download free music and movies, or learn about the job market and potential careers. These services and resources are made available to our community by federal funding through IMLS, which has recently been eliminated. Some resources have already been scaled back or cut entirely due to the loss of this funding.

So, what can you do about this loss of funding? First, you can contact your State and Federal Senators and Representatives (and their aides), testify how your library has impacted you and encourage them to defend the IMLS budget and support your library funding. Second, you can contact the members of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Committee (Labor HHS) to ask them to vote to stop these cuts and reinstate IMLS funding. Lastly, libraries and cultural institutions are on the chopping block with the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018 coming up for reauthorization; we must protect these institutions. You can reach out to your legislators (and their aides) and demand they vote to reauthorise the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018. We have until September 30, when our legislators return from their summer recess, to vote on this crucial legislation. History has shown us that emailing and/or calling your legislator to share your concerns has a definite impact. Visit https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator to get contact information for your Representatives and Senators and https://appropriations.house.gov/subcommittees/labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related-agencies to contact members of the Labor HHS Committee.

Your PCP is your main point of contact for getting health care services, so it's important you find a doctor or provider who you trust, feel comfortable with, and who encourages you to be an active participant in your health care. Don't treat the decision of choosing a PCP lightly. Do some research and don't be afraid to meet with several doctors before you make a decision. Most health insurance plans allow you to switch PCPs whenever you want, so know that you can always change your mind, too.

Find a doctor who works as part of a care team: Find a doctor who works as part of a ""care team,"" where a dedicated group of doctors, nurses, educators, and other health care professionals work together to care for US Family Health Plan members.

See which doctors have been designated as providing high-quality health care: If you're looking for a doctor in Maine, you can check physician ratings at Compare Maine to see which doctors have been designated as providing high-quality health care.

Be sure to search your health plan's Provider Directory: Most health insurance plans have a network of providers you must use to get the best rates. Be sure to search your health plan's Provider Directory and use an in-network doctor when possible. You'll spend much less on your health care services when you do so.

How coverage works

A newborn infant is covered as a TRICARE Prime beneficiary in DEERS for the first 90 days after birth, as long as one additional family member is enrolled in the Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan, or a different TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote plan. Your baby will be conditionally enrolled in the US Family Health Plan for the first 90 days of their life.

The US Family Health Plan will pay claims for covered services your newborn receives from Day 1 through Day 90 under this Conditional Enrollment. You must complete official enrollment on or before day 90 in order to guarantee continuous coverage.

How to enroll

Register your newborn in DEERS to establish TRICARE eligibility.

Submit a completed Enrollment Application to the Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan.

Call the Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan at 1-888-553-3461 as soon as possible after the baby’s birth to notify us of their date of birth. This will help ensure that your child will be conditionally enrolled so we can smoothly process any claims for services your baby receives in the first 90 days.

For additional information and details on enrolling your newborn see:

Depending on your catastrophic cap level and your family's health-care use, you may never meet your catastrophic cap in a year.
Tricare Enrollment Fees Who pays Tricare enrollment fees?
Retirees and their family members who enroll in either Tricare Prime or Tricare Select pay enrollment fees.
Tricare Premiums Who pays Tricare premiums?","One quirk of Tricare is its two different names for the annual, quarterly or monthly fees that beneficiaries may pay. In the civilian world, anything you pay regularly just to have health-care coverage is typically called a premium. But Tricare is different. Depending on your status and plan, you may pay either enrollment fees or premiums.

There are different terms for the categories of money you’ll pay Tricare because each works a little differently.

So what's what, and why should you care? Here’s what you need to know about Tricare fees.

What's a Tricare Catastrophic Cap?

The key difference between enrollment fees and premiums is whether they count toward your catastrophic cap. A catastrophic cap, sometimes called an out-of-pocket maximum, is the most your family will pay for covered care during any calendar year. Once your family reaches your catastrophic cap, Tricare will pay 100% of the Tricare-allowable cost of any covered care for the rest of the year.

The amount of your catastrophic cap depends on:

Which Tricare plan or program you have

Your sponsor's status (active duty, reserve or retired)

Whether your sponsor entered the military before or after Jan. 1, 2018. You can look up your catastrophic cap at the Tricare website.

Depending on your catastrophic cap level and your family's health-care use, you may never meet your catastrophic cap in a year. That's great news because it means you're paying very little for your annual health care. On the flip side, families with higher medical needs may meet their catastrophic cap for the year as early as January, meaning they'll pay nothing for covered health care for the rest of the year.

Either way, your catastrophic cap is important to understand, because it gives you an idea of the most you'll need to spend on covered health care in a year. Many families divide their catastrophic cap by 12 and put that much money in a dedicated savings account each month. Then when you have to pay your deductible or fees for service, you'll have the money available.

Tricare Enrollment Fees

Who pays Tricare enrollment fees? Retirees and their family members who enroll in either Tricare Prime or Tricare Select pay enrollment fees. These costs are annual, but you may pay them on a more frequent schedule, such as monthly, by having them deducted from military retirement pay.

Do Tricare enrollment fees count toward the catastrophic cap? Yes, anything called an enrollment fee counts toward your family's catastrophic cap.

Tricare Premiums

Who pays Tricare premiums? Users of Tricare plans that charge for participation -- besides Prime and Select -- pay premiums (those two charge enrollment fees instead). Premiums apply to Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve, Tricare Young Adult and Continued Health Care Benefit Program plans. Premiums for CHCBP are quarterly, while the other programs charge monthly premiums.

Do Tricare premiums count toward the catastrophic cap? No, anything called a premium does not count toward your family's catastrophic cap. This can be a big deal, because premiums can be fairly expensive, depending on which plan you use.

Not All Plans Have a Cost

If you're an active-duty service member or family member, or if you're on Tricare for Life, you pay neither an enrollment fee nor a premium. Therefore, you must meet your catastrophic cap through fees for service, such as co-payments or cost shares.

Budgeting for health care generally means budgeting for your catastrophic cap. Knowing whether your annual or monthly Tricare expense counts toward your catastrophic cap is an important part of that math. Figure out whether what you pay is an enrollment fee or a premium so you can apply that to your overall figures, and you'll have a better sense of your potential medical costs each year.

TRICARE covers certain breast pumps and supplies and breastfeeding counseling at no cost for new mothers.

“TRICARE covers these items and services for all TRICARE-eligible female beneficiaries who are at least 27 weeks pregnant,” said Jennifer Stankovic, health systems specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “It doesn’t matter what TRICARE plan you use or your sponsor’s status.”

Are you planning to adopt a baby? If you’re a female beneficiary who legally adopts and intends to personally breastfeed an infant, TRICARE will cover breastfeeding supplies and services for you.

You have options for the types of supplies and services you get and how you get them. Keep reading to learn how TRICARE covers them.

Breast pumps and supplies

TRICARE covers one manual or standard electric breast pump per birth event, including portable pumps. (To get a hospital-grade pump, you need to work with your provider and your regional contractor to get a referral and authorization.)

Here’s how to get a breast pump.

Step 1: Get a prescription.

• Your prescription must be from a TRICARE-authorized doctor, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse midwife.

• Your prescription must show if you’re getting a basic manual or standard electric pump.

• Your prescription doesn’t have to specify a brand.

• If you’re going to get a breast pump from a network provider or durable medical equipment supplier, ask your provider to include a diagnosis code on your prescription.

• We suggest you make a copy of your prescription for your records.

Step 2: Get a pump.

• If you don’t want to pay up front, contact your regional contractor to find a network provider or supplier. You’ll need to show your prescription. You won’t have to file a claim.

• If you’re working with a military hospital or clinic to get a breast pump, follow their processes and procedures.

• If you don’t mind paying up front, you can go to a TRICARE-authorized provider, supplier, or vendor. (Vendors include retail and online stores.) You won’t need to show your prescription. Be sure to save and copy your receipt so that you can file a claim for reimbursement.

• You may choose to purchase a luxury or deluxe pump (meaning those with “luxury or deluxe” features, such as smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, enhanced or expanded rechargeable batteries, or unnecessary accessories). If so, you’d pay the difference between TRICARE’s maximum reimbursement for a standard breast pump and the actual cost of the pump.

Go to Breast Pumps and Supplies to learn about coverage for other supplies, where you can get breast pumps and supplies, and getting reimbursed. Contact your regional contractor for more information.

Breastfeeding counseling

TRICARE covers breastfeeding counseling in two ways:

1. As part of the care provided during an inpatient maternity stay, a follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or a well-child care visit

2. Up to six separate outpatient sessions, in addition to any breastfeeding counseling provided during an inpatient stay, follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or well-child care visit, when the counseling is:

o Billed as a preventive service

o The only service being provided

o Provided by a TRICARE-authorized provider, outpatient hospital, or clinic. Types of TRICARE-authorized providers include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives.

Do you have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select? TRICARE’s Childbirth and Breastfeeding Demonstration gives you expanded breastfeeding counseling coverage, as noted in the TRICARE Maternity Care Brochure.

Through the CBSD, you can get outpatient breastfeeding counseling from lactation consultants and lactation counselors. These providers are highly trained, but they aren’t fully licensed medical providers.

The CBSD also covers group breastfeeding counseling.

Sessions with lactation consultants or counselors and group sessions count toward the six total allowed outpatient counseling sessions you have per birth event. You won’t pay anything out of pocket if you use a network provider.

To qualify for this extra coverage, you must:

• Have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select. (Note: You aren’t eligible if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.)

• Qualify for TRICARE’s breastfeeding support benefit

Do you live in the U.S.? You’re automatically enrolled in the CBSD when you or your provider submits claims covered under the CBSD. Check with your regional contractor to see if you qualify. If you have TRICARE Prime, you’ll need a referral from your primary care manager if you see a non-network provider. Point-of-service charges may apply without the referral.

Do you live overseas? You must register for the CBSD before you get any services. To register, contact the TRICARE overseas contractor.

The CBSD runs through Dec. 31, 2026. Go to Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration to learn more about CBSD eligibility, benefits, and provider types.

The TV campaign comes on the heels of Adia Med's entry into the $25 billion wound care market and showcases the company's broader mission to make world-class regenerative therapies accessible in the United States. For years, many Americans traveled abroad to receive high-quality stem cell treatments, believing they were unavailable domestically. Adia Med is proving that is no longer the case - delivering safe, effective, and U.S.-based regenerative therapies supported by advanced protocols and comprehensive patient care.

""This nationwide commercial is about showing patients they don't need to leave the country to get access to cutting-edge regenerative medicine,"" said Larry Powalisz, CEO of Adia Nutrition Inc. ""It's available right here at home, and we're doing it in a way that meets the highest U.S. medical standards. For patients, it means better access and peace of mind. For investors, it represents a growing market opportunity that we are well-positioned to lead.""

Momentum is also being supported by favorable policy trends, including Florida's passage of SB1768, which formally recognizes the regenerative benefits of stem cell therapy. This legislation underscores the growing legitimacy of regenerative medicine in the U.S. and strengthens Adia Med's position as a pioneer in the field.

The new commercial, airing on major TV networks, presents Adia Med as a destination clinic for regenerative healthcare. Treatments focus on accelerating recovery, improving mobility, and enhancing quality of life, while avoiding the need for costly and burdensome medical travel abroad.

Adia Med is currently an in-network provider with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna, with an active filing underway with TRICARE to broaden access further. The campaign is both a brand-building milestone and a patient acquisition engine, reinforcing Adia's mission to deliver regenerative therapies that are accessible, affordable, and nationally recognized.

Clinic owners and healthcare practitioners interested in licensing the Adia Med name or integrating Adia's regenerative therapies into their practice are encouraged to reach out directly. Strategic partnerships are welcomed as part of Adia's continued mission to expand access to advanced stem cell solutions.

The option “represents an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,” Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency, said in a news release. “The data we get from this demonstration will inform future Tricare innovations nationwide.”

The three-year demo begins in January. Managed by CareSource Military and Veterans, enrollees will get care from CareSource’s network of primary and specialty care providers. The demo will provide Tricare Prime coverage to over 146,000 beneficiaries across both cities, Military.com reported.

The demo aims to bring more health care choices to eligible individuals. Participants enrolled in the Tricare Prime Demo will keep comprehensive Tricare coverage with a few differences from the traditional Tricare Prime.

Participants will have their Tricare Prime enrollment fee waived for the first year of the demo. After that, retirees, their family members and survivors will pay enrollment fees.

Enrollees will not need referrals to see network providers, but they can only get care at a military hospital or clinic in an emergency. They also will not be able to use the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line, but CareSource has its own advice line for beneficiaries, according to the news release.

Only participants who live within the designated geographic areas of the Atlanta and Tampa Bay metropolitan areas and have an active-duty, activated National Guard or Reserve or retired family member are eligible.

In the episode about online scams, Carol Kando-Pineda, Counsel with the Federal Trade Commission’s Division of Consumer and Business Education, educates listeners on scams that use artificial intelligence, text messages and tempting financial investment opportunities.
Having open, honest conversations about money and spending habits can also protect you and your Family against financial scams by fostering trust, teamwork and unity.","When was the last time you passively scrolled through an online community board? While it’s possible you didn’t feel in danger while scoping out secondhand furniture or a rental unit in preparation for your next move, it's important to be aware that scammers could be trying to take advantage of unsuspecting individuals.

Financial readiness often involves understanding how to effectively engage with the marketplace, recognizing and avoiding fraud and scams, and making informed financial choices to establish a stable financial future. Fraudsters may target Soldiers and their Families during high-stress periods, such as deployment transitions or permanent change of station season. Research from the Better Business Bureau Institute shows that military consumers reported a higher median dollar loss to scams than nonmilitary consumers. Between 2019 and 2024, the BBB received 273,937 complaints from military customers.

“Knowing how to spot and avoid scams is a first line of defense,” said Dr. Cindy Morita, Acting Financial Readiness Program/Family Advocacy Program Manager.

Watch out for some of the top rip-offs, including fake rental listings, phishing attempts and investment frauds.

Fake PCS rental listings targeting service members. Scammers post homes for rent online, requiring advance payments for properties they don’t own.

Phishing scams. Emails or text messages from individuals pretending to be officials from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service or Tricare requesting personal or banking information and demanding payments. Do not click on any links or respond by providing personal information. Stay safe by contacting the organization directly.

Investment fraud. Promises of high returns that turn out to be pyramid or cryptocurrency schemes. Morita said to always conduct research before you invest.

Choosing a safe payment method could be an effective, simple step against scams. Some payment methods offer little or no protection against fraud. Cryptocurrency, payment apps, wire-transfer companies and gift cards offer less fraud protection. These options can make it difficult to recover your money. Credit cards usually offer stronger fraud protection.

Access to trustworthy resources that educate Soldiers and Army Families about financial scams can also help safeguard their economic well-being. Military Consumer is a program designed for the military community. The website offers free resources to help teach individuals about fraud and assist them in making informed financial decisions. The Military OneSource podcast series also provides an episode on prevalent scams affecting service members. In the episode about online scams, Carol Kando-Pineda, Counsel with the Federal Trade Commission’s Division of Consumer and Business Education, educates listeners on scams that use artificial intelligence, text messages and tempting financial investment opportunities.

Having open, honest conversations about money and spending habits can also protect you and your Family against financial scams by fostering trust, teamwork and unity.

“When Families communicate about finances, they work together to set goals and solve problems, which builds resilience on every level,” said Morita.

The Financial Readiness Program aims to empower Soldiers and Families with the knowledge, tools and resources needed to achieve financial resilience and independence by helping individuals to not only manage their finances but also prepare for unexpected circumstances.",http://www.army.mil/,N,0.0,2025-08-21 09:56:11.478148

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis investigated NVG-291-R as a potential novel treatment in clinically relevant rodent models of both moderate and severe peripheral nerve injury (PNI).

Improved Neuromuscular Function and Axonal Regeneration: In moderate and severe models of PNI, daily subcutaneous NVG-291-R treatment led to statistically significant improvements in neuromuscular function and axonal regrowth. Increases in compound muscle action potentials and specific tetanic force were associated with a higher total number and density of axons distal to the injury site. Functional and regenerative gains were observed as early as 4 weeks post-injury.

""Peripheral nerve injuries can be life altering and are a major barrier to return-to-duty for our military personnel,"" said Dr. Wilson Ray, MD, a neurosurgeon and lead investigator from WashU Medicine. ""Combat-sustained PNIs have increased in both frequency and severity in recent years, yet there remain no effective or reparative treatments.

These findings in both the auditory and peripheral nervous systems further support the broad therapeutic potential of NVG-291 across multiple neurological conditions. These studies, presented at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium, reinforce NVG-291's ability to accelerate nervous system repair in clinically relevant models of military-related nerve damage.

""We are demonstrating a consistent ability to promote nervous system repair, whether in the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, or the delicate structures of the inner ear,"" said Dr. Marc DePaul, Director of Research at NervGen Pharma. ""These robust findings strengthen our commitment to advancing NVG-291 into further clinical studies and bringing a new class of restorative medicine to individuals in need.""

About NVG-291

NervGen holds exclusive worldwide rights to NVG-291, a first- and potential best-in-class neuroreparative therapeutic peptide targeting nervous system repair. NVG-291's technology is licensed from Case Western Reserve University and is based on academic studies that demonstrated the preclinical efficacy of NVG-291-R, the rodent variant of NVG-291, in animal models of spinal cord injury. These studies implicated multiple potential molecular and cellular mechanisms by which NVG-291-R promotes neurorepair and functional improvement in both central and peripheral nervous system injury models. The implicated mechanisms include the promotion of neuronal sprouting, or plasticity, remyelination, and promotion of a non-inflammatory phenotype in the microglial cells. NervGen has received Fast Track designation from the FDA and Orphan Designation from the EMA for NVG-291 in individuals living with spinal cord injury.

Earnings vs. Forecast

Zynex’s earnings fell significantly short of analyst expectations, with a surprise EPS miss of 230%. The revenue shortfall of 18.55% further compounded investor concerns, marking a notable deviation from past performance. This quarter’s results highlight the company’s ongoing struggles to stabilize its financial health amid operational restructuring.

Market Reaction

The market’s response to Zynex’s earnings report was swift and severe. The stock’s after-hours tumble of 49.2% reflects investor disappointment and uncertainty about the company’s future trajectory. This dramatic drop places the stock near its 52-week low of 1.23 USD, suggesting a challenging road ahead for recovery.

Outlook & Guidance

With the appointment of new CEO Steven Dyson, Zynex has suspended its quarterly guidance as it reassesses its strategic direction.

Full transcript - Zynex Inc (ZYXI) Q2 2025:

Conference Operator: Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zynex Second Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer of Zynix.

Please go ahead.

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released financial results for the second quarter ended 06/30/2025. A copy of the press release is available on the company’s website. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward looking statements regarding events. We encourage you to review the company’s past and future filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the company’s 2024 Form 10 ks and subsequent Form 10 Qs, along with any amendments, which identify the specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward looking statements.

These factors may include, without limitation, statements regarding product development, product potential, the regulatory and legal environment, sales and marketing strategies, capital resources, or other operating performance. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the second quarter twenty twenty five earnings call. With me today are Anna Loxock, our Chief Operating Officer Don Gregg, President of Xanax Monitoring and Dan Moorhead, our Chief Financial Officer. Anna will provide an update on our initiatives in the pain management division, and Don Gregg will discuss how far we have come in our patient monitoring division and our recent submission to the FDA for our Neko pulse oximeter. Dan will go through the second quarter’s financial results.

The 2025 was dominated by many improvements centered around refocusing our pain management business model, not only reshaping our sales force and redirecting them to slightly different call points, but also trans transforming our corporate structures to better reflect and streamline operations. Later this year and into the next year, we’ll see the impact of this effort. We’re seeing a reduction to overall expenses of approximately $40,000,000 annualized and a more efficient use of our inventories, better supply chain management, a more diversified prescriber and payer customer base, all in support for our goal to return to positive cash flow by the end of this year. We recently announced the addition of Steven Dyson as our new CEO. And Steven brings over twenty five years of experience in the medical technology sector primarily through his leadership at APAX, a global private equity firm.

Steven brings deep expertise and a proven track record in the medical sector. His leadership will be helpful as we refocus our business strategy toward a more optimized payer mix and work to return Xynix to a strong growth trajectory. His start date is August 18, and I look forward to working with him in my new role as just chairman of the board. I should also mention that he and I are very aligned on all the major things that needs to get done. In another also important development, Dan Moorhead, our CFO of AGS has recently signed as announced in our eight ks filing two days ago.

He is on the call today and available to answer questions. As soon as we have a replacement appointed, we’ll update everyone immediately, of course. As I’m sure most of our listeners know, we submitted the FDA application on our Neko laser pulse oximeter back in May. This product marks a historic milestone in the evolution of pulse oximetry and is a major game changer in our mission to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes with unique breakthrough technologies in our hospital monitoring division. We’re encouraged by the early attention we have received from the FDA and the line of questions we have answered already.

We expect at least one more round of questions that will take several months before clearance. Don will provide you with more details on this exciting development. And the TRICARE temporary payment suspension is still ongoing, and it’s hard to predict exactly how long it would take before we have a resolution to this. We are obviously hopeful that it will be sooner rather than later. We are actively cooperating with DHA and TRICARE in their claims reviews, and we are advocating proposition of the payment suspension.

In support of TRICARE’s goals of patient care, we have also agreed to continue servicing existing TRICARE patients, and we are honoring prescriptions for new patients. While we are working on a resolution for TRICARE, we are redirecting our focus to fully operate without relying on TRICARE’s revenue. We are committed to diversifying our revenue streams even more. And during the quarter, we continued our efforts to refocus our sales force and operations to reflect the current landscape of insurance coverage and have made significant strides towards improving cash flow. This has included several efficiency improvements in our internal operations, relocating staff to more profitable business units, reducing our cost of goods sold, updating our sales management structures while driving the sales force in the field to become more efficient and productive.

Our efforts to redirect our sales force and reduce expenses internally are beginning to take effect now. And over the next several quarters, it will naturally show as improvements to our bottom line. We reported net revenue of 22,000,000 in the quarter, while we collected $26,000,000 in cash in the second quarter. We posted a net loss of $20,000,000 while more than half of that was due to a noncash adjustment to our tax allowance. We strongly believe in our commitment to help patients with the best product for pain relief without side effects that are associated typically with opioids.

We are confident that our efforts to reduce costs and redirecting our sales force will be pivotal to improve cash flow and create a foundation for continuing to grow into the huge demand for our products. Our revenue is becoming more diversified with increased call points, increasing sales of other products, technologies and more end users. We are very optimistic about the future of Sinax as we have proven to be a business that can grow profitably. I’ll now turn the call over to Anna Luxoft to provide a more detailed update on the operations. Anna?

Anna Loxock, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: Thank you, Thomas. As Thomas mentioned, we were notified by TRICARE that the temporary suspension of payments will continue as they complete their review. We continue to remain an in network provider and service existing and new TRICARE patients as directed by DHA. In June, we decreased overall staff by an additional 14%, mostly in our corporate office. We anticipate this, along with previous expense reductions, will result in an annual savings up to $40,000,000 As part of the restructure and based on payer performance analysis, we’ve categorized payers into different tiers and are actively shifting our focus to the most favorable segments.

As a result, we’ve rightsized shipments for orders and adjusted sales commissions to reflect performance. Internally, we’ve eliminated close to 90 corporate roles, replacing them with more cost effective outsourced teams. These actions are expected to reduce expenses while allowing our teams to focus more efficiently on our core business on a monthly basis. While we anticipate a near term impact on revenue primarily within our supply segments, it reinforces our patient centric approach and strengthens our ability to build and sustain long term value based relationships with payers. We believe this strategy will drive greater patient outcomes and operational sustainability over time.

We’ve undertaken a comprehensive realignment of our sales force to drive productivity and position the organization for long term growth. One of the key initiatives has been resetting our sales organization to better align objectives. In parallel, we’ve restructured the sales team by reducing the overall headcount and exiting sales reps that don’t meet our standards. We also streamlined our organizational structure by removing redundancies, which has allowed for oversight and support from senior leadership. This leaner structure empowers leadership to stay focused on the metrics that matter for the business and performance indicators that enable faster identification of coaching opportunities to ensure every individual representing our company represents our values.

Additionally, we revamped our sales compensation model to drive a performance focused culture that meets the company’s objectives for good patient care and experience and regulatory compliance. High performing sales employees are now rewarded with increased base pay, while mid tier performers are incentivized to improve their clearly defined targets. This approach not only drives accountability, but ultimately creates a clear pathway for reps to appropriately grow their earnings as they deliver better business outcomes through better patient experience. Long term, our objective remains unchanged. We aim to fully staff all 800 sales territories with highly capable data driven representatives.

We believe this focused and disciplined strategy will allow us to serve our patients more effectively and deliver consistent profitable growth. I’ll now turn the call over to Don Greig to provide a more detailed update on the patient monitoring business. Don?

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: Thank you, Anna. I want to provide an additional update on the progress of our Nico pulse oximeter and the overall market opportunities for this product. We successfully submitted Nico to the FDA in May, and there has been initial interactive review with the FDA. We are expecting an additional information request in August and an overall six month clearance process. Last quarter, I spent some time explaining why we are well positioned with this technology and the massive opportunity we believe is in front of us.

Clinical results show the Nikko laser technology is superior to LED pulse oximeters currently in the market today as they have severe accuracy issues in patients with darker skin, elevated carbon monoxide or meth hemoglobin in the bloodstream, and especially those with low levels of blood oxygen. There are very few clinical procedures that do not use pulse oximetry. Skin pigmentation have been shown to alter the oxygen measurement displayed when using LED based pulse oximetry, resulting in biases which can have negative impacts on patient care and outcomes. These accuracy issues are on the FDA agenda and have resulted in device manufacturer litigation to date. Numerous clinical publications prove LED based pulse oximeters that are on the market today are inaccurate on darker skin.

Given this, 25 attorney generals in the US senate requested FDA to address pigmentation bias. As a result of this, the FDA funded open oximetry to improve the safety and precision of pulse oximeters that openly published their testing results. Multiple FDA panel meetings resulted in a new draft guidance issued in January 2025 in which our technology conforms to that guidance. The Nico pulse oximeter recently submitted to the FDA is powered by patent protected laser technology that has been validated to solve the accuracy issues of LED technology in a clinical study at Duke University. Laser pulse oximetry is not biased, allowing for more accurate readings across all individuals regardless of skin pigmentation, elevated carbon monoxide, or methohemoglobin in the bloodstream, and especially those with low levels of blood oxygen.

More accurate data results and improved care and better patient outcomes. We believe our Nico pulse oximeter will provide reliable and equitable care for all. In addition to solving current LED based pulse oximeter technology accuracy issues, the Niko technology platform is poised to unlock the $1,000,000,000 invasive lab based co oximetry market with non invasive laser pulse oximetry technology by bringing it directly to the bedside with instant results and shifting the standard of care. Co oximetry is a critical diagnostic tool for emergency room and hospital patients to determine their treatment pathway. Current co oximetry technology is lab based for the most part, uses similar laser spectrometry technology, and suffers from a number of drawbacks that affect patient outcomes and high hospital cost.

Cocoaximetry measurements require a blood draw today, which is painful and risks infection. Patients wait for results from the lab, which reduces the ability to select appropriate treatment in a timely fashion. These labs are sometimes off-site and result in lengthy delays. It’s also a more expensive approach due to hospital lab processes and high cost consumables. The Neko platform uses needle free, patent protected laser technology to deliver instant, continuous, and low cost results at the bedside to unlock this opportunity.

To close, we submitted NECO to the FDA in May, and we expect approval to take approximately six months from receipt of an additional of an FDA additional information request that’s scheduled for August. Patient monitoring is a multibillion dollar market, approximately 3 and a half billion globally, that we believe NECO will enter as a superior product that can meaningfully improve care to the broadest range of patient patients when they need it most. Zynex is pushing to be a key industry partner and leader to all clinicians and further demonstrate how Nico’s laser pulse oximetry technology inherently solves the current market challenges, especially accuracy and skin pigmentation bias, while improving the field of patient monitoring. I will now turn the call over to Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, for a more in-depth look at the quarter’s financial performance.

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: Thanks, Don. Please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the second quarter ended 06/30/2025. Net revenue was $22,300,000 compared to $49,900,000 in the 2024. Device revenue was $11,000,000 and supplies revenue was 11,300,000.0 The revenue decline was primarily attributable to the temporary payment suspension from TRICARE and slowing order growth, which was impacted by sales force reductions, shipping policy adjustments and the redirection of the sales force activity. Gross profit in the second quarter was $15,200,000 or 68% of revenue as compared to $39,900,000 or 80% of revenue in Q2 twenty twenty four.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 45% to $12,800,000 in the 2025. The primary contributor to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was our headcount reduction as we continue to focus on sales rep productivity. G and A expenses were $12,700,000 in the 2025 compared to $14,500,000 last year. Net loss was $20,000,000 and $0.66 per share in the 2025 compared to net income of $1,200,000 in Q2 twenty twenty four. As Thomas mentioned, included in our net loss is a noncash charge of $10,300,000 or $0.34 per share related to an allowance on our deferred tax assets.

Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended 06/30/2025, was $8,900,000 as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3,500,000 in the quarter ended 06/30/2024. On the balance sheet, we had $17,500,000 of cash on hand at 06/30/2025, and were able to reduce our cash burn significantly in Q2. We expect it to be even less in Q3. Our convertible debt of $60,000,000 is due in May 2026, so you’ll notice it’s now a current liability. We are currently working with our advisers to refinance this liability.

With that, I’ll now turn it back over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. Thank you, Dan. In terms of forward looking guidance, we have decided to suspend quarterly guidance while we are onboarding our new CEO and looking to appoint a new CFO following Dan’s announced departure. Stephen Dyson, the incoming CEO, will lead a review of the company’s forecasting procedures and will provide an update to investors on the potential resumption of guidance in the coming quarters. Our mission is to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from debilitating pain and illness by providing the highest technology and service standards.

In pain management, we do this by providing a non opioid alternative to pain management. And our monitoring division aims to measure data more accurately across patients and provide a more equitable healthcare outcome. We continue to adjust the cost structure as needed and will soon get back to a strong growth trajectory. Looking forward, we believe we have additional call points and revenue streams that can drive further growth. We have always shown an ability to adjust to market, customer and reimbursement changes and continue investing and refocusing our business.

With that, let’s open the call up for questions.

Conference Operator: Thank you, sir. And if you’re using a speakerphone, please lift the handset first before pressing any keys. Please go ahead and press star one now if you have any questions. And your first question will be from Jeffrey Cohen at Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Oh, hello, folks. How are doing? Few questions from our end. I guess, firstly, I just wanna review and recap with, Don on Nico. So the initial submission was May.

August is when you expect to return questions back to the FDA, or is August when you expect to hear back from them again and remind us on anticipated approval. Would it be closer to October or December?

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I we’ve been in dialogue with FDA in what’s called an interactive review. We’ve received multiple discussion questions and dialogue with them. We’re expecting an AI, which should be in August.

And then we are anticipating six months from then clearance. Depending on what is in the AI based on what we’ve already had discussions with FDA regarding, I would expect that clearance would be closer to that December time frame.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. And you feel confident that there won’t be a second AI iteration?

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: Well, nobody really knows exactly what the FDA might do in that case, but we have forecasted AI questions. We’ve got responses ready for those, and we feel pretty confident in our submission to the FDA given all the work that we’ve done over the past several years.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then secondly, could you talk about TRICARE a little further as far as next steps and timelines as far as the next iteration when you may meet or have some news about the relationship there. And then maybe talk a little bit about those patients and their patients and referrals.

So TRICARE still referring patients to you that flows continued or perhaps diminished, and are those patients going on therapy or alternatively going elsewhere?

Anna Loxock, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: So we don’t have any information about TRICARE payment suspension next steps at this point and when and if it’s going to get resolved. But we continue to service TRICARE patients, existing and new patients. The inflow of patients has reduced a little bit just as a result of reduced sales rep headcount by about half.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Got it. And then lastly for Dan, perhaps talk a little bit about the sales and more or sales and marketing line and or the G and A line as far as the back half of the year and how those in the last two quarters may compare with q two and where you ended up q two?

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: Yes. I think, you know, you’ll see continued reductions. We made, you know, the second of our cost reductions were done in June, and so you didn’t really get the full effect of those. So on the sales side, I think you’re gonna continue to see a decrease probably down another 15 to 20% in q three, and then I think it probably flattens out for the rest of the year. And then on the g and a side, it’s probably closer to a 10 to 12% decrease from q two to ’3 and then again flattening out.

But you’ll really start to see the full effect of the cost reductions starting in Q3.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. Perfect. That does it for us. Thanks for taking the questions. Thank

Conference Operator: you. Next question will be from Yi Chen at H. C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.

Eduardo, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Hi there. This is Eduardo on for Yi. Thanks for taking the question. Do have you any more details on the nature of the data request from the FDA? You mentioned that you’ve done some preparation already to anticipate those questions.

Just kind of get some color on any hesitations they might have or whether they’re looking for more detail in the technology.

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: You know, I think that the FDA, Yuchen, is definitely concerned about LED technology. They wanna ensure that our technology and our clinical trial performs as good as or or or better than LED technology. They’ve also you know, we’ve had a lot of dialogue on claims positioning of it because it is a different light source technology, things like that. And I’m anticipating that, you know, they’re they will continue to review our clinical data. They will continue to review our claims to ensure where this is positioned properly for those claims, etcetera, etcetera.

And so we are well prepared to talk through this with them and to respond in a very quick manner around that because we’d like to get clearance as soon as possible.

Eduardo, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Thanks. That’s really helpful. And I guess curious, I know it might be a little early. Any conversations with the new CEO and possible initiatives or strategies either on the commercial side or the reimbursement side, that you guys might have moving forward?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. Obviously, I’ve had a close dialogue with Steven Dyson. And the rest of the leadership team is also engaged in basically making sure that things that come up at this point in time that we’re all aligned, all these initiatives to refocus on the pain management side, we’re fully aligned on. And it it fits well what, what he’s good at, sorting sorting out a difficult situation and make sure that the valuation of the company over the next several years will will be much better than it is today.

Conference Operator: Next question will be from Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets: I guess just a couple of questions for me. Could you touch on why revenue came in below the recently provided guidance? I understand it was due to TRICARE and some of the sales force reduction. But beyond that, was there anything incremental that drove the sort of low visibility coming into the quarter? Thank you.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. That’s the third component in that we shipped less supplies in the second quarter than we had in prior quarters, simply as a result of the insurance companies that we are now servicing the allowable and the initiatives we have to have even closer contact with patients as to their the actual needs of supplies. I don’t know if you have anything to add.

Anna Loxock, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: Well, we’ve continued to we continue to implement a utilization management control program in place to ensure better patient outcome that continues to impact our supply shipments to patients.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you very much. And maybe on TRICARE, you talked about how, you know, you’re still servicing some of these patients when you know that payments aren’t necessarily gonna be coming in at this time. Is is there a reason why you’re still servicing them? And and perhaps have you thought about perhaps reallocating resources elsewhere?

And maybe can you help us think about what Zynex could look like at TRICARE? Thank you.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yeah. TRICARE specifically or DHA with TRICARE has specifically asked us in during this process here to to continue to service the patients and and new patients as well. So annoying and hostile of a situation as it is, we’re obviously doing our best to try to play ball and take good care of patients as as we receive those prescriptions. So that’s that’s that’s part of basically dealing dealing with this situation here. It’s it’s it’s something that’s obviously costing us some money with no revenue, and we we will continue to evaluate whether we do that.

But as Anna mentioned earlier, the the number of new orders we are getting has dropped significantly as a result of refocusing our sales force, And that that helps a little bit on that equation.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you very much. And, yeah, this was Movan Sur on for Ashish.

Conference Operator: Thank you. And at this time, Mr. Sandgaard, we have no further questions registered. Please proceed.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. Thank you for joining us today. We obviously didn’t see the performance that we had expected here this past quarter. However, I’m very pleased with our plan of improvement and the actions that we have already taken. We appreciate your time and interest in Sinax, and have a great day.

Conference Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Tricare coverage is a program for active-duty service members and their families, whereas VADIP is geared toward veterans and their close family members. Both programs partner with dental insurance companies. (VADIP works with Delta Dental and MetLife, whereas Tricare is through United Healthcare.)

If you are eligible for benefits, you can review available plans and get an idea of the sort of coverage you might be able to enjoy. Every plan is unique, so it is important to pay attention to whether a specific policy will meet your needs. For example, some people already have excellent oral health and need only basic coverage, while others may need a premium plan that covers more extensive care.

Often, plans provide robust coverage for preventive services, such as cleanings, exams, and X-rays. Coverage for restorative care, such as fillings, crowns and dentures, might be more limited. However, you may still enjoy up to 50 – 80% coverage for such services.

About Defense Health Network Pacific Rim: Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR) is one of the Defense Health Agency’s nine networks of hospitals and clinics that deliver high-quality health care to more than 140,000 enrolled beneficiaries, supporting major operational units through the Indo-Pacific.","Leaders at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), part of the Defense Health Agency’s Defense Health Network Pacific Rim, welcomed U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (MI-01) on Aug. 11 for an official visit focused on readiness, health care delivery, and an innovative program that is transforming warfighter readiness and patients’ lives.

Bergman, a retired U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant general who serves on the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees and chairs the House Budget Committee Oversight Task Force, spent part of his morning holding a town hall with staff and meeting with key members of NMCSD’s leadership team.

At the town hall, while discussing the importance of leveraging technology to improve patient outcomes, Bergman said, “One of my biggest concerns, and has been for a long time, is dental readiness.”

The congressman emphasized the important connection between dental rehabilitation and warfighter readiness. “We can make so much improvement there because when our folks look in the mirror and smile...it builds not only physical health but also mental health,” Bergman said.

Bergman’s emphasis on dental rehabilitation and its impact on warfighter readiness underscored another reason for his visit, which was to learn more about NMCSD’s Maxillofacial Restoration Program. Cmdr. Daniel Hammer, oral maxillofacial surgeon and program manager, briefed the congressman on this comprehensive, first of its kind, team-based initiative that integrates advanced surgical techniques with dental rehabilitation to restore health and function to patients recovering from significant facial injuries or conditions ranging from cancer to congenital anomalies.

“During Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, head and neck injuries were actually the second most common injuries after extremity wounds,” said Hammer. “Yet there were no centers of excellence created to sustain care, no registries were established to track outcomes, and very few warfighters were able to have dental rehabilitation, which led to poor speech, swallowing and psychological outcomes. Our program is closing that gap, ensuring service members regain the ability to speak, swallow, and return to duty, restored with purpose.”

Since launching in 2020, the program has treated more than 60 patients with complex facial trauma, head and neck cancer, and severe dental injuries, achieving extraordinary results that support force readiness and long-term wellness for military beneficiaries.

NMCSD’s integrated model brings together more than 125 specialists across nine clinical care pathways, ensuring that every aspect of recovery, from surgery and dental rehabilitation to speech therapy and pain management, is coordinated from day one. The program’s outcomes include:

• 94% return-to-duty rate for active duty service members

• Hospital stays under seven days (compared to the national average of 12–13 days)

• More than 95% of patients discharged with the ability to eat by mouth without feeding tubes

• Minimal pain medication required post-surgery (several patients never require narcotics after surgery)

• Full dental rehabilitation included as part of the surgical plan

• Typical return to full duty within 16 weeks

During his visit, Bergman toured the departments that provide integrated support for the Maxillofacial Restoration Program, including the oral maxillofacial surgery department, hospital dentistry department, pain medicine clinic, and C5 (comprehensive combat and complex casualty care). He also visited the Defense Health Agency’s regional dental lab at Naval Base San Diego where the team fabricates dental appliances and prostheses.

“What sets our Maxillofacial Restoration Program apart is that we don’t just perform surgery, we restore health, function, and quality of life,” said Hammer. “It’s a complete, end-to-end model with no civilian equivalent. From the first consult through full recovery, we are with our patients every step of the way.”

NMCSD’s program is one of the few in the country to offer “Jaw in a Day,” a procedure that combines immediate jaw reconstruction with 3D-printed dental implants, all completed in a single surgery. Hammer’s team at NMCSD performed the DoD’s first such procedure and has now completed more than 30.

The Maxillofacial Restoration Program treats active duty service members from all branches, military retirees, and other TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries, with no out-of-pocket cost for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime.

“We were honored to host Representative Bergman and highlight how we are setting a new standard for what’s possible in facial restoration,” said Capt. Elizabeth Adriano, NMCSD director and Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command San Diego commander. “The innovation, skill, and dedication of this team ensures every patient, every warfighter receives the most comprehensive care available in military medicine.”

During the town hall earlier in the day, Bergman spoke about need for a shared commitment to achieve mission success.

“In any organization, whether military, civilian, government, or private, you have to ask, what’s the most important thing we are here to do?” Bergman said. “In the military, it’s to provide for our national defense and bring together the men and women who choose to serve, in uniform or as civilians, as part of a team focused on one thing: the success of the mission. That mission only succeeds when every person is committed to it.”

It’s that same ethos that is embraced by the maxillofacial restoration team and embodied in the approach NMCSD’s staff take to readiness and patient care.

Tahsin Chowdhury, primary care noncommissioned officer in charge at McNair Army Health Clinic, stressed the importance of service members staying up to date on medical checkups and records.
“Rodeos give health care personnel the opportunity to maintain and sharpen their clinical and administrative skills,” Henderson said.
Max Cross, a medic Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center in Fort Meade, Maryland, supported the event to keep service members “ready and rapidly deployable at all times,” he said.
That’s why we hammer in readiness.” At the core of the health readiness rodeo, Chowdhury said, is for all to stay ready for the mission.","National Defense University at Fort Lesley J. McNair hosted a health readiness rodeo on Aug. 4, 2025, welcoming new students as well all service members from across the joint task force–National Capital Region. Rodeos serve as a one-stop shop for staying medically current on exams, immunizations, labs, and profiles, ensuring warfighters can deploy at a moment’s notice.

By 10 a.m., areas of Marshall Hall operated as an efficient flow system, guiding service members from intake to care stations—starting at the registrar for check-in. U.S. Army Capt. Latasha Henderson, clinical nurse officer in charge at Fort McNair Army Health Clinic and detachment officer in charge at Andrew Rader Army Health Clinic, explained, “If they’re not enrolled or don’t have access to (MHS) GENESIS, our representative gets them registered into the electronic health record.” MHS GENESIS is the secure website for 24/7 access to health information, including managing appointments and exchanging messages with your healthcare team.

Comprehensive, efficient care to stay ready

After check-in, service members moved to a station where a record reviewer thoroughly assessed their charts to identify needs for preventive care, such as mammograms, colon cancer screenings, mental health support, or medication refills. Reviewers flagged any issues and referred them to a healthcare provider in the next stage of the rodeo. Providers then addressed those needs on the same day, either by delivering care on site or scheduling future appointments.

U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Tahsin Chowdhury, primary care noncommissioned officer in charge at McNair Army Health Clinic, stressed the importance of service members staying up to date on medical checkups and records. “Let’s say we’re downrange, deployed in theater, and there are dental problems. Now, we have to pull that soldier out of the fight, fly them out of theater to get the care they need, and then fly them back in.”

Readiness rodeos also function as a training ground for medics. “Rodeos give health care personnel the opportunity to maintain and sharpen their clinical and administrative skills,” Henderson said. “They practice mass-readiness operations, which mirror real-world scenarios—making them better prepared for large-scale missions or deployments.”

U.S. Army Spc. Max Cross, a medic Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center in Fort Meade, Maryland, supported the event to keep service members “ready and rapidly deployable at all times,” he said. “It’s our job to make sure they have all vaccines up to date.”

“We’re making sure everybody has proper eyewear, that their hearing is good, and that everyone is 100% ready for whatever they’re going to tackle the next day. The medic is there for emotional help, physical help—they’re the jack of all trades,” he added.

Foundation of trust, regardless of rank

Aside from providing these vital health assessments and follow-up care, the rodeo also cultivated an element of trust between patient and provider.

“Warfighters need to trust that medics will keep them healthy, treat injuries quickly and manage conditions effectively,” Henderson said. “This trust allows them to focus on the mission, knowing their medical team has their back when it matters most.”

Medical staff worked at various provider stations to assist service members progressing through the rodeo. In one room, several sat wearing wireless headphones connected to a tablet that conducted hearing tests out of the traditional sound booth. In another, service members received immunizations and lab tests and assessed their vision against a letter chart while a medic clicked the diagnostic lenses into focus.

Those attending the rodeo included lieutenant colonels and above. “These are all senior leaders that are getting ready to take command. They come to the university for only a year, so we try to take care of all their medical readiness on the front end, since their schedules are so busy,” Henderson said.

U.S. Army Sgt.1st Class Marisela Laracuente, the noncommissioned officer in charge of the readiness rodeo, said medics treating leaders is mutually beneficial.

“For the medics it gives them more confidence working with senior officers, and it also helps leaders coming through the rodeos to trust in their medics,” she said. “Since we will be their first line of care downrange, it goes both ways and builds confidence on both sides.”

Screening to stay healthy and ready

While many came seeking care for known issues, the event also uncovered health needs through screenings. Record reviewers flagged abnormal test findings during the rodeo and sent results to providers down the line. Chowdhury described why these preventive screenings are vital to staying fit for the fight: “Maybe they’re over 45 and they needed to get a colonoscopy but forgot to schedule one. This would become apparent during the periodic health assessment. That’s why we hammer in readiness.”

At the core of the health readiness rodeo, Chowdhury said, is for all to stay ready for the mission. “We hold events like this so we can carry on with the mission—winning America’s wars.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9241365/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-21 13:56:20.585491

“Providers that participate in federally funded health care programs must abide by the rules and submit proper claims for care that was in fact rendered.
One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.","August 20, 2025 – SAN FRANCISCO, CA – American Psychiatric Centers, Inc., doing business under the name Comprehensive Psychiatric Services (CPS), has agreed to pay $2.75 million to resolve allegations that CPS violated the False Claims Act by submitting false claims to government healthcare payors for certain psychotherapy services.

CPS, which is headquartered in Walnut Creek, Calif., provides behavioral medicine services for individuals and families in the State of California. Since at least 2015, CPS and its healthcare providers have submitted claims to government payors using Current Procedural Terminology codes 90833 and 90836, which are “add-on” codes to be used when psychotherapy services are performed in conjunction with an evaluation and management visit, and which require specific documentation.

The settlement announced today resolves the government’s allegations that, from Jan. 1, 2015, through Dec. 31, 2022, CPS submitted fraudulent claims using these add-on codes in instances where its healthcare providers either had not provided the services described by those codes or had failed to sufficiently document that such services had been provided. CPS will pay $2,615,569.32 to the United States and $134,430.68 to the State of California.

“Providers that participate in federally funded health care programs must abide by the rules and submit proper claims for care that was in fact rendered. To do otherwise is to drain resources from our fellow Americans who rely on Medicare and other government programs. This settlement sends a clear message that we will continue to investigate and pursue any entity that fraudulently seeks to increase profits at taxpayers’ expense,” said United States Attorney Craig H. Missakian.

“Holding health care providers accountable for submitting false claims to Federal health care programs is crucial for ensuring that taxpayer funds are appropriately used and for maintaining the American public’s trust,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey McIntosh of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “Working closely with our law enforcement partners, our agency remains dedicated to protecting taxpayer-funded programs that deliver essential behavioral health services.”

“Today’s outcome concludes a collaborative effort to hold Comprehensive Psychiatric Services accountable for its improper billing practices. These actions undermined our Federal health care system, including the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program,” said John E. Helsing, Acting Special Agent in Charge for the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Western Field Office. “DCIS will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to investigate health care providers that seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the American taxpayer.”

“Veterans and their families expect and deserve the highest quality healthcare delivered in a safe and accountable setting,” said Special Agent in Charge Dimitriana Nikolov with the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General’s Northwest Field Office. “This settlement is a testament to the VA OIG’s commitment to safeguarding the integrity of VA’s healthcare programs and preserving taxpayer funds.”

“False claims increase costs and undermine the integrity of our federal health care programs, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program,” said Derek M. Holt, Special Agent in Charge, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General (OPM OIG). “We support the work of our law enforcement partners and colleagues to investigate fraudulent medical billing that wastes taxpayer dollars.”

Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelsey Helland handled this matter for the government, with the assistance of Garland He. The investigation and settlement resulted from a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, HHS-OIG, DCIS, VA OIG, OPM OIG, and the California Department of Justice, Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse.

The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement can be reported to HHS at 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.

My doctor's in the US had given me a 6-month stock of all the medication I was on so that I would have enough time to find a new doctor and get everything situated. I was on Tricare select and trying to get command sponsored for a long time. It literally took 6 months for them (efmp? If forgot the name) to even look at the paperwork. It wasn't until my husband got his first sergeant involved that they actually started doing anything.

My husband has never PCS'd before and I was really sick for the first four months of being here, and spent a lot of time in and out of the ER, so that definitely slowed down the process with him not having any clue what to do and taking care of me.

But now I just did the initial doctor's appointment to get command sponsored, and she gave me a bunch of referrals. I thought that meant my sponsorship went through, but they're not answering again and it's been two weeks. I called and tried to make doctor's appointments for base providers and was told that all of the referrals had been closed and that their understaffed anyway so I'll just have to find someone off post. Even with select I've been trying to find providers off post and have no clue how. The ones that I found never respond Even after I've sent them intake paperwork and tried to make an appointment. I ran out of medication (thyroid issues) 4 months ago and have just been treating it myself with a range of supplements.

Also, at the initial doctor's appointment for command sponsorship (I honest to God cannot remember what it's called, I'm sorry, I'm freaking out), I told her that I had PCOS/thyroid issues that I've been trying to get treated since 17 (My parents thought religious blessings should be used for everything unless you're actively dying, and then you can go to the hospital... Also there's just a lot of medical incompetence and I've had some unethical doctors, so never really able to get any treatment and I'm 26 now). The doctor sent out for labs and I asked for her to give me a referral to endocrinology and she said we would just wait to see if I actually had it. They called me two days later and informed me that I actually did have dangerously high insulin levels and I said no shit, that's what I told you. But they said that they wouldn't be able to give me a referral to endocrinology or anything until I was sponsored and until my doctor signed off on it which could be weeks.

I'm really confused right now, and I feel really alone here. Basically all the important information I've been able to find has been from other spouses on base. I was so relieved to be able to have insurance that wasn't controlled by my parents / the shitty situation I was in before, and now I'm just really confused and I'm so tired of doing absolutely everything I can with my health/lifestyle to maintain my health and still be told that I need to try harder to lose weight or informed that I have something that I already told them I had. I don't want to keep going around in loops, especially being in a foreign country in a system that I don't understand and not knowing where to go for help.

Sorry, word vomiting, but I've been here for almost a year now and I don't know what to do or if this is normal or really what anyone was saying. They didn't really want to explain it or stay on the phone with me, they just kept passing me around to different offices that were annoyed I was asking questions",,N,0.0,2025-08-21 01:56:19.855327

What You Need to Know: DHCS is rolling out a series of Medi-Cal Rx policy changes starting November 1, 2025, with more extensive coverage restrictions set to take effect January 1, 2026. The changes aim to curb pharmacy spending and improve program integrity but may affect access to preventive and over-the-counter treatments.

The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) has released a notice of upcoming changes to Medi-Cal Rx as part of the 2025-26 state budget. The new rules will be phased in over the coming months, beginning with an update to the coordination of benefits (COB) claims process for Medicare members on November 1, 2025.

Effective November 1, DHCS will adjust how pharmacy claims involving both Medi-Cal and Medicare (known as dual eligible) are submitted and adjudicated to streamline processing. Under the updated rules, pharmacies must submit COB claims with specific NCPDP field codes to ensure Medi-Cal Rx receives the correct payment status and addresses eligibility and payer accuracy

Additional changes effective January 1, 2026, include:

COVID‑19 Tests: Over-the-counter COVID‑19 antigen tests will require prior authorization (PA) for all Medi-Cal members.

Weight Loss Drugs: Medications used solely for weight loss or related indications will be removed from Medi-Cal Rx coverage, with patients likely having to pay out of pocket.

Revisions to OTC coverage for Adults (21+): Reimbursement policies will change for certain OTC products, including prenatal vitamins, multivitamin combinations, single-ingredient vitamins, first- and second-generation antihistamines, and dry eye treatments.

Continuation of Care Exceptions Removed: Claims receiving coverage under previous continuation of care exceptions (e.g., for drugs listed on the Medi-Cal Rx Contract Drugs List) will no longer be accepted.

Therapeutic Alternatives Required: Use of certain non-covered drugs will now require prescribing therapeutically equivalent alternatives listed in the Medi-Cal Rx Contract Drugs List before reimbursement is possible.

Recovery from these injuries is multifaceted, requiring medical care, modified activity, rest, and an element that is often overlooked—nutrition.

According to Defense Health Agency–Public Health, more than 95% of active duty military personnel’s injuries are musculoskeletal and are the leading reason for military medical visits.

The most common type of musculoskeletal injury found in military health care records is cumulative microtrauma injury, often referred to as overuse injuries, said U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, the Injury Prevention branch chief at DHA-PH. “It is important for service members to allow injuries to heal completely before returning to duty,” said Lopez. “If an injury is not healed properly, there is an increased risk for another injury. Prior injury is one of strongest predictors for future injury.”

Developing an intentional recovery plan is a key step to returning to full duty. “Service members need to modify their activities and follow an intentional recovery plan prior to returning to their full duties,” said Lopez.

An important element of the recovery plan is nutritional intervention, said Jennifer Meeks, DHA-PH nutritionist. “Nutritional interventions will help the injury recovery process by supporting optimal healing,” said Meeks. “The faster a service member or athlete recovers from injury, the quicker they can return to duty or the training field. Optimal nutrition should be the focus to get back to preinjury performance after a musculoskeletal injury.”

Proactive nutrition before an injury focuses on performance nutrition, disease prevention, and immune system enhancement, said Meeks. Reactive nutrition is specific to medical nutrition therapy after injury to control inflammation, rebuild injured tissue, minimize muscle loss, and prevent unwanted weight gain. “Even if your preinjury eating habits weren’t perfect, a focus on making more healthful choices during your recovery can have tremendous benefits,” said Meeks.

Here are some tips to consider.

1. Energy needs during recovery: During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you're not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2. Protein: The cornerstone of healing: There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you're injured, it's recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It's best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

Add legumes to your meals: Whether it's a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It's also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3. Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal: Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It's a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4. Fats: friend, not foe: While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5. Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated: While you’re recovering from an injury, it's best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6. Supplements: use with caution: Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn't just about rest and rehab—it's also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you're recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

Over the years, acquisitions such as Health Net, WellCare and Magellan Health have expanded Centene’s reach and diversified its service portfolio, providing a strong platform for long-term growth.

The company’s Marketplace segment has been a key growth driver, with membership rising 12.4% as of Dec. 31, 2024. However, profitability has come under pressure. A spike in the second-quarter health benefits ratio (HBR) forced management to sharply lower its 2025 earnings guidance to about $1.75 per share, down from the earlier projection of more than $7.00. Results were further weighed down by lower-than-anticipated 2025 risk adjustment transfers and elevated medical utilization, particularly within Medicaid and MA. Enrollment losses in these higher-margin businesses have added to the strain.

Centene’s balance sheet also reflects the costs of its acquisition-led expansion, with long-term debt of $17.6 billion as of June 30, 2025.

Looking ahead, management is focused on recovery. The company intends to reprice its Marketplace plans in 2026 to restore margins, while pursuing disciplined pricing and operational improvements to stabilize MA. These initiatives are expected to drive meaningful progress, with management targeting breakeven in MA by 2027. Despite near-term challenges, Centene’s scale and diversified operations leave it well-positioned to regain profitability and sustain growth in a competitive healthcare landscape.

The Case for Humana

Humana stands as one of the strongest players in the U.S. healthcare insurance sector, with a dominant position in MA, holding nearly 21% market share. The company continues to benefit from favorable demographics, as an aging population sustains steady demand for MA plans. As of June 30, 2025, Humana reported approximately 3.54 million MA members, with continued expansion in both Medicare Advantage and state-based programs driving premium growth.

Diversification beyond traditional insurance remains central to Humana’s strategy. Its CenterWell business—which delivers value-based primary care, pharmacy services, and home health solutions—has gained meaningful traction, enhancing long-term growth visibility and reducing dependence on insurance margins. The company is also leveraging AI-driven efficiencies, disciplined cost management and conservative guidance to strengthen operating performance and restore investor confidence.

Strategic acquisitions have further bolstered Humana’s footprint. Deals for Family Physicians Group, Your Home Advantage and Curo extended its presence in primary care and home health. The acquisition of Enclara built scale in hospice pharmacy, while iCare and Inclusa expanded Medicare and Medicaid offerings in Wisconsin. At the same time, Humana has sharpened its portfolio by divesting non-core assets, most notably by selling a 60% stake in Kindred at Home’s Hospice and Personal Care units to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, while retaining a 40% interest to benefit from the standalone company’s long-term growth.

Supported by stabilizing medical cost trends and stronger-than-expected MA retention, Humana raised its 2025 EPS outlook to about $17 and revenues above $128 billion .

Estimates for CNC and HUM

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNC’s 2025 revenues implies a year-over-year increase of 16.9% while that for EPS implies a 77% decline. EPS estimates have moved 14.6% southward over the past seven days.

On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUM’s 2025 revenues and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 9.3% and 4.8%, respectively. EPS estimates have moved 0.4% north over the past seven days.

Are CNC and HUM Shares Expensive?

Centene is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 11.61, above its median of 11.18 over the last five years. Humana’s price-to-earnings multiple sits at 19.73, above its median of 17.72 over the last five years.

Conclusion

Centene is expected to face notable headwinds under OBBBA, including reduced membership, tightening profit margins and rising operational costs. The company’s Medicaid business is already strained by increasing expenditures related to behavioral health, home-based care and costly medications.

Humana’s Medicaid business stands to benefit from several contract wins and renewals, which contribute to top-line growth. Despite witnessing strong, consistent performance in its Medicare business in recent quarters, the unit came under stress. With Humana deciding to exit certain unprofitable plans and counties, its individual MA membership might take a hit. Nonetheless, its growing focus on Florida is a major positive.

On the basis of return on equity (“ROE”), which reflects a company’s efficiency in generating profit from shareholders' equity as well as gives a clear picture of the company's financial health, HUM, with a ROE of 16.7%, scores higher than CNC, which has a ROE of 9.6%.

Moreover, shares of HUM have gained 13% year to date, in contrast to the industry and CNC’s decline of 31.6% and 51.8%, respectively, over the same time.

HUM, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an edge over CNC, which carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

As National Guard and Reserve members near age 60, they reach important milestones in their military retirement pay and benefits. Whether they have been retired awaiting pay or continue drilling until age 60, this transition requires action so benefits begin on time.

Here are four considerations for reserve component members as they approach their 60th birthday.

TRICARE Health Benefits

At 60 years old, reserve component retirees and their eligible family members can start using TRICARE for health and medical needs — the same version as their retired active duty counterparts.

Some reserve component members might have been using TRICARE Reserve Select or Retired Reserve, both of which require premiums. Upon turning 60, retirees become eligible for standard TRICARE plans with much less expensive enrollment fees. Importantly, enrollment fees count toward a family’s catastrophic cap, which further reduces overall health care costs.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Your location can impact the availability of plans, which might include TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Overseas, and the US Family Health Plan.

Reserve component retirees must contact TRICARE within 90 days of turning 60; otherwise, they will need to wait until another qualifying life event or an annual open season to enroll.

Military Retirement Pay

Reserve component members might have retired from active drilling status before this point, but age 60 typically marks the beginning of their retirement pay. Some members might be eligible to start earlier if they completed qualifying periods of active duty. However, no member can receive retirement pay before age 50.

To qualify for military retirement pay, members must have completed at least 20 “good” years of service, as confirmed by their notice of eligibility. Retirement pay does not begin automatically, so retirees must apply in advance. It’s recommended they submit DD forms 108 and 2656 six to nine months before turning 60. Each branch of the reserve component has its own process for submitting retirement pay applications.

Survivor Benefit Plan

Depending on the election made when they received their notice of eligibility, retirees might need to make a decision about the military’s Survivor Benefit Plan. This program provides financial security for a spouse or designated beneficiaries after the retiree’s death by continuing a portion of the retirement pay.

If a retiree opts out of the plan or selects reduced coverage, spousal consent is required. This ensures both parties are aware of the potential financial impact of not enrolling in full coverage.

Retiree ID Card

Reserve component retirees should update military identification cards for themselves and their family members. This will provide continued access to base facilities, such as commissaries. It will also indicate TRICARE medical coverage.",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/8426212352524455a00b694729289801/older-couple-hopeful-h.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-20 19:56:20.549829

Completely out of network/not Tricare authorized (meaning not in the Tricare system at all), you won't be able to get any reimbursement.

You can try to put in an authorization for a non network provider and make sure to explain that all in network providers are booked up. Hopefully they will approve it. I know they do this if you can’t find a network provider less than 1hr from you.

When I was pregnant last year I could not find an OB or get appointments. I had to keep calling to get my referral switched probably 5 times and finally I found one but before I found one they told me they can request an out of network provider since all the others were booked out and not accepting. Not sure if it’s the same but it seemed like that was going to be my next step/that it was possible.
