In total, his scheme involved $118 million in false claims, defrauding $28 million from insurance companies.

Videos by Suggest

According to a press release issued by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Public Affairs, Zamora-Quezada was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, seven counts of healthcare fraud, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Zamora-Quezada managed to defraud a multitude of insurance companies by falsely diagnosing his patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These include Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

He would administer “toxic medications” and make his patients believe they had the disease, which lasts for life and is incurable. That way, his patients were treated continuously at his offices.

To further expand his fraudulent scheme, Zamora-Quezada fabricated medical records. That way, he could effectively lie to his patients’ insurers by claiming they were sick with the aforementioned disease. As previously stated, he managed to secure $118 million in false claims and defrauded $28 million from insurance companies.

‘Unnecessary Treatments’

Following his faux diagnoses, Zamora-Quezada administered “unnecessary treatments” and even ordered equally unnecessary testing. These tests, which included x-rays, MRIs, infusions, and injections, can be fatal due to their potential side effects.

The effects of his reckless and illegal behavior were made evident. Some of his patients suffered serious side effects. These include, but are not limited to, strokes, jawbone necrosis, and liver damage.

“Constantly being in bed and being unable to get up from bed alone, and being pumped with medication, I didn’t feel like my life had any meaning,” one patient testified in court.

Furthermore, Zamora-Quezada also intimidated and manipulated his employees, referring to himself as “eminencia,” or “eminence” in English. He would intentionally hire employees on J-1 visas to have further control over them, threatening their legal status.

“Dr. Zamora-Quezada funded his luxurious lifestyle for two decades by traumatizing his patients, abusing his employees, lying to insurers, and stealing taxpayer money,” Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said. “His depraved conduct represents a profound betrayal of trust toward vulnerable patients who depend on care and integrity from their doctors.”",https://www.suggest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jorge-Zamora-Quezada.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-25 19:56:19.838197

Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.","Readers,

Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.

Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.

We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.

We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.

One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.

Help us save her.

A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.

Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.

Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.

We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.

Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.

In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and lightning fast website you deserve.

Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.

We can save America together.

I have both and use VA almost exclusively as they take care of me far more thoroughly than private practices. I use tricare only for things that need to happen within weeks.

Ultimately its your decision based off your circumstances but myth of ""If I go to VA they will take my rating"" needs to die.

I am 100% PT left in 2005 have always used VA. No issues but I know many people who can’t find Tricare providers.. I don’t accept it myself at my practice as it pays less than I pay my clinicians.. but I see almost anyone I want with the VA. I often get sent to community care when requesting a specific clinician based upon my medical needs

VA medical is through the VHA. Our ratings come from the VBA. There is no automatic reporting from one to the other. Ratings get changed due to audits (due to mistakes/errors) or because someone files for an increase and they determine that a change (either increase or decrease is necessary). Going to the VA for medical won’t get you reduced.

I thought the same thing. I was never gonna go to the VA after I got my 100%. But, the VA near me is very good and has a lot of availability, plus getting meds shipped to home is a big plus for me. I've also seen my primary care thru Tricare and it was just as seamless. Whenever I need an issue addressed I just see whichever one has availability first and go there. So far so good no issues with ratings. Many posts on this forum about how the VHA and VBA do not talk to eachother.",,N,0.0,2025-05-25 01:56:24.129747

The 3 times a week is a lot of times to keep people healing because they don’t do the exercises at home.

I'm going to be no real help here. Yes, the $51 copay is ridiculous. I surprised your spouse gets a lesser copay on Retired Select. Mine does not. I spent a lot of time in PT last year and my husband between late last year and now this year.

I'm not sure why Tricare buckets PT visits within the ""specialist"" fee. It should not be. At a minimum, it should be the rate you'd pay for a routine GP visit.

Unfortunately, it is our Congress that sets the terms of Tricare and I've often though I needed to write a letter to my representative about this but then I forget. Your post has reminded me, and you should do the same. It won't fix things today, but maybe down the road.

That said, the other poster had a good idea of trying out an out-of-network provider. My costs always seem lower when I go that route, though I haven't tried it for PT becuase they all seem to be providers in my area.

Once retired, the costs are the same, so you don't cost more than your spouse. Are either of you employed with a company that has a healthcare FSA? I fund mine and the full amount is available January 1, but the money is taken from my paychecks throughout the year, so it ends up being a tax free /interest free loan. Sounds like you will hit the catastrophic max each year, so know that will be a relief at some point.

What to Expect from Virtual Addiction Treatment Virtual addiction treatment at Sober First Recovery offers the same level of clinical care and structure as our in-person services.
Our admissions team will guide you through the process, verify your insurance coverage, and help you decide whether virtual treatment is the right fit.","Access to effective addiction treatment should never be limited by location or daily obligations. At Sober First Recovery, we offer virtual care designed specifically for veterans, recognizing that life doesn’t pause for recovery. Using secure telehealth platforms, veterans can connect with therapists, join group sessions, and access essential recovery tools from the comfort and privacy of home. This model helps remove common obstacles such as long travel distances, lack of local providers, and demanding personal schedules while making room for consistent, accessible support that fits into real life.

What Is Virtual Addiction Treatment?

Virtual addiction treatment, sometimes referred to as online rehab or telehealth, uses video conferencing technology to deliver therapy and counseling services remotely. Sober First Recovery provides a full spectrum of care online, including intensive outpatient programming (IOP), mental health support, individual counseling, group therapy, and family support. All services are facilitated by licensed clinicians who are experienced in working with military populations and understand the unique issues veterans often carry into recovery.

Whether you’re newly sober or continuing care after inpatient treatment, our online programs deliver structure and accountability without requiring you to step into a facility.

Built for Veterans, Wherever They Are

Veterans face unique mental health and substance use challenges. PTSD, depression, chronic pain, and isolation can all contribute to a cycle of alcohol or drug misuse. But accessing the right kind of help isn’t always easy. VA waitlists can be long. Local resources may be scarce. And not every therapist truly understands the psychological weight of military service.

That’s where our virtual program makes a difference. Every aspect is created with veterans in mind. From the group topics we explore to our clinical techniques, the care is relevant, respectful, and grounded in an understanding of military life.

What to Expect from Virtual Addiction Treatment

Virtual addiction treatment at Sober First Recovery offers the same level of clinical care and structure as our in-person services. The main difference is that you log in from your home instead of driving to a facility.

Here’s what our online program includes:

Intensive Outpatient Programming (IOP)

Our virtual IOP runs three to five days per week and provides a blend of individual therapy, group counseling, and mental health services. Sessions are scheduled to work around your job, caregiving, or time zone, making it easier to stick with treatment. The program is ideal for veterans who need consistent support but also want to maintain their responsibilities at home or work.

Individual Therapy

These one-on-one sessions focus on the specific factors fueling your substance use. Whether it’s combat trauma, moral injury, grief, or unresolved family issues, your therapist will work with you to identify patterns and develop healthier ways to cope. These conversations are private and centered on helping you move forward at a pace that works for you.

Group Therapy

Group sessions offer a chance to connect with other veterans who’ve walked similar paths. Topics often include post-traumatic stress, anxiety, guilt, reintegration after service, and relapse prevention. The shared experience creates a sense of solidarity that many veterans say is hard to find elsewhere.

Family Counseling

Substance use affects more than just the person struggling—it ripples through families and relationships. Our virtual program includes optional family sessions to help rebuild trust, open up communication, and address the impact of addiction on loved ones.

Privacy and Security

We use secure, HIPAA-compliant video conferencing tools that protect your health information and provide a safe, private space to engage in therapy. All you need is a device with a camera and internet access. Our support team will walk you through the setup and answer any tech questions you may have.

Who Benefits from Virtual Care?

While anyone seeking recovery can benefit from online treatment, there are certain circumstances where virtual care is especially helpful:

Living in a rural or remote location without easy access to in-person services

Juggling work or family obligations that make it difficult to attend scheduled on-site sessions

Recovering from physical injuries or disabilities that limit mobility

Feeling more comfortable receiving care in a familiar environment

Needing continued support for addiction recovery or mental health after completing residential or partial hospitalization treatment

Veterans who prefer more privacy or who are hesitant about group settings often find that virtual care offers a less intimidating way to begin the recovery process. It’s also a good fit for those who value structure but need more control over their schedule.

A Clinical Approach to Military-Focused Care

Sober First Recovery’s virtual care team includes licensed professionals who bring experience in trauma-informed treatment and military cultural competence. They know that healing from addiction often means addressing the invisible wounds of service—memories that don’t fade, habits that were once survival tools but no longer serve you, and the internal battles that follow even after discharge.

Our clinicians aren’t just generalists applying standard techniques. They are trained to help veterans process trauma, regulate emotions, and build resilience using therapeutic models that include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), EMDR, and others.

A Bridge Between VA Services and Civilian Care

We understand that many veterans have already engaged with VA healthcare or received VA benefits. Our virtual program can complement your VA services or act as a bridge if you’re on a waitlist or looking for more immediate care.

When appropriate and with your consent, our team can coordinate with your primary care providers or VA caseworkers to share treatment progress, avoid gaps in support, and contribute to a broader picture of your health and recovery.

Healing Without Barriers

One of the biggest advantages of virtual addiction and mental health treatment is the ability to stay engaged in recovery without putting your life on hold. You don’t have to quit your job, arrange childcare, or relocate to attend a facility. You don’t even need to leave your living room.

This accessibility matters. Because addiction doesn’t wait for the “perfect” time to get better, it doesn’t accommodate your calendar. But with the right support system in place, you can start making progress today—even if your circumstances are less than ideal.

Getting Started Is Easy

We know reaching out for help is hard. It requires honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to imagine something different. But we’ve made the rest as simple as possible.

All it takes is a phone call or online inquiry to get started. Our admissions team will guide you through the process, verify your insurance coverage, and help you decide whether virtual treatment is the right fit. There’s no pressure, judgment, or hoops to jump through.

Once enrolled, we’ll set you up with the necessary links, provide a short orientation, and match you with a care team that will support you every step of the way.

TRICARE spends over $100,000 per patient on spinal fusion surgery but makes rehab harder to access.

Opioid prescriptions cost TRICARE millions annually, even though early rehab reduces opioid use by 60% in chronic pain cases.

Fox News reported that Amanda Johnson, the spouse of a U.S. Marine and mother of five children, has claimed that her family has been denied an upcoming move to Peru due to her children not being fully vaccinated. The outlet noted that the Navy’s official policy does not require military families to have their children receive all recommended vaccines.

In a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote, “We are 30 days out from our overseas move & the Navy hasn’t cleared my children because they aren’t following the ACIP jab schedule. We are in limbo and have been waiting for months for a determination.”

“The Navy is saying because our children do not follow the CDC/ACIP schedule (the c0vid-19 shot is on here as well), our children are not medically suitable,” Johnson added. “And if we want to keep our family together, they must get *every* shot on the schedule.”

A picture of Johnson’s post, which features her family, has been shared on X, formerly Twitter.

Johnson told Fox News that the family was informed their children were “not suitable solely based on their vaccination status.”

The Navy’s BUMEDINST 1300.2B policy states, “Family members are not required to be immunized.” Additionally, Fox News reported that TRICARE, the U.S. military’s health care program, notes that an individual’s vaccination status “is not reviewed as part of the TRICARE overseas enrollment screening process.”

“We’re not breaking any rules,” Johnson told Fox News. “Peru doesn’t require vaccines, and Navy policy doesn’t either. We’ve done everything right, but, still, we’re stuck.”

Fox News reported that Amanda Johnson’s husband, Marine Capt. Hunter Johnson, sent a letter to Navy Medical Jacksonville regarding the family’s medical plan.

“Our children have not been, and will not be, enrolled in childcare. My wife is fully devoted to their daily care,” the Marine captain wrote in a letter to the Navy. “We homeschool using Time4Learning and limit exposure to institutional illness risks.

“Peru has no vaccination requirements… My continued presence is essential to our family’s stability,” Johnson added. “This is not a deployment, it’s a PCS [permanent change of station].”

According to Fox News, the Johnson family has already made preparations for housing in Peru and secured an Airbnb location near the Los Angeles International Airport ahead of their expected flight to Peru.

“They told us, ‘You can push out your orders,’ but that’s absolutely not an option,” Johnson said. “We’re not going to be punished because Navy can’t get it together.”",https://americanmilitarynews.com/wp-content/uploads/US-NEWS-HEALTH-VACCINES-EXEMPTIONS-DMT-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-23 16:56:20.188936

Our Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) offers veterans the opportunity for intensive, structured care without requiring overnight stays. It is an important step between inpatient and outpatient therapy, offering daily assistance as veterans establish stability and confidence to progress. With clinical treatment, veteran peer support, and trauma-informed therapy, we create an environment where healing can actually happen.

What is a Partial Hospitalization Program for Veterans?

A Partial Hospitalization Program is a structured outpatient treatment model that combines the rigor of inpatient care with the freedom of living off-site. Veterans attend full-day therapy sessions, skill-building groups, and supportive activities, then return to their homes or sober living environments in the evening.

For many, PHP offers the ideal balance: the security of daily therapeutic engagement without the restrictions of inpatient living. It is especially valuable for those stepping down from detox or residential programs, as well as for veterans whose symptoms are too intense for weekly outpatient therapy alone.

At Sober First Recovery, our PHP for veterans is built with a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by those who have served. From PTSD and depression to anxiety and substance use disorders, our approach is sensitive, purposeful, and rooted in real-world understanding of the military experience.

What Veterans Can Expect in Our PHP

A Structured Daily Routine for Recovery

Consistency is a powerful tool in the recovery process. Our PHP provides a predictable, supportive schedule five days a week, creating a sense of normalcy that helps veterans regain confidence. Each day typically includes individual therapy, group sessions, educational workshops, and time for skill development—all focused on emotional, psychological, and social healing.

By maintaining a steady rhythm, veterans are able to rebuild their internal sense of stability, which often feels disrupted after struggles with trauma or addiction.

Individualized Therapy with Veteran-Focused Clinicians

Healing is deeply personal, and every veteran deserves one-on-one attention. Veterans enrolled in our PHP work closely with licensed clinicians who specialize in both mental health and addiction recovery for military populations. Therapy sessions address core issues such as combat trauma, survivor’s guilt, grief, moral injury, and the complicated emotional aftermath of military service.

The aim is not just symptom reduction but genuine, meaningful progress that empowers each veteran to move forward.

Group Therapy Centered on Shared Experience

Veterans often find powerful connections with others who have lived through similar experiences. Our group therapy sessions are built around this principle. Groups explore critical topics like emotional regulation, relapse prevention, rebuilding civilian identities, and fostering healthy relationships.

Group therapy is not just about sharing; it is about understanding, challenging, and lifting each other up. Veterans find strength in the community and learn new coping skills that extend far beyond the walls of the treatment center.

Medical Oversight and Medication Management

Many veterans face co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders that require careful medical attention. Our PHP includes active involvement from medical professionals who oversee medication management and monitor physical health. By integrating medical care into daily programming, we provide a full spectrum of support that addresses both emotional and physical needs.

Family Support and Communication

Recovery does not happen in isolation. Families often play a key role in a veteran’s healing process. Our program offers family therapy options that help restore trust, rebuild communication, and foster healthier family dynamics. When families heal alongside veterans, long-term recovery becomes more sustainable.

Core Services for Veterans in Partial Hospitalization

At Sober First Recovery, veterans receive focused, veteran-specific services that extend beyond generic addiction treatment:

Trauma-Informed Care Every Step of the Way

Trauma leaves deep imprints on the mind and body. Our trauma-informed approach respects the unique realities veterans carry. Every therapy session and group meeting is conducted with sensitivity, compassion, and a recognition of the lasting effects of trauma.

Support for Dual Diagnoses

Veterans often face different mental health and substance use challenges simultaneously. Our team is skilled at addressing dual diagnoses, which is treating both issues concurrently to promote stronger outcomes and lasting stability.

Coordination with VA Benefits and Insurance

Most veterans have already spent time dealing with VA benefits, and the process is not always easy. While VA coverage can help pay for treatment, figuring it out can be confusing and frustrating. Our admissions team steps in to help sort through the paperwork, answer questions, and make sure veterans are not stuck waiting for the care they need. We keep it simple so the focus stays on getting better.

Personalized Discharge Planning

No one leaves our PHP without a solid plan for what comes next. Each veteran receives a highly detailed discharge plan that might include stepping into an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), pursuing sober living arrangements, or connecting with long-term therapy and community support resources.

Civilian Reintegration Support

Transitioning from military to civilian life can be challenging. We offer practical support to help veterans navigate employment, family reintegration, community involvement, and rebuilding purpose. Life after service can be meaningful, and we help veterans rediscover their place in the world.

Who Benefits Most from Our Partial Hospitalization Program for Veterans?

Our PHP is ideal for veterans who:

Are transitioning from detox or inpatient residential programs but still need daily therapeutic structure

Are struggling with symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, or substance use disorders that interfere with daily life

Are motivated to build coping skills and reconnect with civilian life

Need a higher level of support than traditional outpatient therapy can provide

For many veterans, reaching out for help can feel intimidating. At Sober First Recovery, vulnerability is met with understanding and respect. Veterans are not defined by their struggles—they are recognized for their strength, resilience, and potential.

Seamless Transitions Into and Beyond PHP

Recovery is a continuum, not a one-time event. We make sure that transitions into and out of PHP are smooth and supportive. For veterans moving into PHP from detox or residential care, we offer structured admission processes that maintain momentum and reduce anxiety.

When the time comes to graduate from PHP, our team provides personalized aftercare planning that might include:

Intensive Outpatient Programming (IOP)

Individual outpatient therapy

Peer mentorship programs

Community-based support groups

Sober living homes

Employment and education assistance

No veteran leaves without a clear, personalized roadmap for continued success.

What Makes Sober First Recovery for Veteran Partial Hospitalization Different

Veterans deserve treatment centers that honor their experience, see their strengths, and recognize their unique hardships. At Sober First Recovery, we combine expert clinical care with an authentic, heart-centered approach.

We are committed to:

Listening to each veteran’s story with respect and without judgment

Providing a safe and welcoming environment that fosters real growth

“Our common-sense reforms honor the service and sacrifice military families make every day.
But for too many military families, long waiting lists put that lifeline out of reach,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association.
The bill allows military families to remain on their home state’s Medicaid throughout their military career.
The Care for Military Kids Act is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), the National Military Families Organization, and Blue Star Families.","[WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Jen Kiggans (R-VA) this week introduced a bipartisan, bicameral legislative package that aims to improve services and benefits for military families. Included in the package is the Care for Military Kids Act – which is co-led by U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) – the Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act, the Coast Guard Parity Act, and the Bonus Act, all of which make meaningful reforms to improve health, personal, and financial outcomes for servicemembers and their families.

“Our bipartisan, bicameral legislative package will make a real difference in servicemembers’ lives—expanding benefits and improving healthcare for their loved ones,” said Blumenthal. “Our common-sense reforms honor the service and sacrifice military families make every day. By easing the financial burden on families and ensuring access to critical healthcare coverage, our measures will improve the quality of life for thousands of military families.”

“As a Navy spouse and mom of four, I know the extraordinary sacrifices our military families make to keep our nation safe—and they deserve more than just words of appreciation,” said Kiggans. “That’s why I’ve worked across the Capitol to advance commonsense legislation that improves healthcare access, protects earned benefits, and provides greater financial security for our servicemembers. Whether it’s ensuring National Guard members are able to choose the healthcare that works best for them and their families, fixing gaps in Medicaid coverage when families move between states, or making sure Coast Guardsmen can finish their careers with dignity, these bills are about honoring service with real, meaningful support.”

“Military families make immense sacrifices for our nation, and ensuring their children have consistent access to critical healthcare should never be a burden placed on them,” said Tillis. “This bipartisan legislation will allow these families to maintain their home state's Medicaid benefits, giving our servicemembers the peace of mind they deserve.”

“Medicaid can be a lifeline for military families whose family members need services that TRICARE doesn’t cover. But for too many military families, long waiting lists put that lifeline out of reach,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association. “The Care for Military Kids Act would ensure that military families can maintain vital Medicaid services regardless of where they are stationed. We thank Senator Blumenthal and Representative Kiggans for leading the way on this important legislation.”

“For Guardsmen, juggling military requirements along with family, civilian careers, and education can be daunting. These bills are excellent steps forward to ease some of those stressors,” said retired Maj Gen. Francis M. McGinn, NGAUS president. “These policies address real issues that military families face on a personal, health, and financial level. I commend Senator Blumenthal and Congresswoman Kiggans for recognizing the unique nuances and for addressing them with continued dedication.”

The Care for Military Kids Act ensures servicemembers can maintain critical healthcare coverage and medical services for their children no matter where their service takes them. After moving to another state, current Medicaid regulations force military families to reapply for their children’s long-term care benefits through Medicaid since Tricare does not provide that benefit. The bill allows military families to remain on their home state’s Medicaid throughout their military career. The Care for Military Kids Act is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), the National Military Families Organization, and Blue Star Families. Bill text is available here.

The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act allows members of the Selected Reserve and National Guard holding employment within the federal government the choice between military and civilian healthcare plans. Current federal law prohibits members of the Reserves and Guard who are Federal employees – and eligible for Federal Health Benefits – from participating in the DOD’s Tricare system. The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act is endorsed by NGAUS, the Reserve Organization of America (ROA), and the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA). Bill text is available here.

The Bonus Act would make all military recruitment and retention bonuses tax-free. Currently, military bonuses are taxed at the same level as those in the private sector. As a method to improve recruitment and retention, this legislation would eliminate the tax penalty on every eligible bonus. Bill text is available here.

The Coast Guard Parity Act ensures that enlisted Coast Guardsmen with at least 18 but fewer than 20 years of service are retained until they reach 20 years, unless separated for cause or misconduct. All other branches of the Armed Forces provide this protection. Bill text is available here.

Here’s what you need to know about TRICARE health plan options for young adults.

“As your child reaches important milestones like graduation or specific birthdays, they may face changes to their TRICARE health plan eligibility,” explained Debra Fisher, health system specialist, Policy & Programs Branch, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Understanding these options early helps ensure your adult child can make well-informed decisions about their future health care coverage.”

Coverage before age 21 and during college

Young adults can keep their current TRICARE plan until at least age 21. College students may use their existing plan until they turn 23 or graduate, whichever happens first, as described in the TRICARE Young Adult Program Fact Sheet.

To qualify, they must:

Be a full-time student at an approved institution of higher education

Have a TRICARE sponsor who provides more than 50% of their financial support

If your child attends college, they’ll need to update their student status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Additionally, if your child moves away for college, they’ll need to update their address in DEERS. This is especially important if they move to a different TRICARE region or outside a Prime Service Area.

TRICARE Young Adult

TRICARE Young Adult offers health coverage for children who lose TRICARE eligibility due to age. To qualify, they must:

Be an unmarried child of an eligible service member

Be at least 21 but not yet 26 years old

Not qualify for employer-sponsored health plans

Not be eligible for other TRICARE plans

TYA comes in two options: TYA-Prime and TYA-Select. Which one your child can choose depends on their sponsor’s status and where they live.

TYA has monthly premiums. After premiums, other out-of-pocket costs depend on which option your child chooses, their sponsor’s status, and where they get care.

TYA-Prime

With TYA-Prime, your child will:

Mainly get care from military hospitals and clinics

Need referrals for specialty care

Have lower out-of-pocket costs

TYA-Select

With TYA-Select, your child will:

Choose any TRICARE-authorized provider

Not need referrals for most care

Pay higher out-of-pocket costs than with TYA-Prime

Both TYA options include medical and pharmacy benefits, plus routine eye exams. Neither includes full vision or dental coverage, which can be purchased separately.

When TYA coverage ends

Your child’s TYA coverage will end when any of the following occur:

They turn 26

They get married

They become eligible for an employer-sponsored health plan

They qualify for other TRICARE coverage

They choose to end coverage

If your child ends TYA coverage voluntarily, they can’t purchase it again for 12 months. This lockout doesn’t apply if they gain access to an employer plan or other TRICARE coverage.

Continued Health Care Benefit Program

If your child loses TRICARE eligibility, they may qualify for the Continued Health Care Benefit Program. This premium-based plan offers the same coverage as TRICARE Select for up to 36 months, serving as a bridge to civilian health insurance.

To enroll in CHCBP, your child must apply within 60 days of losing TRICARE eligibility.

The report, “Hearing Health Surveillance Data Review-Calendar Year 2023,” includes data from DOD personnel in hearing conservation programs across all military departments.

The number of all service members with hearing loss decreased slightly to 12.0% in 2023 compared to 2022, and civilians with hearing loss was 34.7% for the same period. Active duty service members had the lowest rates of hearing loss in 2023 (10.7%) compared to the National Guard (16.2%) and Reserve (15.2%).

For DOD, good hearing is essential for being fit and ready for duty. “Healthy hearing means service members can clearly hear commands or instructions, as well as hear a nearby enemy. Wearing hearing protection that is fitted to each person and their job also keeps their hearing healthy,” said Dr. Theresa Schulz, the center’s hearing loss prevention chief.

Hearing protection fits right when it:

Fits tightly inside or over your ears

Feels comfortable

Blocks out noise

Reducing Hearing Loss

According to Schulz, testing how well a hearing protector fits a person can help reduce hearing loss compared to when the protection doesn’t fit correctly.

The goal is to simplify processes and create standard rules, to make surgeries smoother and improve patient care.

The effort aims to reduce delays, improve communication among surgical teams, and make ORs more efficient. Standardizing processes will also help every patient receive a high level of care, no matter where they’re treated in the Military Health System.

Project Goals

The OR Optimization Project focuses on:

Reducing surgery delays

Improving communication with surgical teams

Standardizing care across the MHS

Solving Common Problems

The OR Optimization Project looks to improve several issues:

Staff Readiness: Standard rules lead to more efficient medical teams who are better prepared to do their jobs.

Cost Savings: Having the right number of staff in operating rooms saves money.

Performance Metrics: Using the same measures for all operating rooms makes it easier to see how they are doing.

“The OR Optimization Project benefits everyone—lower costs for taxpayers, better readiness for the force, and better outcomes for patients,” said Dr. Matthew Mayfield, DHA’s Assistant Director Health Care Administration surgical lead.

Creating Standard Rules

The DHA and surgery experts are writing rules for scheduling surgeries, deciding how many staff members are needed, and measuring how well operating rooms perform.

These rules mix the best ideas from civilian hospitals with the special needs of military surgery, Mayfield said. “The project uses civilian expertise along with military surgery knowledge to create strong, efficient processes across the Defense Health Agency,” he explained.

Training staff is also an important part of this effort. Teams will learn how to follow the new rules and use the tools provided to help them succeed.

Benefits for Patients and Providers

Patients will see fewer delays and cancellations as processes improve. For medical staff, the changes will mean clearer steps to follow, better teamwork, and less paperwork. “Our teams are dedicated to making things better and providing safe and efficient surgical care,” said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Johnson, department head of the main operating room at Naval Medical Center San Diego.

What’s Next

The OR Optimization Project is rolling out in steps so facilities can adjust gradually. Feedback from staff and patients will help improve the processes. “This teamwork is about building a better system for everyone,” said Johnson. “By working together, we’re laying the foundation for long-term success in surgical care.”

“As your child reaches important milestones like graduation or specific birthdays, they may face changes to their TRICARE health plan eligibility,” explained Debra Fisher, health system specialist, Policy & Programs Branch, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Understanding these options early helps ensure your adult child can make well-informed decisions about their future health care coverage.”

Coverage before age 21 and during college

Young adults can keep their current TRICARE plan until at least age 21. College students may use their existing plan until they turn 23 or graduate, whichever happens first, as described in the TRICARE Young Adult Program Fact Sheet.

To qualify, they must:

Have a TRICARE sponsor who provides more than 50% of their financial support

If your child attends college, they’ll need to update their student status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Additionally, if your child moves away for college, they'll need to update their address in DEERS. This is especially important if they move to a different TRICARE region or outside a Prime Service Area.

Aside from his own determination, grit, and strive for excellence, Gadson references his MHS care team for his successes.","Lying in a hospital bed days before Memorial Day in 2007, then U.S. Army Lt. Col. Gregory Gadson only heard a single thought.

“How close am I to being memorialized?”

Yet above the whirring of medical equipment around him, the beeps of his heart rate, and the sympathetic, soft voices of the doctors telling him that they had to amputate his leg to save his life—a second thought emerged:

“I’m not going to quit.”

Days earlier, Gadson had been on a routine patrol in Baghdad, Iraq. He was thrown from his vehicle after it was struck by an improvised explosive device. Gadson was in critical condition, his legs and arm severely damaged from the attack.

“All I knew how to do was push back, even in this fog and moment of uncertainty, not knowing what to expect.”

What Gadson didn’t know at the time was that his story of resilience would define his life’s work moving forward. He would remain on active duty, promoted to the rank of colonel, take command of one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and serve 26 years in the U.S. Army. In retirement, Gadson would become a motivational speaker, sharing his story of how he recovered, rebuilt, and persevered in the years following his injuries. His compelling message would inspire crowds at events and conferences even in front of thousands of military health professionals at the 2024 Military Health System Research Symposium. Gadson would highlight the importance of medical training, and how the character of the military medical experts involved in his care, were instrumental in saving his life.

He would discuss his journey with NFL teams who went onto victory, with cadets looking upon their next chapter of life, with Department of Defense staff about hiring those with disabilities. He would share his story as encouragement to carry on, to spark hope to those fighting for recovery, and to tell others to “be the best you can today … and moving forward, really embrace health,” said Gadson.

Football-Turned-War Hero

A football star in his youth, Gadson followed his dream of becoming a professional football player—all the way to U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

“That was the most important thing, in the back of my mind, to have a pro-football career,” Gadson said. “You might say I went there with a bit of a chip on my shoulder, because I wanted to prove that I could play at the highest level.”

While football and good grades may have brought him to school, it was the mindset of the military that truly became his passion.

Sports served as “a tremendous sort of development and building block. In my maturing as an athlete that, in a lot of ways, I took that into being a soldier. We have a five-year service obligation after attending the academy and I thought I would transition out and try to find my way back into football. But I fell in love with being a soldier and I just decided to keep going.”

Gadson rose through the ranks as a field artillery officer and through the guidance of “strong noncommissioned officers that I say raised me right, raised me to understand how to care, to hold us to task and to living up to standards,” that allowed him to lead soldiers.

“What kept me in was really the sense of being on a team, the sense of being part of something greater than myself, which was, ironically, very similar to being on a football team,” he said. “One of the common bonds between team sports and in our military, what we do is the sense of commitment. And I say all the time that commitment's blind it's without condition.”

As he excelled in his military career, Gadson’s West Point football teammate was also striving for success—Paul Pasquina, who was studying medicine. Their journeys would connect later in ways neither of them would have predicted.

Gadson went on to serve in Operations Desert Shield/Storm in Kuwait, Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where that one night would change his life forever.

May 7, 2007

Gadson’s battalion was returning from a memorial service in Iraq. As the patrol neared the base, it was struck by an IED.

A 19-year-old private—who had just completed a two-week medic training course—rushed to his side to treat his injuries. Before their deployment, the private had trained with his platoon, and Gadson personally had him “pulled up to be a medic because I was the senior guy in the organization. I didn’t want to break up all the teamwork that they had built for deployment.”

His senior leader intuition about the young private proved right.

“The doctors gave this young man credit for saving my life by how well he put the tourniquets on my legs,” Gadson said. “My soldiers had my life in their hands.”

After he was evacuated off the battlefield and rushed into triage, Gadson, ever the charismatic leader, found a moment of humor amid the chaos.

“They got me (triaging) in the medical clinic on the base, and they're trying to get the bleeding stopped … there’s a nurse who’s trying to get my glove off of me. I look up at him and said, ‘How are you going to save my life if you can’t get my glove off?’”

He quickly lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where Gadson would go through “129 pints of blood and go into (cardiac) arrest six times … but the doctors didn't give up on me and they kept fighting for me.”

Gadson stabilized in a combat support hospital in the Green Zone, then was flown to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, and Joint Base Andrews, and finally onto Walter Reed Army Medical Center, now part of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

A sense of familiarity came to Gadson as a member of his care team: Pasquina, now a U.S. Army colonel and doctor, recognized his former teammate.

Fate aside, his health care team had to give him the grim news about what they needed to do to save his life.

“I required surgery every other day to repair my blood vessels and clean up my wounds,” he said. “A week after arriving at Walter Reed, the doctors had to take my left leg to save my life. The blood vessels could no longer sustain blood flow, so they amputated my left leg above the knee. Ultimately, I would make the decision for them to take my right leg, because it was a not going to function as it was intended.”

He also had limited use of his right arm, learning that “my upper bicep and elbow were broken as well. That would require some surgery. And unfortunately, I had some complications from that surgery.”

Gadson also developed heterotopic ossification at the end of his legs, a condition where bone tissue forms abnormally in soft tissues outside of the skeletal system.

He said it was “one of my lowest moments because I was down to one limb. My nondominant left arm and hand was really all I had to use for all my activities of daily life. I needed someone to help me.”

Family and Seeking Support

That someone to help him was his wife. They had met as classmates at West Point, married, and had children before the attack. It was her “unconditional love” that “underwrote my recovery,” he said. “I didn't have to worry about her leaving me or my family, not wanting to be around me, wanting to shun me because I was way different. No family ever asks for this, and we certainly didn't. But she stepped up and led our family, my kids, through this.”

As Gadson adjusted to his new way of life and coped with the emotional and physical trauma of his injuries, his wife urged him to seek mental health support.

“I didn't want professional mental health, but she said, ‘We’re all going through this; you got to get some help.’”

Gadson sought his care team at Walter Reed. He started to receive mental health support for his injuries. He never lost sight of his primary goal—to continue to serve.

“I wasn't going to let myself be defined by these injuries. I was going to be defined by what I was willing to do. And so I fought to continue to stay on active duty, which ultimately was approved.”

He remained on active duty in the U.S. Army for seven years after the IED attack, eventually becoming garrison commander of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where he oversaw the daily operations for more than 140 commands and agencies for the Department of Defense. He also sought treatment from the Soldier Recovery Unit at Walter Reed—participating in unique therapies, including “elements of adaptive reconditioning,” such as riding horses, cycling, and skiing—all tailored for his healing experience.

“I thought they were absolutely brilliant because my mission was to heal,” he said. “You don't need to feel bad about being there … you need to take advantage of it because you can grow. When you struggle in life, that's when we grow.”

‘Angels’ in Recovery

When Gadson retired from the military, he realized that he had a story “people wanted to hear,” he said. As military leaders, “we have a moral obligation, a responsibility to share our life experiences. The good, the bad, the ugly. And that's strength.”

In his motivational career, he has spoken with service members in recovery, co-wrote a book, titled, “Finding Waypoints: A Warrior’s Journey Towards Peace and Purpose,” and even gave inspirational speeches to the NFL New York Giants football team, merging his passion for sports with his unprecedented story of resilience.

Aside from his own determination, grit, and strive for excellence, Gadson references his MHS care team for his successes.

“That's how I describe this network of angels in my care, everything literally was perfect, right?” Gadson said. “I'm not supposed to be here, and I'm here.”

He encourages people to think about Memorial Day as inspiration to carry on.

“My motivation is to live my best life for those who didn't make it home,” he said. “I have to make their sacrifice worth it. And the only way I make their sacrifice worth it is to make the most of my life.”

Trump DoD Nominee: “Dental health issues are often the largest cause of non-deployability within a military unit.”

“Medical readiness of Reserve and National Guard personnel is an ongoing challenge, and this could be exacerbated by the decision to remove fluoride from community drinking water.”

Text of Letter (PDF)

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), ranking member of the Personnel subcommittee for the Senate Armed Services Committee, pressed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on the harmful impact that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy’s work to remove fluoride from drinking water would have on our military readiness.

“As the Secretary of Defense, you are responsible for ensuring the readiness of American troops to maintain a capable and lethal military.” wrote Senator Warren. “Dental readiness is consistently falling short of the Military Health System (MHS) readiness goals, and will further suffer as a direct result of Secretary Kennedy’s plans.”

In 2011, the Department of Defense found that “dental decay continues to be a major problem for military personnel and is a significant reason for personnel to be classified as non-deployable.” Sean O’Keefe, the Trump administration’s nominee to be Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, recently indicated to Sen.Warren in questions for the record following his confirmation hearing that, “dental health issues are often the largest cause of non-deployability within a military unit.”

“Secretary Kennedy’s reversal of CDC’s recommendations on fluoridated water will exacerbate these readiness concerns.” wrote Senator Warren.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends community water fluoridation to prevent cavities and tooth decay. However, on April 8, 2025, Secretary Kennedy announced his plans to direct the CDC to stop recommending the fluoridation of drinking water in American communities.

In 2013, the Department of Defense mandated water fluoridation at “all [military] installations in the United States and territories that own or operate a potable water treatment facility serving 3,300 persons or more.” While this safeguard is beneficial for the military personnel that live on military installations, the majority of servicemembers live in civilian communities and would be directly affected by Secretary Kennedy’s work to undermine community water fluoridation.

Senator Warren’s letter requests information related to dental readiness and to compliance with the Department of Defense mandate to fluoridate water on military installations. In order to ensure the Department of Defense continues to prioritize military readiness, Senator Warren requested additional information from the Department by June 5, 2025.

Senator Warren has led work to improve servicemembers’ access to health care:

In December 2024, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Acting Under Secretary Vazirani raising continued concerns about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) failure to prevent price gouging and overpayments in the military’s TRICARE health program.

In June 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), U.S. Representative Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), and 20 other lawmakers sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Lester Martinez-Lopez and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, raising concerns over Express Scripts’ exclusive contract to administer TRICARE’s pharmacy program, the healthcare system for the military, retirees, and their families.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren chaired a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel. She called out the Department of Defense (DoD) for wasting billions in taxpayers dollars due to price gouging by defense contractors for services and in health care, and identified opportunities for cost savings when DoD buys personnel-related goods and services.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, regarding a series of DoD Inspector General (IG) reports finding that the Department of Defense (DoD) is failing to prevent price gouging and overpayments to contractors in the TRICARE health program.

On March 2, 2022, Senator Warren and her colleagues called out drug manufacturers for squeezing American families with rapid and widespread price hikes on prescription drugs.

In February 2022, at a hearing, Senator Warren called out corporations for abusing their market power to raise consumer prices and boost profits.

In May 2020, Senator Warren wrote to the Department requesting clarification on how the Department would prevent profiteering following a recent change to increase payments to contractors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2020, Senator Warren joined her colleagues in urging the FTC to use its full authority to prevent abusive price gouging on consumer health products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report, “Hearing Health Surveillance Data Review-Calendar Year 2023,” includes data from DOD personnel in hearing conservation programs across all military departments.

The number of all service members with hearing loss decreased slightly to 12.0% in 2023 compared to 2022, and civilians with hearing loss was 34.7% for the same period. Active duty service members had the lowest rates of hearing loss in 2023 (10.7%) compared to the National Guard (16.2%) and Reserve (15.2%).

For DOD, good hearing is essential for being fit and ready for duty.

“Healthy hearing means service members can clearly hear commands or instructions, as well as hear a nearby enemy. Wearing hearing protection that is fitted to each person and their job also keeps their hearing healthy,” said Dr. Theresa Schulz, the center’s hearing loss prevention chief.

Hearing protection fits right when it:

• Fits tightly inside or over your ears

• Feels comfortable

• Blocks out noise

Reducing Hearing Loss

According to Schulz, testing how well a hearing protector fits a person can help reduce hearing loss compared to when the protection doesn’t fit correctly.

DOD continues to work on reducing hearing loss, Schulz added. It is conducting hearing protection fit testing to make sure hearing protection fits correctly.

The Pentagon funding could provide a much-needed boost to barracks maintenance, military health care and other areas that directly affect the well-being of service members.
Apart from barracks, the quality-of-life funding in the bill includes $2 billion for defense health programs, which have faced shortages in recent years.
""President Trump's One, Big, Beautiful Bill is great for our veterans and military families,"" Kelly, the White House spokesperson, added in a statement Thursday.
Related: Republicans Unveil Pentagon Portion of Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' with Extra Money for Barracks Story Continues","A plan to inject $8.5 billion into military quality-of-life initiatives overcame a key hurdle early Thursday morning as House Republicans narrowly approved a sweeping bill to enact President Donald Trump's legislative agenda.

The quality-of-life funding is part of $150 billion for the Defense Department that Republicans included in what they are officially calling the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a wide-ranging legislative package that touches everything from taxes to health care to border policy.

The Pentagon funding could provide a much-needed boost to barracks maintenance, military health care and other areas that directly affect the well-being of service members. But military and veterans advocates have expressed concerns about other aspects of the bill, particularly cuts to a federal food benefits program and the repeal of a rule that restrains for-profit colleges from targeting veterans.

The bill must still pass the Senate, where there will almost certainly be further changes to win over some Republicans skeptical about various aspects, including the food assistance cuts. But the House passage -- which came in a party-line 215-214 vote at about 6 a.m. Thursday -- is a key milestone in the process.

""Without this generational investment in national defense, we will no longer be able to deter our adversaries or ensure America's global leadership,"" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said in a statement after the vote. ""The One Big Beautiful Bill provides long overdue resources to modernize our military, revitalize the defense industrial base and improve the quality of life for our service members.""

The two biggest pots of Pentagon funding in the bill are $34 billion for shipbuilding and $25 billion for the Golden Dome, which is Trump's proposal for a space-based missile defense shield over the U.S.

Of the $8.5 billion that would go toward military quality-of-life issues, $1.3 billion is devoted to barracks maintenance and restoration across the military services.

The military has faced years of problems with squalid living conditions for its most junior troops, and military officials have often blamed persistent underfunding of housing for the issue.

In addition to the barracks funding, the bill would also provide temporary authorization for more widespread barracks privatization, an idea that has gained steam in recent years as the services have struggled with maintenance backlogs.

A recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, estimated that the two barracks privatization-related provisions in the bill could increase government spending by about $2 billion over 10 years.

Apart from barracks, the quality-of-life funding in the bill includes $2 billion for defense health programs, which have faced shortages in recent years. There is also $2.9 billion for Basic Allowance for Housing payments, $50 million for special pay and bonuses, $100 million for child-care fee assistance for service members, and $10 million for military spouse professional licensure fee assistance.

Elsewhere in the bill, a food assistance program that many military families rely on is facing steep cuts.

Under the bill, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is often referred to as food stamps, would receive less federal funding, and states would be required to make up the difference.

Anti-hunger and military families advocates, as well as governors and other state officials across the country, have been warning that states will not be able to handle the extra budget burden and will need to cut benefits, restrict eligibility or, in the worst-case scenario, stop offering SNAP in the state altogether. Since military families are among SNAP beneficiaries, they would undoubtedly be swept up in the cuts, advocates say.

The White House is pushing back on the idea that military families would be affected by the SNAP cuts.

""President Trump is strengthening SNAP for Americans who need it -- especially military families -- to ensure these programs are sustainable for future generations,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.

Senate Republicans have reacted tepidly to the state cost-sharing plan for SNAP. In a statement last week, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., said the Senate ""will carefully consider the House's approach,"" while stopping short of endorsing it.

Republicans are using a process known as reconciliation that will allow them to pass the bill in the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed for most legislation. That means they won't need any Democratic votes, but they will still have to overcome any intra-party disputes.

Veterans organizations are also hoping senators will make changes to the education policy portion of the bill. In particular, they are sounding the alarm about the fact the bill would repeal what's known as the 90/10 rule, which limits how much of a for-profit school's revenue can come from federal student aid.

A loophole in the rule that allowed shady for-profit schools to take advantage of veterans' GI Bill benefits was closed in 2023. But advocates are warning that repealing the rule altogether could lead to for-profit schools once again scamming veterans out of their education benefits.

Republicans have argued the rule unfairly targets for-profit colleges and that repealing it would expand educational opportunities by treating all types of schools the same.

""President Trump's One, Big, Beautiful Bill is great for our veterans and military families,"" Kelly, the White House spokesperson, added in a statement Thursday. ""By delivering the largest tax cut for middle and working-class Americans in history, ensuring greater educational choices for veterans and strengthening SNAP, this president is dedicated to delivering on his campaign promises and ensuring our men and women in uniform have the support they need.""

A CBO estimate released last week said that repealing the 90/10 rule could increase federal spending by $1.6 billion, including increasing veterans education benefits costs by about $25 million.

Since Senate Republicans were instrumental in the bipartisan deal that closed the loophole in the 90/10 rule, veterans advocates are leaning on them now to keep the rule alive.

""This cannot and should not be allowed to be included in the final bill, and IAVA and the veterans you see here today will fight tooth and nail to make sure it does not happen,"" Allison Jaslow, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said at a news conference last week. ""I can tell you that there are members of the majority in the Senate who are watching this closely and aren't liking what they're seeing. They're just not saying so publicly yet.""

Our admissions team is experienced in working with military insurance and can help you navigate the process—from verifying coverage to coordinating care.

What Is TRICARE East?

TRICARE East is one of two regional TRICARE programs that provide health coverage to eligible active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees, and their families. Administered by Humana Military, TRICARE East covers a large portion of the eastern and southeastern United States. It offers access to a broad network of civilian healthcare providers who meet Department of Defense standards.

As a TRICARE Prime plan, TRICARE East is known for its robust behavioral health coverage, making it a strong option for those seeking support for substance use disorders, mental health conditions, or dual diagnosis treatment. Many of the services offered at Sober First Recovery fall within TRICARE East rehab coverage and are approved when deemed medically necessary.

Behavioral health benefits under TRICARE East include:

Inpatient detox and rehabilitation programs

Partial hospitalization programs (PHP)

Intensive outpatient programs (IOP)

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)

Psychiatric evaluations and medication management

Trauma therapy for PTSD and co-occurring conditions

Individual, group, and family therapy

Veteran Addiction Treatment Through TRICARE East

Veterans face unique challenges that can make substance use and mental health issues more complex. Prolonged stress, trauma, moral injury, and difficulty reintegrating into civilian life often contribute to substance use disorders. TRICARE East substance use benefits help ensure that military members and their families can access care tailored to these challenges.

At Sober First Recovery, we provide trauma-informed, evidence-based care that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of addiction. Our team understands military culture and the demands of service, and we are committed to treating each client with compassion, respect, and clinical excellence.

What Addiction and Mental Health Services Are Covered?

Sober First Recovery offers a complete continuum of care, much of which is covered by TRICARE East depending on the individual’s clinical needs and benefit eligibility:

Medical Detox Coordination

While Sober First does not directly provide detox services, we refer clients to in-network, TRICARE-approved facilities that offer 24/7 medical supervision during withdrawal. We coordinate your care from start to finish to ensure a safe transition into treatment.

Residential Treatment Program (RTC)

Our residential program provides immersive, 24/7 care in a supportive and structured environment. Veterans in RTC receive daily individual and group therapy, medication management, and holistic services such as mindfulness, fitness, and peer support. TRICARE East rehab coverage typically includes residential services when deemed medically necessary.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP)

PHP is an ideal step-down from RTC or a higher level of outpatient care for veterans who still need daily structure and intensive support. Our PHP includes multiple therapy sessions each day, access to medication management, and individualized treatment planning.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)

For veterans who need flexibility while maintaining recovery progress, IOP provides structured therapy several times per week. TRICARE East IOP benefits help veterans transition into daily life while continuing to receive high-quality care.

Outpatient and Aftercare Services

We believe recovery doesn’t end with discharge. Our outpatient therapy and aftercare services include weekly sessions, peer group involvement, relapse prevention planning, and alumni support. TRICARE East typically covers ongoing outpatient care as part of long-term recovery planning.

Virtual Therapy and Telehealth Services

For those unable to attend in-person sessions, our HIPAA-compliant virtual care platform makes it easy to access therapy from anywhere in the TRICARE East region. Veterans in rural or underserved areas can receive the same high-quality care from the comfort and privacy of their home.

Dual Diagnosis and Mental Health Support

Many veterans live with co-occurring disorders—conditions where substance use and mental health issues like PTSD, depression, or anxiety exist simultaneously. TRICARE East mental health coverage ensures that these underlying issues can be addressed alongside addiction treatment.

Sober First Recovery specializes in dual diagnosis care that integrates trauma therapy, medication management, and therapeutic support into every level of treatment. Veterans deserve care that treats the whole person—not just the symptoms.

DEFENDER 25 is a major annual U.S. Army exercise, involving approximately 12,000 U.S. servicemembers and 13,000 troops from 29 partner nations.

The exercise underscores the Department of Defense’s commitment to bolstering Warfighter lethality and combatant command readiness across Europe.

During Swift Response, the initial phase of DEFENDER 25, OPMED’s Force Health Protection, or FHP, team provided essential support and expertise to U.S. Army medical providers assigned to the 512th Field Hospital, 519th Hospital Center, 68th Theater Medical Command and 30th Medical Brigade; and 173rd Airborne Brigade.

FHP plays a critical role in bridging medical gaps by providing investigational medical products, which are authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, to the joint force. This occurs when no FDA-approved solution is available or feasible to meet operational requirements, according to U.S. Army Col. Chuck Bane, director of FHP. His team works with combatant commands and regulatory experts across the globe to make lifesaving treatments available to Warfighters when there is an urgent need.

The 512th Field Hospital, based at Kaiserslautern, Germany as part of 519th Hospital Center, established far-forward medical facilities in support of DEFENDER 25 at Vepriai Rocket Base. Part of the DEFENDER 2025 Hospital Exercise included the strategic deployment of prophylactic drug treatments that are designed to counter potential airborne biological weapon threats against U.S. joint forces operating in challenging and remote locations.

In partnership with the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense Enabling Biotechnologies, JPEO-CBRND-EB — which manages the Rapid Access to Products in Development, RAPID, program — FHP assessed the 512th Field Hospital’s capability to adhere to regulatory requirements for transporting, storing and administering a simulated investigational pre-exposure treatment made available under an investigational new drug expanded access protocol in forward operational areas.

Under a concept of operations created by the JPEO-CBRND-EB RAPID team, a notional treatment was pre-staged in Germany in the weeks leading up to DEFENDER 25 through collaboration and logistical planning between FHP, JPEO-CBRND, the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Distribution Operations Center, and the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Europe. During DEFENDER 2025, the FHP team worked with medics and medical officers on the ground at Vepriai Rocket Base to ensure all EAP use guidelines were followed, according to Chris Weselek, a product manager with FHP and a retired U.S. Army combat medic.

""Our priority is to equip our medical personnel with the confidence and understanding to safely and effectively utilize investigational medical countermeasures when standard options are unavailable,"" said Weselek. ""This collaboration with the RAPID team at DEFENDER 25 highlights the capability that the RAPID program will bring to the table while allowing us to validate our training and oversight processes in a realistic operational setting.""",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/05/23/0893ad4b/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-23 10:56:23.391014
