Outside of Tricare open season, beneficiaries can enroll or change their enrollment following certain life events, including marriage, the birth of a child or retirement from active duty.
Open season does not apply to active-duty service members.
Premium-based plans, including Tricare Reserve Select, Retired Reserve and Young Adult, also are not impacted by open season.
Open season for FEDVIP is Nov. 10–Dec.","Beginning Nov. 10, military retirees and eligible beneficiaries who use Tricare can enroll in or make changes to their health care coverage.

Tricare open season, which runs through Dec. 9, allows beneficiaries who use Tricare Prime, Tricare Select or the U.S. Family Health Plan to stay on their plan, enroll in a plan or change plans. Changes go into effect Jan. 1.

Beneficiaries who are satisfied with their plan don’t need to do anything—their coverage will continue automatically for 2026.

Those who are not already in a plan and don’t enroll during open season could still receive care, but they will “only be eligible for care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available,” according to the Tricare website. Outside of Tricare open season, beneficiaries can enroll or change their enrollment following certain life events, including marriage, the birth of a child or retirement from active duty.

For 2026, active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members In Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, also can enroll in a new Tricare Prime option. Managed by CareSource Military and Veterans, enrollees will get care from CareSource’s network of primary and specialty care providers. Part of a three-year test, the program aims to give beneficiaries an additional option while improving access to care, officials said when the program was announced in May.

Open season does not apply to active-duty service members. It also does not apply to Tricare for Life—coverage is automatic for eligible beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B, according to Tricare.

Premium-based plans, including Tricare Reserve Select, Retired Reserve and Young Adult, also are not impacted by open season. Eligible beneficiaries can buy these plans at any time throughout the year, according to Tricare.

Additionally, eligible military beneficiaries have until Dec. 8 to enroll in or make changes to their vision and/or dental coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. Known as FEDVIP, the program, managed by the Office of Personnel Management, offers a range of plans at varying costs, and coverage is not automatic, so beneficiaries must act to enroll in a dental or vision plan.

We're talking with CareSource Military & Veterans about the upcoming Harvest of Happiness event and their TRICARE Prime® Demo program.

Harvest of Happiness is happening on November 19 at MacDill Air Force Base, where Thanksgiving meals will be distributed to more than 1,200 military members and their families.

President Holly Joers says they know that for military families, especially during the holidays, the little things can feel like big things — a warm meal, a helping hand, a moment of connection. Partnering with Harvest to Happiness lets them show up in those quiet, meaningful ways.

That same spirit is behind the company's work with the TRICARE Prime® Demo in Tampa. Families deserve care that sees the full picture, not just the paperwork. Whether it’s a community event or coordinating health care, they want military families to feel supported, seen, and less alone.

Veterans Day is more than a date on the calendar; it’s a reminder that freedom and security come at a cost, and that those who served our nation are entitled to the same sense of safety and peace they fought to protect.

One of the most powerful ways to show appreciation is by helping our veterans make the most of the benefits they’ve earned. Today’s array of federal programs covering health care, housing, education, insurance, and retirement savings can provide a strong foundation for lifelong financial stability. But these benefits are complex and often underused. Knowing where to start can make all the difference.

Mapping your benefits to a real plan

Veterans’ finances are different because military service connects to nearly every part of a financial plan. Health care, disability compensation, GI Bill education benefits, TRICARE, and tax-free payments all interact in ways that can either strengthen or complicate a family’s long-term goals.

Begin by taking inventory. Gather your service record and note any exposure history, since the PACT Act has expanded eligibility for health care and disability compensation to many veterans who were previously excluded. Verify your disability rating and dependent status and review your education benefits under the Post-9/11 or Montgomery GI Bill programs.

Even if you are healthy, enrolling in VA health care is an important step. It keeps your record active, builds a relationship with a primary care provider, and makes future claims easier to process. Think of it as a continuation of the self-care that keeps you and your family strong.

For those receiving disability benefits, note that payments increased by 2.5% for 2025, reflecting the latest cost-of-living adjustment.

Housing: turning service into stability

Few benefits have transformed more lives than the VA home loan. For veterans with full entitlement, there are no loan limits. This presents an enormous advantage for buyers in higher-cost housing markets. The program’s funding fee can often be waived for service-connected disability, and closing timelines today can rival conventional loans when paperwork is in order.

For veterans considering a move, understanding entitlement restoration rules can help preserve eligibility for future purchases. Home ownership remains one of the most enduring ways to build wealth, and the VA loan continues to make that dream attainable for those who served.

Education and career transitions

Education has long been part of America’s promise to its veterans. The GI Bill still offers some of the most generous tuition and housing benefits available anywhere. As of Aug. 1, 2025, new academic-year rates are in effect through July 2026, with the monthly housing allowance tied to the rate for an E-5 with dependents in the school’s ZIP code.

A major change this year comes from the Supreme Court’s Rudisill v. McDonough decision, which allows many veterans who earned both the Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bills to use both programs for up to 48 months of combined education benefits. That is a significant win for those pursuing new careers or credentials after service.

Veterans who have completed their education have the option to transfer their education benefits to a spouse or child, creating a meaningful legacy. Before enrolling, use the VA’s GI Bill Comparison Tool to evaluate programs and ensure the school is fully accredited and transparent about costs.

Preserving income, insurance and retirement

Financial security also depends on preserving income and protecting loved ones. The VA’s VALife program, introduced in 2023, offers guaranteed-acceptance whole-life insurance coverage up to $40,000 for veterans age 80 or younger. Those currently insured under the older S-DVI program have until Dec. 31, 2025, to apply for VALife while maintaining existing coverage during the two-year transition period.

As of this fall, more than $2 billion in VALife coverage has been issued, proof that many veterans are taking advantage of this new option. Meanwhile, TRICARE premiums and dental fees for 2025 have been updated; small adjustments can add up over time, so be sure to account for those in your budget.

Service members under the Blended Retirement System should continue contributing enough to capture the 5% Thrift Savings Plan match. This effectively is free money, and one of the simplest ways to strengthen long-term security. And remember that VA disability payments are tax-free, which can affect whether a Roth or traditional account makes more sense for your retirement savings.

Five fast moves every veteran should consider

Document any toxic exposure: The PACT Act expansions mean more veterans now qualify for early care and compensation.

Time your education start: GI Bill housing allowances reset each Aug. 1, so plan enrollment around that date.

Check your Certificate of Eligibility: Full entitlement can remove loan limits under the VA program.

Review your life insurance coverage: Compare private-term policies with the new VALife program, especially before the 2025 S-DVI deadline.

Revisit your TRICARE budget: Premium and dental costs changed this year, adjust accordingly.

A message of gratitude

This Veterans Day, our gratitude extends beyond words. We thank every service member and family who has shouldered the burden of duty and wish to remind them that financial well-being is part of the peace they’ve earned.

Take this Veterans Day as a moment to review your benefits, update your plan, and ensure the security you defended continues here at home.

This seems contradictory to the shutdown guidance exempting private-sector care from the shutdown’s effects.
TRICARE also says the open season enrollment window for 2026 coverage remains on schedule despite the shutdown.
Furloughs among non-excepted Defense civilians slow everything from maintenance to program management to installation services.
The Bottom Line for Readiness From flight demonstrations to weekend drills to program awards, the shutdown is eroding predictability.","The federal government shut down at 11:59 p.m. EDT on September 30, 2025. Under the government’s official “Lapse in Appropriations” guidance, uniformed personnel stay on duty and most Defense civilians supporting “excepted” missions continue working, but normal pay is paused until Congress enacts funding. The formal Defense guidance for this shutdown reiterates that active servicemembers “may be assigned to carry out non-excepted activities in place of furloughed civilian personnel only to the extent that the non-excepted activity is capable of performance without incurring new obligations.

Paycheck Funding

Mid-month, President Trump directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” so troops would receive pay despite the lapse. Reporting indicates the department moved to repurpose about $8 billion in unobligated R&D accounts to cover the October 15 payroll, and later acknowledged accepting a $130 million private donation to help offset military pay. Those extraordinary measures do not fully resolve uncertainty.

Training and Drill Impacts

Across the reserve component, routine training weekends are being postponed in many places. The National Guard Association of the United States advises that typical drill periods are not authorized during a shutdown unless they support excepted activities, and units are issuing state-by-state guidance.

High-visibility events are taking hits, too. The Navy’s Blue Angels skipped San Francisco Fleet Week this month because of the shutdown’s travel and funding limits. The team’s annual homecoming at NAS Pensacola was cancelled entirely, as base officials cited uncertainty around funding and logistics.

Health Care and TRICARE

Defense Health Agency operations continue in a constrained environment. TRICARE has told beneficiaries that they may keep appointments with civilian providers and that coverage remains in effect, but the agency has warned that processing and paying new medical claims for care received on or after October 1 may be delayed until funding is restored. This seems contradictory to the shutdown guidance exempting private-sector care from the shutdown’s effects. TRICARE also says the open season enrollment window for 2026 coverage remains on schedule despite the shutdown.

Commissaries, Schools, and On-Base Life

Defense Commissary Agency leaders say stores are operating normally for now and have enough working-capital funding to continue operations for at least 60 days, but have cautioned that extended lapses could force closures when funds are exhausted. Local updates from installations echo that message: commissaries remain open today, while warning that prolonged shutdowns may trigger furloughs and closures.

DoDEA schools have continued operating, but some extracurriculars and support functions are being temporarily paused or cancelled until further notice. Family-support organizations are pointing service members to relief programs and are updating installation-specific changes as they occur.

Civilians, Contractors, and the Industrial Base

The Defense Department relies on a large civilian workforce and a sprawling industrial base. Furloughs among non-excepted Defense civilians slow everything from maintenance to program management to installation services. For industry, the rule of thumb is that work on already-funded contracts continues, but new obligations cannot be made unless the work is tied to an “excepted” activity. This means option awards, new starts, and many modifications stall, with cascading schedule and cost effects that worsen the longer the shutdown runs.

Delays are not abstract. Even a short pause in program actions creates backlogs of source selections, award notices, and production ramp decisions that must all be rescheduled, often pushing milestones into a new quarter and adding cost.

The Bottom Line for Readiness

From flight demonstrations to weekend drills to program awards, the shutdown is eroding predictability. While core operations continue and combatant commands remain manned, the compound effect of delayed training, paused travel, furloughed civilians, and slow-rolling contracts is a readiness tax that grows each week. Commissaries can operate on cash reserves only so long and TRICARE can promise access while warning of delayed payments. Neither of those are durable substitute for appropriations.

What service members and families can do now is practical: confirm unit-level drill and travel guidance; keep scheduled civilian medical appointments but anticipate possible TRICARE claim delays; monitor installation and commissary updates; and, if needed, tap relief resources advertised by commands and service aid societies while Congress works toward a funding bill.

My husband is on recruiting duty for the Army. This is the first place we have been that I’ve had to use Tricare. Everywhere else I was able to use US Family Health plan and had the best experiences. I chose Tricare Select because I wanted some choice in who I saw. I don’t have a problem with the copays, I’m just so frustrated that NO ONE knows how to use Tricare. I literally have to call after every single appointment when I get a bill cause they say my Tricare isn’t active (when it is) and they just refuse to run a manual check. I’ve been at the same place for over a year and still have this problem. We are an hour from an AF base and that’s where my husband goes for medical. I’ve been thinking about changing to Prime since open enrollment is upon us and just saying “f it!” And driving the hour. Problem is… I just found out I’m pregnant. I’m seeing an OB on select who delivers at the only hospital in network within a 30 minute drive. So would changing to prime and driving an hour really be too bad? I just know I can’t keep spending 30 minutes on the phone trying to explain Tricare to someone after every appointment. Plus, trying to figure out where I can get US and I just don’t think I can deal with the stress. All this to say… I hate Tricare.

U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Haleyville) called the Fox Army Health Center's cut in services a ""direct consequence"" of actions from the left.
""On Day 38 of the shutdown, Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center will be reducing services,"" Aderholt said on X.
""The health center will prioritize active-duty personnel's primary care, while reducing Primary Care Medical Home services and suspending all on-post radiology services.","As the ongoing government shutdown enters a record 39th day, Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center is now prioritizing active-duty personnel's primary care, while limiting Primary Medical Home services. According to base officials, all non-urgent primary care needs are currently being redirected to the Tricare network, including radiology services.

The center's pharmacy operations will now be open just Monday through Wednesday. Its script center will remain accessible five days a week. Officials have also said that longer wait times are anticipated for non-urgent care, along with increased use of local urgent care centers and emergency rooms to help offset the reduction in services on base.

Specialty services, including optometry, behavioral health, physical therapy and essential force health protection, will remain operational.

U.S. Rep. Dale Strong (R-Huntsville), who represents the district that includes Redstone Arsenal, laid the blame for the operational changes on Democrats, arguing on X that the shutdown was ""completely avoidable.""

""The fallout from this completely avoidable Democrat shutdown continues to get worse for the folks in North Alabama, including thousands of veterans who rely on Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center for care,"" Strong wrote.

U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Haleyville) called the Fox Army Health Center's cut in services a ""direct consequence"" of actions from the left.

""On Day 38 of the shutdown, Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center will be reducing services,"" Aderholt said on X. ""Another direct consequence of Democrats refusing to open the government.""

""The health center will prioritize active-duty personnel's primary care, while reducing Primary Care Medical Home services and suspending all on-post radiology services. Non-urgent primary care, along with all radiology services, will be diverted to the Tricare network,"" Aderholt added.

Senate Democrats have now voted 14 times against reopening the government, with the most recent vote being 54-44. Democratic leadership on Friday indicated the party may continue to hold out, bolstered by the results in this week's elections.

""Accepting TRICARE allows us to bring this care to the heroes who were never given the chance to actually heal.""","Bionic Bloom Wellness Collective and The Neurodivergent Empowerment Institute (NEI) are proud to announce an expanded access initiative to support United States Veterans seeking trauma recovery and nervous system rehabilitation through integrative mental health treatment - with TRICARE now accepted for covered services.

This marks a groundbreaking shift in veteran care accessibility and aligns with the national urgency to provide trauma-informed, non-harm-based, non-pharmaceutical dependent pathways for healing.

The announcement will formally be introduced at the Cannadelic Global Summit on November 9, 2025 in St. Petersburg, FL, where Bionic Bloom and NEI will lead multiple sessions on veteran trauma, nervous system biology, and integrative recovery models.

Our Clinical Position:

Veterans do not simply need symptom management.

They need repair.

Repair of identity.

Repair of relational safety.

Repair of self-trust.

Repair of nervous system collapse after years of adaptive survival.

Empowerment-Based Integrated Treatment (EBiT), developed and taught through NEI, provides this exact clinical framework - blending trauma-informed therapy, somatic regulation, psychedelic integration, functional medicine support, and consent-based nervous system recalibration.

If you’re wrestling with questions about your TRICARE coverage, benefits, or claims, you’re definitely not alone. TRICARE’s a solid military health care program, but figuring out who to call or how to get your issue squared away can feel like trying to crack a secret code. Whether you’re a service member, family member, or retired military, understanding where to start is crucial. So, what are the usual reasons folks reach out to TRICARE?

Updating or verifying coverage and enrollment details.

Getting help with claims and understanding benefits.

Finding in-network providers or urgent care info.

Managing your military health system online accounts like milConnect or MHS GENESIS.

Getting answers on pharmacy benefits or prescriptions.

One thing that might surprise you: many TRICARE users trip up when contacting customer service because they jump straight in without their paperwork or digital accounts handy. Having your sponsor’s DOD ID number and your personal info within reach makes the whole process smoother.

Pro Tip: Different questions and regions have different contact points, so knowing which TRICARE area you fall under is key before reaching out.

Channels to Reach TRICARE: Phone, Online, and Mail Breakdown

When it comes to actually contacting TRICARE, you have options, and each carries its own pros and cons. Phone calls can be quick, but wait times vary. Online portals offer convenience but sometimes lack the personal touch. Mail feels a bit old school but is necessary for formal requests or appeals.

By Phone

Dialing up TRICARE directly is often the fastest way to handle urgent issues. You can find the right phone number on the official TRICARE website—there’s a list organized by region and specific services. For instance, the Call Us page breaks down numbers depending on your needs, whether it’s West Region, East Region, or overseas.

Heads up: peak call times can mean long waits. Calling earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon might just save you some time.

Online Portals

TRICARE’s online presence is pretty solid. The Contact Us main page links to milConnect and other tools that let you check your enrollment, claims, and health records. Accessing your online account means you can often resolve simple questions without ever making a call.

This video walks you through a real interaction with TRICARE customer care, highlighting how to find the right number and what kind of questions to ask. It’s a handy watch if you want to mentally prepare before picking up the phone.

Mail and Fax

Though less common, some TRICARE requests still require sending documents by mail or fax, especially for formal appeals or notarized paperwork. Check your specific regional guidelines on the TRICARE site—this is more common when dealing with claims or beneficiary updates.

Not to be overlooked: mailing might add days or even weeks to your timeline, so consider phone or online options first unless the form explicitly says to send hard copies.

Expert Tips for Streamlining Your TRICARE Communication

Want to skip the frustration? Here’s what the pros suggest:

Have your info ready: DOD ID, Social Security number (if required), and a detailed description of your question or issue.

Know your region: TRICARE West, East, or Overseas—this dictates which contact center you’ll deal with.

Use online tools: Many common tasks like checking claim status or updating info can be done through milConnect, saving you time on the phone.

Prepare for verification: Customer reps will ask security questions to verify identity for privacy reasons—don’t be thrown off when they do.

Be patient but persistent: Customer service can sometimes get busy, but if you feel stuck, politely ask to escalate to a supervisor.

Also, as highlighted by TriWest Healthcare Alliance’s contact page, having straightforward and clear questions helps reps assist you more effectively—prepping your concerns before the call can shave off a lot of back-and-forth.

Avoiding Pitfalls: Common Mistakes When Contacting TRICARE

Here’s the thing: a lot of the headache comes from avoidable mistakes. Don’t fall into these traps:

Not confirming your region or plan: Calling the wrong number sends you into a loop of transfers.

Skipping account logins: Many issues are resolved online if you just took a minute to set up or access your accounts.

Missing key documents: Not having your ID numbers or claim info handy can turn a quick call into a long crawl.

Rushing without notes: Juggling complicated benefits questions without jotting down reps’ names or reference numbers leads to confusion later.

Newcomers especially forget that TRICARE covers different services under different contractors, so asking a generic question can cause mixed info. Narrow down your inquiry before calling.

What to Expect During Your TRICARE Inquiry: Timeline and Responses

When you contact TRICARE, keep in mind the timeline can shift based on the type of inquiry:

Typical TRICARE Inquiry Response Times Inquiry Type Response Mode Expected Response Time Claims and Billing Questions Phone & Online Within 1-3 business days Enrollment or Coverage Changes Phone, Online, or Mail Up to 2 weeks (mail longer) Pharmacy & Prescription Issues Phone Within 24-48 hours General Benefits Questions Phone & Online Within 1-5 business days

Don’t expect instant resolution every time—some questions require checking with medical providers or verification from other agencies.

Step-by-Step Guide: Preparing Before You Contact TRICARE

Getting your ducks in a row before you pick up the phone or jump into your online account can turn what feels like a daunting chore into a breeze.

Step 1: Identify Your Plan and Region

First, double-check which TRICARE plan you have (Prime, Select, Young Adult, etc.) and the region (East, West, Overseas). This info steers you toward the right contact point.

Step 2: Gather Personal Information

Have your sponsor’s DOD ID number, your Social Security number if applicable, date of birth, and any claim or case numbers ready.

Step 3: Write Down Your Questions

Jot down what you want to ask, including any related dates, provider names, or claim details. This helps keep the conversation focused.

Step 4: Choose Your Contact Method

If it’s a quick status check, online is great. For complex issues, pick up the phone. And for formal updates or appeals, consider mail.

Step 5: Have Pen and Paper Ready

During your contact, write down the names of reps, confirmation numbers, and any details on next steps.

I’ll speak not just as a retired pediatrician, but as someone who once believed that measurable goals were enough.","For decades, I practiced developmental-behavioral pediatrics with a focus on coordinated care, measurable goals, and clinical accountability. I believed that if we could define a child’s needs clearly and track progress with integrity, we could build systems that honored both science and dignity.

But I now realize I missed something critical.

After reviewing the #BanABA initiative and speaking with Dr. Henny Kupferstein, I’ve come to understand the full scope of harm linked to applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy. This isn’t just about outdated methods or billing irregularities. It’s about documented patterns of physical and psychological trauma, especially among nonspeaking autistic individuals and those who rely on AAC. It’s about a system that too often prioritizes compliance over communication, normalization over neurodiversity.

In 2016, I raised formal concerns about the TRICARE ABA pilot in Washington State. United HealthCare (UHC) stonewalled the inquiry. For them it was a big moneymaker, without oversight from the DOD. I was the one who attempted oversight after receiving a communication from Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The army labeled me as a troublemaker and forced me into learning the SBAR communication method. Despite that, it was “good trouble,” using Representative John Lewis’ definition: when the senator and I questioned both the cost and the absence of measurable goals needed to justify continued paying for services under the pilot. UHC considered the pilot as an entitlement to increase corporate profits only, not to help children with ASD. That obstruction may have triggered Congress to authorize the largest ABA study ever conducted under TRICARE. But the study focused on cost-effectiveness, not trauma. I was asking about harm. About dignity. About whether we were truly helping the children we claimed to serve.

Earlier in my career, as medical director of the Autism Program at Easter Seals in Peoria, I routinely marked “NMG” (No Measurable Goals) in red Sharpie on therapy proposals for ABA, PT, OT, and speech that lacked clinical rigor. I was supported by the clinic director and the pediatric chairman. We weren’t rejecting therapy; we were demanding accountability. But even then, I didn’t fully grasp the trauma described by autistic adults and self-advocates.

I now recognize that ABA’s faults go far deeper than poor documentation:

A harmful focus on conformity: Many self-advocates argue that ABA’s goal of making autistic individuals appear “normal” can punish harmless traits like stimming or echolalia.

Psychological harm: Research and personal accounts suggest that behavior modification, when coercive, can cause lasting trauma and reinforce the idea that autistic ways of being are inherently wrong.

Better alternatives exist: Communication-based therapies, especially those that honor autonomy and consent, may offer more meaningful support, particularly for nonspeaking individuals who use behavior as language.

This isn’t just a clinical debate. It’s a civic reckoning.

I’ve come to understand that ABA’s widespread adoption was not driven by consensus among developmental pediatricians, but by insurance mandates, billing incentives, and a cultural push for normalization. In many cases, ABA was the only reimbursable option, regardless of its appropriateness or ethical standing. Families were cornered. Clinicians were pressured. And children were subjected to interventions that may have caused more harm than help.

So, what are the alternatives?

There are evidence-informed, dignity-centered approaches that prioritize communication, autonomy, and relationship-building over compliance:

Developmental and relationship-based models (e.g., DIR/Floortime): These approaches focus on emotional connection, co-regulation, and following the child’s lead. They support social-emotional development without coercion.

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) support: For nonspeaking individuals, access to robust AAC systems, paired with communication partners trained in modeling and respect, is essential. Communication is not a reward; it’s a right.

Occupational therapy with a sensory integration lens: When practiced ethically, OT can help children understand and regulate their sensory experiences without suppressing natural behaviors.

Presume competence frameworks: These approaches reject deficit-based assumptions and instead presume that every individual has the capacity to learn, communicate, and participate meaningfully, given the right supports.

Peer-mediated and naturalistic interventions: These emphasize learning in real-world contexts, often with neurotypical peers, and avoid rigid drill-based instruction.

These models are not perfect, but they are rooted in respect. They prioritize consent. They do not rely on token economies, forced eye contact, or compliance as a proxy for progress.

I now support a federal ban on coercive behavioral interventions. I believe it’s time to listen to autistic voices, not override them. It’s time to stop rewarding systems that monetize compliance and start investing in models that respect neurodiversity, autonomy, and informed consent.

This shift is personal. It’s professional. And it’s overdue.

I’ll appear on The Podcast by KevinMD to share this journey, from early objection to ethical awakening. I’ll speak not just as a retired pediatrician, but as someone who once believed that measurable goals were enough. They’re not. Not if the goals themselves are rooted in erasure.

I’ll also speak as an author. In my memoir The Quiet Architect, I reflect on the systems we build, and the ones we must dismantle. I’ve included an excerpt that documents my early challenge to ABA at the federal level, supported by Senator John McCain. That moment wasn’t just a clinical objection. It was a warning.

Today, I add my voice to the #BanABA initiative. I do so with humility, clarity, and resolve. I do so knowing that silence is complicity, and that legacy is not just what we build, but what we’re willing to unbuild.

This is my public pivot. My red Sharpie moment has become a reckoning.

You lost me here. How else can I get this insurance if I can't be the sponsor? My wife is not military and is not FEHB eligible (i.e. does not have a government job).

2) (insert dumb and dumber meme gif) ...so you're telling me there's a chance that the goal post can be moved from 1/1/30 to a sooner date?

Yeah I read about the new legislation and thought the same thing.

This study assessed whether statin use after lung cancer diagnosis is associated with overall survival among MHS beneficiaries with lung cancer. METHODS: This study was based on the Military Cancer Epidemiology (MilCanEpi) database, a database linking the DoD's Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and the MHS Data Repository (MDR). The study subjects were MHS beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Information on statin use was extracted from the database. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) comparing post-diagnosis use of statin relative to non-users. RESULTS: Among the 5096 patients, 864 patients used a statin after NSCLC diagnosis. Compared to individuals who never used statin, increased cumulative use of statin (per one-year of use) among the users conferred a significantly improved survival with an adjusted HR of 0.82 (95% CI=0.75-0.90). In stratified analysis, the survival benefit or its tendency associated with increased cumulative use was observed regardless of age, race, sex, tumor stage, comorbidity index or baseline use. CONCLUSIONS: Post-diagnosis statin use was associated with improved survival among NSCLC patients in a universal healthcare system.

The impact of exposure to morally injurious events on posttraumatic stress symptoms among Israeli combat Veterans: a longitudinal moderated mediation model of moral injury outcomes and dispositional forgiveness

Abstract: Background: Exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) during military service can lead to moral injury (MI) outcomes and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). This longitudinal study examined the relationships between PMIE exposure, MI outcomes, and PTSS among Israeli combat veterans, and the potential protective role of dispositional forgiveness in these associations. Method: Participants were 169 Israeli combat veterans who participated in a six-year longitudinal study with four measurement points (T1: 12 months before enlistment, T2: Six months following enlistment- pre-deployment, T3: 18 months following enlistment- post-deployment, and T4: 28 months following discharge). Participants’ characteristics were assessed via semi-structured interviews (T1) and validated self-report measures (T2-T4) between 2019-2024. Results: Approximately 36% of participants reported exposure to PMIEs during service, with 13% exceeding the clinical threshold for probable PTSD at T4. PMIE-Betrayal at T3 was positively associated with MI outcomes of shame and trust violation at T4. The indirect effect of PMIEs on PTSS through MI outcome-Shame depended on forgiveness levels. Among veterans with low forgiveness, higher exposure to PMIE-Betrayal was associated with increased MI shame, which was linked to more severe PTSS. Conversely, for those with high forgiveness, exposure to PMIE-Self and Other was associated with decreased MI shame and subsequently reduced PTSS. Conclusion: Dispositional forgiveness moderates the relationship between PMIE exposure and MI outcomes, particularly shame, which mediates the development of PTSS. These findings highlight forgiveness as a potential target for intervention in treating moral injury and preventing PTSS among combat veterans.",https://www.centreforevidence.org/website/img/og--default.png,N,0.0,2025-11-07 20:22:07.473811
