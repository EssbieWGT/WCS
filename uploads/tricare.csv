It’s a day to safely dispose of unwanted, expired, or excess medications. But it’s also important to know that military pharmacies offer ways to safely dispose of drugs all year long through the Military Health System Drug Take Back program.

“National Drug Take Back Day promotes a healthier community by helping to prevent accidental misuse of expired or unused drugs,” said U.S. Army Maj. Danielle Zsido, Direct Care Branch Deputy Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the Defense Health Agency. “It also helps protect the environment by reducing the chemicals that can enter our water system.”

Keep reading to learn more about why—and how—you should dispose of expired or unused drugs.

Why you should dispose of old prescriptions

Keeping expired or unused prescriptions at home can be risky. Children might find them, or someone might misuse them. Disposing of old prescriptions from home helps prevent potential harm and medication misuse.

Additionally, throwing drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet can harm our water supply and soil. When you dispose of drugs properly, you:

• Keep children safe from accidental poisoning

• Help prevent potential drug misuse

• Protect your environment

• Help keep your community safe

How military pharmacies help

Per Drug Enforcement Administration rules, pharmacists and other pharmacy staff can’t physically accept patients’ drugs for disposal. This is why you must physically put the drugs in the collection bin or envelope yourself, though the pharmacy is happy to provide you with the drug disposal receptacle. Every military pharmacy offers at least one way to dispose of drugs:

• Secure blue drop boxes where you can leave unused drugs

• Secure mail-in envelopes you can take home

The process is simple. Before you drop them off, just remove or black out your personal information on the labels.

What you can drop off

You can dispose of most drugs, including:

• Prescription drugs

• Over-the-counter drugs

• Vitamins and supplements

• Pet medications

• Controlled substance prescription drugs

Note: You can’t dispose of more than four ounces of liquid drugs. You also can’t dispose needles, aerosol cans, or illegal drugs. If you aren’t sure whether you can drop off a certain item, check the list of items that your pharmacy will accept.

How to get rid of your expired or unused medications

Follow these simple steps:

• Find your military pharmacy by visiting Find a Military Hospital or Clinic or calling directly.

• Ask if they have a drop box or secure mail-in envelopes.

• Remove personal information from prescription containers.

• Drop off drugs during regular pharmacy hours.

Can’t get to a military pharmacy? The DEA has other drop-off sites on April 26. Check the DEA website to find one near you.

If you can’t get to a drop-off site and must dispose of drugs at home, follow these steps:

• Remove drugs from original containers.

• Mix with an undesirable substance like coffee grounds or cat litter.

• Put the mixture in a sealable container.

• Remove personal information from empty containers.

• Place the sealed container in the trash.

Adapted from the article, 'The Medical Surveillance Monthly Report: The First 30 Years,' in the April 2024 MSMR.

This year marks a significant milestone for the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report as we celebrate its 30th anniversary.

Throughout its three decades, MSMR has continuously improved its content with the goal of providing readers with unbiased, scientifically rigorous, evidence-based medical surveillance information on the current status, trends, and determinants of the physical and mental health of U.S. military service members.

“MSMR’s role within and supporting the overall mission of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Public Health Division, and the Defense Health Agency remains vital,” said MSMR editor-in-chief Robert Johnson, MD, MPH, MBA.

“The need for appropriate database utilization, information review, and methodologically valid analysis remains the ‘gold standard’ of epidemiological surveillance and medical knowledge development,” said Johnson.

MSMR aims to provide military public health leaders and line staff officers with timely access to militarily-relevant, readiness-focused, routine and specialized reports. This access also helps them to identify and contain outbreaks, understand disease burden, guide policy changes, and evaluate and improve prevention and control strategies.

MSMR History

The need for a publication like MSMR became evident in the early 1990s due to the lack of distribution of routine periodic medical surveillance in the U.S. military, worsened by the end of publication of service-specific surveillance reports, including Health of the Army and Statistics of Navy Medicine in the late 1980s. At the time, there were no ready or centrally available sources of timely and reliable information on existing medical threats, and published insights on medical situational awareness were generally out-of-date, incomplete, and largely uninformative.

One of MSMR’s core functions was to report routine monthly surveillance statistics not otherwise readily available to intended readership. MSMR was also intended to emulate, for the U.S. military, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, or MMWR, published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Like MMWR, MSMR is a mechanism to distribute public health data and reports, targeted mostly to military public health professionals, in addition to military commanders, leaders, and policymakers, as well as the scientific and lay press.

MSMR Milestones

Since its beginning, MSMR has achieved many milestones. In 2011, it was accepted for indexing in MEDLINE, the principal online bibliographic citation database of the National Library of Medicine’s MEDLARS® system. MSMR’s inclusion in MEDLINE not only helped to expand the scope and reach of MSMR’s content, but also increased the number and quality of external submissions from potential authors.

The establishment of the Defense Health Agency formally consolidated the medical services of all branches of the U.S. military, which included integration of all U.S. military public health surveillance activities. These integration efforts reinforced MSMR’s focus on reporting results for all service branches.

Over the past decade, MSMR has continued to explore ways to expand and improve its content and make it more readily usable to readers. MSMR increased its production of thematic issues and made significant efforts to engage subject matter experts throughout the Military Health System. These thematic issues have focused on a wide range of subjects including overall health, mental and behavioral health, heat illness and injury, sexually transmitted infections, gastrointestinal infections, and vision-related conditions. A Global Emerging Infections Surveillance-themed issue featured surveillance reports from GEIS partners.

U.S. Navy Capt. Richard Langton, MD, MPH, chief of AFHSD, confirmed the publication’s value.

“For 30 years, the MSMR has advanced military public health surveillance, research, policy, practice, and education influencing the discussion at the intersection of health readiness and military operations,"" Langton said. ""Congratulations to the MSMR team for the standard they’ve set for military health surveillance. May the great reporting continue for the next thirty years.”

As MSMR enters its 31st year, its editorial staff aims to continue its tradition of excellence while making its content more clinically relevant, continuing to increase collaboration with external agencies and individuals, publishing topics of military relevance, and making practical, military-specific recommendations.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

As winter’s chill dissipates and spring’s rain gives way to summer’s warmth, we shed layers of clothing and venture outdoors to enjoy the weather.

Spending time outside is a known mood booster. The increased physical activity of outdoor recreation is good for overall health and wellness. However, hidden dangers can lurk among the blossoms – and ticks come out of hiding in the springtime, too.

May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month. Spring is one of the most important times of year to become “tick smart” by learning about the risks ticks pose and how to avoid tick bites. Ticks are tiny and can be hard to notice — even after they bite — due to chemicals in their saliva that make them invisible to our body’s defenses. While not every tick is infected with a disease-causing pathogen, one unlucky bite can infect a person with one or multiple disease agents.

Lyme disease

Lyme disease is by far the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting approximately 476,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The ticks that transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease are called blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks. Their tiny nymphs (smaller than a sesame seed) come out in force during May. More than 25% of blacklegged ticks can be infected with the Lyme pathogen.

Blacklegged ticks can be hard to find and remove quickly because of their small size. During warmer seasons, we tend to wear fewer clothes, making us more susceptible to bites and subsequent infections. It generally takes around 48 hours for a tick to transmit the Lyme disease pathogen, so time is of the essence once one of these bloodsuckers latches on.

For the military community, one weapon in the fight against ticks and Lyme disease is a program known as MilTICK: the Military Tick Identification/Infection Confirmation Kit program. Service members and their families, as well as retirees, civilians, contractors, and others can submit human-biting ticks to the MilTICK program for free and receive an emailed report describing the tick species, how long the tick was attached, and whether or not the tick tested positive for any pathogens.

MilTICK started in 1995 and is run by the Defense Health Agency - Public Health at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Most military clinics have tick kits on site; individuals or clinics can request tick kits by contacting MilTICK program staff. The kits never expire and are great to have on hand, just in case a tick bite occurs.

MilTICK uses the data generated to better understand tick-borne disease risks to the military community. In 2024, over 3,000 ticks were tested; 167 were found to be positive for one or more human pathogens. It might come as no surprise that May is the month when the most Lyme disease agent is detected, although MilTICK has found the Lyme agent in human-biting ticks submitted during every month of the year. The Lyme agent peaks in the spring and fall, when the numbers of nymph and adult ticks are at their highest.

Of course, Lyme disease isn’t the only tick-borne disease out there, and not even the only one you need to worry about from a blacklegged tick bite. Blacklegged ticks also transmit a relapsing fever illness, a bacterial disease called anaplasmosis, a parasitic disease similar to malaria called babesiosis, and Powassan virus, which can cause encephalitis and even death. MilTICK tests for all of these; fortunately, these pathogens are much rarer than the Lyme pathogen. For example, only one confirmed positive tick for Powassan virus has been found since MilTICK started testing for it in 2020.

Other tick species become active in the springtime, too, especially the human-biting lone star tick and the American dog tick. Lone star ticks make up the bulk of ticks received by MilTICK, since they’re the most common tick in the Southeastern U.S., where many military installations are located. Lone star ticks can transmit a disease called ehrlichiosis and have also been associated with a red meat allergy known as alpha gal syndrome.

Your risk of tick-borne disease depends on where you live and how you spend your time. Lyme disease is endemic to the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwestern U.S., where the blacklegged tick is abundant. Move further South and you’re in lone star tick country, where your risk of ehrlichiosis is much higher than your risk of Lyme disease.

To learn more about the risks at your installation, visit the CAC-enabled MilTICK data dashboard and see exactly what kinds of ticks are being submitted from the area where you live.

The more time you spend outside in tick habitat, the greater your risk of a tick bite and potentially developing a tick-borne disease. Treating clothes with tick-killing sprays such as permethrin, using bug spray on exposed skin, and covering up with long pants and socks even during warmer months will all help prevent tick bites.

If you do get bitten, sending the tick for testing through MilTICK can help provide peace of mind if the tick is negative for pathogens. If the tick is positive, the MilTICK report can help your medical provider diagnose and treat any symptoms that may develop.

Taking walks in the woods, playing sports outside with friends, and stopping to smell the flowers are all wonderful ways to enjoy the outdoors this May. Staying aware and being tick smart can help keep you safe all year.

What GAO Found

The Department of Defense's (DOD) Defense Health Agency (DHA) has 13 contracts with private sector companies to provide TRICARE health, dental, and pharmacy benefits generally through networks of civilian providers.

Current TRICARE Contracts for Health, Dental, and Pharmacy Benefits

GAO identified changes in the key characteristics of these current contracts compared with the prior version of these contracts that had recently ended. For example, 11 of the 13 current contracts had an increase in their total contract value at the time of award (i.e., the sum value of the contract's base period including all option years). GAO found various reasons that contributed to the higher award values, including changes in geographic service areas and longer periods of performance. DHA officials also told GAO that health care costs have increased significantly over the last 10 years due to inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic.

GAO also found that seven of the 13 TRICARE contracts were competitively awarded and of those, four received fewer bids for the current contracts compared with the prior contracts. The remaining three competitively awarded contracts received the same number of bids for the current and prior contracts, with one contract receiving a single bid each time. In addition, DHA awarded six of the seven contracts to the incumbent contractors.

Why GAO Did This Study

DOD offers health care services to over 9 million eligible beneficiaries through its TRICARE program. TRICARE beneficiaries may obtain care through either military medical treatment facilities, including medical centers, hospitals, and clinics or through the private sector care system of civilian providers. Within DOD, DHA is responsible for TRICARE, including the award, administration, and oversight of 13 health, dental, and pharmacy contracts used to provide care and services through civilian providers. As of September 30, 2024, these current contracts were collectively valued at about $168 billion.

The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 includes a provision for GAO to report on key characteristics of certain contracts related to the TRICARE program. Some of these key characteristics include total contract values, the products or services procured, and health care or service delivery time frames. Among other things, this report describes changes in the key characteristics between the current and prior TRICARE health, dental, and pharmacy contracts.

GAO analyzed DHA documentation for the current and prior TRICARE contracts for health, dental, and pharmacy benefits. In addition, GAO reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System. GAO also interviewed DHA officials responsible for each of the TRICARE contracts.

A BSI is a type of musculoskeletal overuse injury resulting from gradual, repetitive force on bone tissues.
“Our ongoing studies are finding that NSAIDS may increase BSI risk as much as five times during initial military entry training,” she says.
Recent evidence suggests similar risks among young adults of both genders may contribute to low bone density and thus increase BSI risk.
By reducing BSI rates and severity during initial training, the military can improve the readiness and resilience of its fighting force.","Bone stress injuries, which include stress fractures, can be debilitating to athletes but are also a problem for the U.S. military, according to public health experts.

“Service members who develop BSIs may be placed on a medical profile limiting duty or training activities, or even need orthopedic surgery,” says U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, a physical therapist and chief of the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Injury Prevention Branch at Aberdeen, Maryland.

“By finding ways to prevent and reduce the number and severity of BSIs, the military can improve force readiness, lethality, and reduce costs,” says Lopez.

In pursuit of this goal, experts from the DHA-PH have been studying trends and risk factors of BSI with scientists at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and military leaders at the U.S. Army Training Center at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, an initial entry training installation for nearly half of the U.S. Army.

These scientists now have a better understanding of some factors that may increase the risk of service members’ developing a BSI.

What are bone stress injuries?

A BSI is a type of musculoskeletal overuse injury resulting from gradual, repetitive force on bone tissues. Common activities in the military that cause these injuries are running, marching, and load-bearing exercises. MSK overuse injuries continue to be a primary reason for service members’ medical visits and cost the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“While a gradual increase of exercise and physical activity will encourage bone and other supporting musculoskeletal tissues to strengthen over time, a BSI happens when the bone tissue doesn’t have enough time to build between activities,” says Katelyn Guerriere-Aaron, a senior research physiologist at USARIEM.

DHA-PH injury experts agree.

Lopez explains that BSIs may be missed during an initial medical exam. BSIs may take time to develop, are confused with other types of injuries, or are painless until becoming severe. Catching early signs of BSIs is also difficult with motivated military personnel, who want to ‘tough out’ physical training programs for fear of restarting (known as being “recycled”) or failing military training due to injury.

“Data show most BSIs in the military are to the lower parts of the body. This includes areas extending from the hip down to the toes,” says Ryan Steelman, a DHA-PH injury prevention epidemiologist. “BSIs to the tibia, which includes a condition sometimes referred to as shin splints, are especially common among men. Women more often experience BSI to the hip or the femoral neck, an upper portion of the thigh bone.”

Diagnosing BSI injuries can be challenging, even by doctors.

“BSIs, particularly hips, can be tricky to diagnose as the pain level doesn’t always equal the severity level, and X-ray imaging doesn’t always show early BSI,” says U.S. Army Maj. Gary Helton, assistant chief of the Fort Jackson Department of Sports Medicine. “Tibial BSIs, and hip BSIs, particularly the femoral neck, can lead to a complete fracture needing surgery if not addressed in a timely manner.”

Evidence indicates extensive running and long road marches with heavy rucksacks – especially on consecutive days – are associated with military lower-body MSK injuries like these BSIs.

“These training activities, however, are critical to ensuring personnel are ready for the physical rigors of combat operations,” says Steelman. “By studying BSI trends and risk factors, we are better able to help identify ways to reduce BSI impacts and build more resilient warfighters.”

Who is at risk?

New military recruits are particularly at risk of BSIs because their initial entry training, typically 10 to 16 weeks, often brings a sudden and substantial increase in the amount and intensity of their physical activity. DHA data show that while female service members have a higher risk of BSI, there are almost five times more male service members, so more men than women will develop a BSI.

“We have been diagnosing BSIs in recruits at Fort Jackson for years. A large number of these BSIs are diagnosed as early as the second and third week of training,” says Helton.“The treatment for these BSIs detracts from the success of the training.”

With support from DHA public health experts and USARIEM researchers, Helton has been able to objectively review BSI trends and risk factors and identify potential ways to reduce BSI severity and case numbers.

“Many recruits who are eventually injured in training lead relatively sedentary lives prior to enlistment, so they do not have the foundation necessary for the rigors of military training,” says Helton. “Preparing their bodies with physical training before volunteering for initial military training can reduce their risk of developing a BSI during initial training programs.”

While all forms of exercise before initial military entry can improve fitness, the type of physical activity may also be important.

“Our findings suggest that specific activities that require multi-directional body movement, such as soccer or basketball, may lower rates of BSI more than exercises like running or lifting by helping build stronger overall MSK structure,” says Julie Hughes, a senior researcher and colleague of Guerriere-Aaron at USARIEM.

What risk factors can be controlled?

USARIEM experts have highlighted an especially critical finding that could help reduce the risk of BSI.

“Several studies have pointed to excessive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, during rigorous physical training activities as a factor that will increase BSI risk,” says Guerriere-Aaron. “NSAIDS have also been found to delay healing in those who do have a bone stress injury.”

Hughes agrees that use of NSAIDs, which include products that can be purchased over the counter, such as ibuprofen, may be one of the most significant and preventable risks of BSI.

“Our ongoing studies are finding that NSAIDS may increase BSI risk as much as five times during initial military entry training,” she says.

Many orthopedic doctors are aware that NSAIDs delay healing, but this may not be well known by others in the medical field, says Helton.

“Since NSAIDs can be effective for pain management, many providers may prescribe NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen, for pain,” he says. “But if pain is the result of potential bone injury, research suggests NSAIDS should be avoided.”

Helton points out that recruits in military initial entry training are dependent on military medical providers for any form of medication and typically cannot purchase over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen.

“We are working to ensure military providers are aware of the NSAID risks with bone injuries. This is a key message we want to get out,” he says. “We also discourage NSAID use by recruits who may be able to access NSAIDs over the counter or from a buddy.”

Past evidence has also indicated that low bone density is a risk factor for BSI among young women who have other risk factors. Key underlying risks include poor nutrition and/or being underweight, and excessive exercise. Recent evidence suggests similar risks among young adults of both genders may contribute to low bone density and thus increase BSI risk.

Another consideration Helton observed is the added stress on recruits’ lower body bones during running or ruck march formations if drill sergeants tell recruits to ‘stride it out’, particularly shorter trainees.

“There appears to be more bone stress if a trainee has to change their normal gait and stretch their legs forward to keep up with formation, landing harder on the heel and increasing stress at the hip,” Helton says. “Quicker, shorter steps may be safer, or – even better – putting shorter persons up front in a formation to manage the pace.”

What can be done by service members?

An estimated one-third of applicants to military entry training don’t meet basic military fitness standards. Recruits who are more physically fit before their initial training program have lower BSI rates. Other underlying factors, such as poor diet and lack of sleep, may make some service members more vulnerable to developing a BSI than others.

Lopez recommends that before military initial training, recruits should—

Gradually increase various exercising drills to include agility, power and balance training along with more traditional aerobic endurance (cardio) and strength exercises.

Allow time between exercise sessions for rest and bone recovery.

During training, recruits should —

Avoid NSAIDS for bone pain.

Eat nutritional foods to maintain energy levels.

Prioritize sleep to allow for bone recovery.

Avoid overreaching gaits and striding out; aim for shorter quick steps.

Seek medical assessment at the earliest signs of bone pain and follow recovery treatment plans to avoid more serious BSIs.

By reducing BSI rates and severity during initial training, the military can improve the readiness and resilience of its fighting force.

“Through continued dialogue between Pentagon leadership, frontline providers, and the total force in Japan, the DOD aims to develop tailored solutions to address the distinct challenges of delivering military health care in Japan while maintaining the highest standards of care for service members, their families, and DOD civilian employees,” she said.","Susan Orsega, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, visited military installations in Japan, April 7-11, 2025, to better understand challenges and successes to accessing health care in the region.

Orsega met with military hospital and clinic leaders at Misawa Air Base and Commander, Fleet Activities Yokosuka on mainland Japan and at Camp Foster on the island of Okinawa. Staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs also held listening sessions with Department of Defense civilian employees who are enrolled in the new Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement for DOD Civilian Employees in Japan as part of the pilot's evaluation.

Orsega's visit underscores the DOD’s and the Military Health System's focus on the Indo-Pacific region and commitment to ensuring and improving access to health care for active duty service members, family members, and DOD civilian employees. It also reflects the focus of Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to directly engage with military hospital and clinic staff to understand local challenges and successes.

""When Dr. Ferrara came on board, he gave us clear directives: He challenged us to immerse ourselves in the problems you face daily, especially given the unique complexities of this remote base,"" Orsega shared with military hospital and clinic staff at Misawa’s 35th Medical Group. ""He wanted us to understand your realities, roll up our sleeves, and work collaboratively to make your roles more effective, more efficient, and ultimately, more successful at serving our beneficiaries.""

During staff and leadership engagements, medical personnel in Japan highlighted challenges unique to this remote region. Supply chains face lengthy logistical hurdles, with United States’ medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment requiring more lead time compared to stateside facilities.

As Orsega emphasized during her visits, ""Ensuring that we're supporting our warfighters is a critical component of the Military Health System's mission, alongside sustaining clinical skills and supporting military families.”

This readiness focus takes on heightened significance in the Indo-Pacific region, where military hospitals and clinics operate on the frontline of potential conflict zones.

Despite these challenges, leadership across the MHS in Japan demonstrates “remarkable innovation and collaboration,” Orsega said.

Military hospitals and clinics have successfully built relationships with host nation healthcare systems, overcoming difficult language barriers and different medical practices. Leadership teams work across services, with U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army medical personnel collaborating to provide seamless care, as evidenced by partnerships like the joint neonatal intensive care unit operations and related evacuations between U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa and the U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka

U.S. Navy Capt. Kathleen Cooperman, commanding officer at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, highlighted how staff have remained mission-focused through numerous transitions, including, ""staffing challenges, systems upgrades, changes to financial systems, mergers of dental corps,"" and various inspections. ""Not once did any one of these individuals lose sight of why we're here and what we need to do,"" she emphasized.

A team from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, led by the Chief of Staff Dr. Bryce Slinger, hosted six listening sessions with DOD civilian employees to inform an evaluation of the Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement. The services under this pilot began on Jan. 1, 2025, in response to DOD civilian employees' challenges in navigating the host-nation’s healthcare system. The pilot assists eligible DOD civilian employees with healthcare navigation, including provider-finder services, direct billing agreements, and insurance reimbursement.

The team received positive feedback, though civilians noted gaps in some specialty services, family coverage, and translation services. Based on these qualitative findings, paired with quantitative analysis, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness will determine if the pilot will be extended past the current period of performance, ending on Sept. 29, 2025, and will consider additional solutions to bolster civilian care options.

I called them and they said they only see Tricare on their end, and to call claims to dispute the issue. (My Tricare acct. does not show any OHI) This cycle has repeated at least three times since January of this year; a wild goose chase. I could have resolved this sooner, but I needed to finish my final semester in school.

I have spent many hours on the phone with claims, with most calls averaging over 2 hours. I know they want me to give up, but I sense there is a solution I've yet to find.

For information how you can help with being green, please visit https://www.epa.gov/sustainability/how-can-i-help-sustainability","FORT BRAGG, NC – Sometimes being green is a good thing! Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) proudly marks its seventh consecutive year as the leading facility in Single-Use Device (SUD) reprocessing within the Department of Defense/Defense Health Agency and celebrates a decade of receiving the Stryker Sustainability Solutions Environmental Excellence Healthy Hospital Award.

Brandy Mitchell, Directorate of Logistics Clinical Analyst and SUD Reprocessing Manager at Womack, said the ‘green curve’ at Womack continues its trajectory upward. “Womack is honored to be recognized for our outstanding efforts in reprocessing single-use medical devices,” she noted. “This recognition highlights WAMC's commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, which has resulted in significant cost savings and waste reduction.”

In 2024, the facility achieved significant cost savings of $933,023 including $896,123 through collaboration with Stryker Sustainability and an additional $36,900 via Cardinal Health reprocessing—while diverting more than 51,000 devices, which translates to almost 15,000 pounds of waste from local landfills.

“The dedication of leadership at all levels across our Womack departments and clinics plays a vital role in the successful implementation and sustainability of the reprocessing program,” said Col. Stephanie Mont, Commander of Womack Army Medical Center. “Their continued emphasis enables our team to maximize our resources and reduce waste.”

Since the inception of the Reprocessing Program in 2008, Womack has saved $9 million and successfully reduced over 140,000 pounds of medical waste. The innovation of reprocessed medical devices has become a hallmark of healthcare efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Reusing SUDs not only mitigates waste but also strengthens the supply chain by retaining resources locally, thereby reducing reliance on imported products and the materials required for their production.

Lt. Col. Cynthia Styner, Logistics Registered Nurse Liaison at Womack, said the operating rooms at Womack have a strong history of sustainability excellence. “Partnered with Stryker, numerous devices such as sequential compression device sleeves, pulse oximeter sensors, electrode leads and cables, trocars, harmonics, ligasures, tourniquet cuffs and ultrasonic scalpels are recycled and redesigned ,aligning with the overall impact of cost savings and waste diverted from landfills,” she said.

Womack has even purchased a device used for soft tissue incisions when bleeding control and minimal thermal injury are desired. The instrument can be used as a substitute for electrosurgery, lasers, and steel scalpels. By the Operating Room purchasing one reprocessed handpiece device, it minimized carbon dioxide emissions by 889.29 kg. This reduction is comparable to the emissions from traveling over 1,000 miles, consuming 45 gallons of gasoline, charging 50,000 smartphones, or reducing a hospital stay by nine days in an acute care unit or three days in the ICU, as well as switching 15 incandescent bulbs to LED.

Through its partnership with the Products for the Planet program, Stryker Sustainability has facilitated the planting of numerous kelp pounds and 59 trees on behalf of Womack in environmentally critical areas, reflecting Womack’s commitment to sustainability. Womack encourages efforts in placing used products in designated reprocessing containers; your contributions are essential for protecting our oceans and forests.

Valeria Sena-Weltin, a regulatory affairs scientist at ORA, uses the analogy of a smart watch to describe how the risk-based credibility assessment works.
As the use of AI in military medicine R&D increases, researchers need to take precautions to ensure the resulting products are safe and effective, says Sena-Weltin.
Frempong and Sena-Weltin discussed the use of AI to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biological products during a recent presentation to DHA R&D-MRDC staff.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – As drug developers rely increasingly on artificial intelligence to assist with the discovery, testing and manufacture of new medicines, researchers at the Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command are learning how to apply the latest regulatory guidance related to AI to better carry out their mission to develop life-saving medicines that protect our Warfighters and enable them to maintain operational effectiveness even in chemically and biologically contaminated environments.

“The use of AI in the drug product life cycle continues to increase,” says Dr. Barima Frempong, a regulatory affairs analyst at the Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command’s Office of Regulated Activities. “AI is transforming how drug development is conducted by accelerating discovery, improving accuracy and reducing costs.”

ORA plays a vital role in each of DHA R&D-MRDC’s strategic lines of effort to tightly integrate medical research and development with the DOD’s Warfighter requirements. The office’s regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals specialize in identifying and mitigating regulatory risks early in a product’s development life cycle, which helps them pass more smoothly – and quickly – through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s rigorous review process and get approved for licensing and manufacture.

Until recently, AI has mostly been used to accelerate the process of discovering promising new drug candidates, thanks to its ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. However, drug developers are increasingly using AI to assist with other data-intensive tasks such as assisting with patient diagnosis, improving the fidelity of augmented reality and imaging systems, and informing treatment decisions. To help provide meaningful guidance for these and other emerging uses of AI, the FDA is developing regulatory frameworks and policies to ensure AI is used safely and ethically.

In January, the FDA issued a new draft guidance document, “Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products,” which lays out a seven-step method for assessing an AI model’s ability to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and quality of a new drug. The new approach lays out a risk-based assessment process that determines how an AI model will impact the regulatory decision-making and documentation requirements associated with a particular project.

Valeria Sena-Weltin, a regulatory affairs scientist at ORA, uses the analogy of a smart watch to describe how the risk-based credibility assessment works.

“The regulations that apply to a smart watch that can track your heart rate will be different than for a watch that can detect atrial fibrillation, because that watch would be considered a medical device,” says Sena-Weltin. “The more power you give to an AI model for decision making, the greater the documentation requirement will be to support its safe use.”

DHA R&D-MRDC researchers who develop vaccines, therapeutics, and devices for detecting and combating infectious diseases, biological agents and chemical weapons are increasingly incorporating AI into their new products. For example, the Automated Processing of the Physiological Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity Hemorrhage Risk Index, which uses vital-sign data from trauma patients to assess their risk of hemorrhage, and SeptiBurnAlert, which identifies whether burn patients are at risk of experiencing life-threatening complications from sepsis, both use AI to help clinicians and first responders make timely and life-saving health care decisions.

As the use of AI in military medicine R&D increases, researchers need to take precautions to ensure the resulting products are safe and effective, says Sena-Weltin. To avoid the introduction of bias that could skew the accuracy of a readout, researchers need to ensure the data sets used to train the algorithm are reliable, accurate, and complete. Because AI relies on complex computational and statistical methodologies, researchers must provide the FDA with detailed and transparent explanations of the methods they use to train the algorithm, so that they can be independently verified. And to ensure the data sets remain trustworthy over time, they should be monitored and evaluated regularly throughout its life cycle, especially after they are put into use and new data are added over time.

Frempong and Sena-Weltin discussed the use of AI to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biological products during a recent presentation to DHA R&D-MRDC staff. The presentation, which was a follow-up to ORA’s previous session on the use of AI in drug development, was part of a series of bimonthly “lunch and learn” sessions conducted by ORA for MRDC staff as a way to share the latest regulatory guidelines from the FDA related to drugs, biologics, and medical devices, and how they apply to medical research and development efforts at MRDC.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/04/23/375dfac4/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-23 19:56:31.735919

Weeks Marine secured a £15.18 million ($20 million) contract for maintenance dredging in Mobile, Alabama.
Meanwhile, the Air Force granted a £14.04 million ($18.5 million) logistics support contract modification to Newbegin Enterprises.
DARPA also exercised an £6.07 million ($8 million) contract option with Northrop Grumman for laser technology development.","Continuing its campaign to eliminate what it calls 'unnecessary spending', the Pentagon has terminated contracts worth a staggering £3.87 billion ($5.1 billion), redirecting funds towards healthcare for military personnel and their families.

A statement from the Department of Defense outlined the major contracts being eliminated as part of the cost-saving overhaul:

A Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen and others — services the DoD claims can be performed in-house;

An Air Force contract with Accenture to resell third-party Enterprise Cloud IT services, which the DoD can already procure directly;

A Navy contract for business process consulting in administrative departments;

A DARPA contract for IT helpdesk services deemed redundant due to existing internal capabilities at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).

'We need this money to spend on better healthcare for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultants. That's a lot of consulting,' said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

DEI and University Funding Also Axed

In a sweeping move, Hegseth also announced the cancellation of 11 contracts connected to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes, climate change initiatives, and lingering COVID-19 response efforts.

Additionally, the Pentagon has halted over £379.52 million ($500 million) in academic funding for two unnamed universities accused of promoting divisive DEI programmes and tolerating antisemitism. This follows a similar withdrawal of £53.13 million ($70 million) from three other institutions in recent weeks.

'We are committed to rooting out DEI — root and branch — throughout this department ... [And] I'm going to keep looking,' Hegseth said.

Strategic Shifts: New Contracts, New Priorities

Amid the cuts, the DoD has announced a slate of new military contracts, reflecting a renewed focus on core defence operations:

The Army awarded 13 firms a £189 million ($249 million) contract for architect and engineering services through 2030.

Weeks Marine secured a £15.18 million ($20 million) contract for maintenance dredging in Mobile, Alabama.

The Defense Logistics Agency granted:

£51.54 million ($67.9 million) to National Industries for the Blind for uniform supply;

£11.39 million ($15 million) to Thermocontrol for aircraft thermocouple harnesses;

An extended £11.08 million ($14.6 million) contract to Bell Textron for aircraft support.

The Navy awarded:

£40.99 million ($54 million) to General Dynamics for submarine maintenance;

£37.57 million ($49.5 million) for weapons containers;

£19.43 million ($25.6 million) for ship support services in Virginia;

£12.4 million to Alabama Shipyard for shipyard availability;

£8.05 million ($10.6 million) to Austal USA for ship maintenance.

Meanwhile, the Air Force granted a £14.04 million ($18.5 million) logistics support contract modification to Newbegin Enterprises. DARPA also exercised an £6.07 million ($8 million) contract option with Northrop Grumman for laser technology development.

Why It Matters

The Pentagon's recent spending cuts highlight a sharp pivot towards strengthening frontline defence capabilities. By slashing spending on DEI, climate response, and other programmes deemed non-essential, defence leaders are making clear that military readiness and modernisation are now top priorities.

For contractors and institutions reliant on the now-cancelled programmes, the impact could be significant — ranging from financial losses to long-term reductions in influence within the defence sector.

This strategic redirection marks a turning point in how the Department of Defense approaches budgeting, accountability, and what it considers mission-critical in a rapidly evolving global threat landscape.",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1716621/united-states-pentagon.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-23 17:56:20.604071

""The most fundamental aspect of leadership is presence; leaders have to be present to lead,"" Oates said.","JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Brooke Army Medical Center celebrated March 20 with a ceremony in the hospital's 4th floor auditorium.

""Today is dedicated for women who have made significant contributions throughout history,"" said Army Col. Michael Wirt, BAMC deputy commanding officer, highlighting this year's theme, Visionary Women: Champions of Peace and Nonviolence, which recognizes and honors women who have led efforts to end war, violence, and injustice and pioneered the use of nonviolence to change society.

""This theme is very close to home for many of us who are military members, and particularly those who are members of the medical profession,"" Wirt said. ""There is a rich history of women leading in both the U.S. military and in military medicine. For example, Lt. Gen. Patricia Horoho, who became the first woman and the first nurse to serve as the Army Surgeon General and as you all know, she was followed by our current Army Surgeon General, Lt. Gen. Nadja West.""

Wirt introduced Air Force Col. Deedra Zabokrtsky, chief of Officer Force Development Division and Director of Air Force Nursing Services at Headquarters Air Force, Office of the Surgeon General, saying she is ""an exceptional example of a visionary woman.""

Zabokrtsky who is responsible for executing officer force development initiatives and establishing training policy for the Air Force Medical Service, stepped in as the guest speaker when Air Force Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Dorothy Hogg was unable to attend because her plane was delayed.

""Flexibility is the key to air power, and that's exactly what we have today,"" she joked.

Zabokrtsky began by talking about her upbringing in Washington State and the lessons she learned rooting for the local football team.

""I'm fueled by faith and family, but I'm shaped by the little town that I grew up in,"" she said. ""I learned a lot of important lessons there. One of the best lessons I have learned is that you try hard, you play hard, every single day because every now and then, heart beats talent.""

Zabokrtsky focused her remarks on topics that apply to everyone including ""thinking globally, but acting locally"" and the importance of developing ""soft skills.""

""In order to succeed you need to think globally, but you need to act locally,"" she said. ""That resonates with everything we are doing today.

""Soft skills are hard, because we don't always value them,"" Zabokrtsky said. ""Those soft skills have a huge impact on our work environment.""

She spoke about the importance of connecting with one another and retaining skilled people within the military health system.

""Leadership is the number one factor in whether or not an employee or staff member perceives a civil work environment versus an uncivil work environment,"" Zabokrtsky said. ""Joy in work matters. Words matter and actions matter more.""

She encouraged collaboration and involving all the members of the team.

""Those are all actions that we can take locally to have a profound impact on the future of the military health system,"" she concluded. ""If you are getting anything from my remarks today, I hope you are getting that this is not a woman thing, this is a human thing.""

BAMC Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Oates closed the ceremony by thanking everyone for their participation. He also cited examples of exceptional women leaders.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 21, 2025

TRICARE Authorizes Temporary Prescription Refill Waivers for 4 Iowa Counties due to Severe Storms

FALLS CHURCH, Va. – The Defense Health Agency has announced that TRICARE beneficiaries in four Iowa counties may receive emergency prescription refills now through May 1, due to severe storms.

The counties affected are Buena Vista, Fremont, Page, and Plymouth.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Zynex, headquartered in Englewood, CO, is a medical device company that makes electrotherapy devices for pain management and rehabilitation.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" which claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported Q4 and full-year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare [health insurance program for the U.S. military] has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in securities class action litigation since its founding in 1970. Berger Montague has represented individual and institutional investors for over five decades and serves as lead counsel in courts throughout the United States.

Orsega's visit underscores the DOD’s and the Military Health System's focus on the Indo-Pacific region and commitment to ensuring and improving access to health care for active duty service members, family members, and DOD civilian employees.
In her role, Orsega oversees the DOD’s medical efforts in Japan, continuing work that began in January 2023 to address access to care challenges.
She chairs a monthly meeting of MHS and DOD components to discuss current initiatives, including emergency services, behavioral health, civilian access to care, and communications campaigns.
“Through continued dialogue between Pentagon leadership, frontline providers, and the total force in Japan, the DOD aims to develop tailored solutions to address the distinct challenges of delivering military health care in Japan while maintaining the highest standards of care for service members, their families, and DOD civilian employees,” she said.","Susan Orsega, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, visited military installations in Japan, April 7-11, 2025, to better understand challenges and successes to accessing health care in the region.

Orsega met with military hospital and clinic leaders at Misawa Air Base and Commander, Fleet Activities Yokosuka on mainland Japan and at Camp Foster on the island of Okinawa. Staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs also held listening sessions with Department of Defense civilian employees who are enrolled in the new Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement for DOD Civilian Employees in Japan as part of the pilot's evaluation.

Orsega's visit underscores the DOD’s and the Military Health System's focus on the Indo-Pacific region and commitment to ensuring and improving access to health care for active duty service members, family members, and DOD civilian employees. It also reflects the focus of Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to directly engage with military hospital and clinic staff to understand local challenges and successes.

""When Dr. Ferrara came on board, he gave us clear directives: He challenged us to immerse ourselves in the problems you face daily, especially given the unique complexities of this remote base,"" Orsega shared with military hospital and clinic staff at Misawa’s 35th Medical Group. ""He wanted us to understand your realities, roll up our sleeves, and work collaboratively to make your roles more effective, more efficient, and ultimately, more successful at serving our beneficiaries.""

During staff and leadership engagements, medical personnel in Japan highlighted challenges unique to this remote region. Supply chains face lengthy logistical hurdles, with United States’ medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment requiring more lead time compared to stateside facilities. Healthcare delivery for military families relies heavily, or even solely, on the military hospitals and clinics in comparison to installations in the United States with more robust and private sector care networks that are readily accessible through TRICARE.

The readiness mission remains top of mind for all healthcare personnel in Japan, given the region's strategic importance.

As Orsega emphasized during her visits, ""Ensuring that we're supporting our warfighters is a critical component of the Military Health System's mission, alongside sustaining clinical skills and supporting military families.”

This readiness focus takes on heightened significance in the Indo-Pacific region, where military hospitals and clinics operate on the frontline of potential conflict zones.

Despite these challenges, leadership across the MHS in Japan demonstrates “remarkable innovation and collaboration,” Orsega said.

Military hospitals and clinics have successfully built relationships with host nation healthcare systems, overcoming difficult language barriers and different medical practices. Leadership teams work across services, with U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army medical personnel collaborating to provide seamless care, as evidenced by partnerships like the joint neonatal intensive care unit operations and related evacuations between U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa and the U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka.

U.S. Navy Capt. Kathleen Cooperman, commanding officer at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, highlighted how staff have remained mission-focused through numerous transitions, including, ""staffing challenges, systems upgrades, changes to financial systems, mergers of dental corps,"" and various inspections. ""Not once did any one of these individuals lose sight of why we're here and what we need to do,"" she emphasized.

A team from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, led by the Chief of Staff Dr. Bryce Slinger, hosted six listening sessions with DOD civilian employees to inform an evaluation of the Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement. The services under this pilot began on Jan. 1, 2025, in response to DOD civilian employees' challenges in navigating the host-nation’s healthcare system. The pilot assists eligible DOD civilian employees with healthcare navigation, including provider-finder services, direct billing agreements, and insurance reimbursement.

The team received positive feedback, though civilians noted gaps in some specialty services, family coverage, and translation services. Based on these qualitative findings, paired with quantitative analysis, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness will determine if the pilot will be extended past the current period of performance, ending on Sept. 29, 2025, and will consider additional solutions to bolster civilian care options.

In her role, Orsega oversees the DOD’s medical efforts in Japan, continuing work that began in January 2023 to address access to care challenges. She chairs a monthly meeting of MHS and DOD components to discuss current initiatives, including emergency services, behavioral health, civilian access to care, and communications campaigns.

Jimmie Mathews will serve 42 months, followed by three years of supervised release, with a restitution payment of $632,026.43.
The sentences aim to serve as a deterrent, signaling that health care fraud is not to be tolerated and will result in serious consequences.","A group of three individuals from the Lawton area, involved in a health care fraud scheme, have been handed down sentences to serve more than 12 years in federal prison, collectively. As reported by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Oklahoma in a recent press release, the trio was involved in defrauding TRICARE, the military health care program, for services that were not rendered, amounting to ill-gotten gains close to $3 million.

Jimmie Mathews, 41, and Nathan Mathews, 42, along with Amber Delger, 55, were implicated in a fraudulent billing operation dating back to 2016. Emerald Lane Therapy Services and Stars & Stripes Therapy, both owned by the Mathews brothers, billed TRICARE for multiple appointments that beneficiaries did not attend—sometimes months in advance. This scheme was revealed to have billed more than $7 million to the health program.

As stated in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Oklahoma press release, U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester emphasized the gravity of exploiting such critical programs: ""These defendants exploited programs intended to provide critical benefits to our nation’s military, veterans, and their families"". Troester further highlighted his commitment to protecting taxpayer-funded institutions and ensuring the integrity of funds meant for those who serve our country.

In what U.S. District Judge Jodi W. Dishman described as an ""egregious and far-reaching"" fraud, Nathan Mathews was sentenced to serve 87 months in federal prison with a subsequent two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $1,410,255.66. Jimmie Mathews will serve 42 months, followed by three years of supervised release, with a restitution payment of $632,026.43. Meanwhile, Delger received a 26-month sentence back in January of this year, with two years supervised release and restitution totaling $653,269.00.

This case is a result of vigilant investigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the United States Department of Defense, and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney D.H. Dilbeck. Actions such as these, according to Acting Special Agent in Charge Chad Gosch, are pivotal in preventing schemes that compromise the welfare of military healthcare beneficiaries and waste valuable tax dollars. The sentences aim to serve as a deterrent, signaling that health care fraud is not to be tolerated and will result in serious consequences.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/4/lawton-trio-sentenced-to-over-12-years-in-prison-for-dollar3-million-tricare-health-care-fraud-2.webp,N,0.0,2025-04-23 11:56:21.049798

In February 2025, the Defense Health Agency released a policy memorandum developed by the Sepsis Working Group.
The department's Defense Health Agency coordinates the delivery of these health services, in part through care provided at agency-operated military medical treatment facilities.
This report describes admissions involving sepsis at military medical treatment facilities and sepsis management efforts within the Defense Health Agency, including what entities focus on sepsis, what information is tracked, and selected military medical treatment facility experiences with sepsis diagnosis and treatment.
GAO also reviewed information on sepsis-related quality measures tracked by the Defense Health Agency and facilities' performance on these measures.","This Q&A report examines sepsis at Department of Defense-run medical facilities. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an extreme response to an infection. It is a leading cause of hospital admissions and deaths.

Sepsis cases accounted for about 1% of admissions at DOD medical facilities in FYs 2017-2023.

DOD tracks 4 measures of medical facility quality related to sepsis. Military facilities generally met or beat the benchmark rates for these measures in calendar year 2023.

DOD established a sepsis strategy in February 2025 that includes monitoring facility performance on these measures.

What GAO Found

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an extreme response to an infection in the body and typically requires hospital care. GAO's analysis of Defense Health Agency data indicates that the number of inpatient admissions at military medical treatment facilities that involved sepsis was relatively consistent from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2023. These admissions accounted for more than 15,000 (about 1 percent) of the almost 1.3 million total inpatient admissions for this 7-year period. Further, for 86 percent of the admissions involving sepsis, the condition was present when the patient was admitted.

The Defense Health Agency formed a Sepsis Working Group in 2021 to standardize efforts related to sepsis detection, diagnosis, and treatment across military medical treatment facilities. In February 2025, the Defense Health Agency released a policy memorandum developed by the Sepsis Working Group. This memorandum establishes a sepsis strategy in the military medical treatment facilities, referencing national standards and guidelines, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Hospital Sepsis Program Core Elements and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.

The Defense Health Agency tracks information on four sepsis-related quality measures. For these measures, military medical treatment facilities generally performed comparable to, or better than, the benchmark rates for all hospitals applicable to calendar year 2023. For example, military medical treatment facilities performed comparable to, or better than, the benchmark rates for all hospitals for measures pertaining to patients receiving appropriate care for sepsis in hospital settings, the death rate among surgical inpatients with sepsis as a serious treatable complication, and the rate of postoperative sepsis. Staff GAO interviewed at selected military medical treatment facilities did not report experiencing any major challenges specific to sepsis diagnosis and treatment.

Why GAO Did This Study

The Department of Defense is responsible for providing health care to approximately 9.4 million beneficiaries, including care that could involve the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. The department's Defense Health Agency coordinates the delivery of these health services, in part through care provided at agency-operated military medical treatment facilities.

The House Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 includes a provision for GAO to report on various issues related to sepsis within the Department of Defense. This report describes admissions involving sepsis at military medical treatment facilities and sepsis management efforts within the Defense Health Agency, including what entities focus on sepsis, what information is tracked, and selected military medical treatment facility experiences with sepsis diagnosis and treatment.

To conduct this work, GAO analyzed Defense Health Agency data on inpatient admissions involving sepsis at military medical treatment facilities from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2023—the most recent data available. GAO also reviewed information on sepsis-related quality measures tracked by the Defense Health Agency and facilities' performance on these measures. GAO interviewed and obtained information from Defense Health Agency officials and staff from selected military medical treatment facilities, which were selected for variation in the number of sepsis cases treated, inpatient bed capacity, affiliated service branch, and geography.

What Is the Problem

The TRICARE West region is experiencing issues with delays in reimbursement after transitioning to a new contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, which took over from Health Net Federal Services on January 1, 2025.

""As a prescriber who plays ""beat the insurance company"" on a daily basis, here's my best advice: do not claim that it is not working. Have unmanageable side effects instead. In the medical world, effectiveness is a matter of professional opinion, which your insurer will feel they can debate. Side effects, on the other hand, are solely within the interpretation of the patient. Once negative side effects are reported -- that's it. An insurer cannot compel you to continue to take a drug that causes stomach pain, nausea so severe that you miss work, light-headedness that makes it dangerous to drive, etc. Wegovy is documented to have more difficult side effects than Zepbound. Do a search and see what your possible Wegovy side effects might be. It is unlikely that you would have none of them."" https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1k4fee8/comment/mo9mvts/?context=3

Bone stress injuries, which include stress fractures, can be debilitating to athletes but are also a problem for the U.S. military, according to public health experts.

“Service members who develop BSIs may be placed on a medical profile limiting duty or training activities, or even need orthopedic surgery,” says U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, a physical therapist and chief of the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Injury Prevention Branch at Aberdeen, Maryland. “By finding ways to prevent and reduce the number and severity of BSIs, the military can improve force readiness, lethality, and reduce costs.”

In pursuit of this goal, experts from the DHA-PH have been studying trends and risk factors of BSI with scientists at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and military leaders at the U.S. Army Training Center at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, an initial entry training installation for nearly half of the U.S. Army.

These scientists now have a better understanding of some factors that may increase the risk of service members’ developing a BSI.

What are bone stress injuries?

A BSI is a type of musculoskeletal overuse injury resulting from gradual, repetitive force on bone tissues. Common activities in the military that cause these injuries are running, marching, and load-bearing exercises. MSK overuse injuries continue to be a primary reason for service members’ medical visits and cost the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“While a gradual increase of exercise and physical activity will encourage bone and other supporting musculoskeletal tissues to strengthen over time, a BSI happens when the bone tissue doesn’t have enough time to build between activities,” says Katelyn Guerriere-Aaron, a senior research physiologist at USARIEM.

DHA-PH injury experts agree.

Lopez explains that BSIs may be missed during an initial medical exam. BSIs may take time to develop, are confused with other types of injuries, or are painless until becoming severe. Catching early signs of BSIs is also difficult with motivated military personnel, who want to ‘tough out’ physical training programs for fear of restarting (known as being “recycled”) or failing military training due to injury.

“Data show most BSIs in the military are to the lower parts of the body. This includes areas extending from the hip down to the toes,” says Ryan Steelman, a DHA-PH injury prevention epidemiologist. “BSIs to the tibia, which includes a condition sometimes referred to as shin splints, are especially common among men. Women more often experience BSI to the hip or the femoral neck, an upper portion of the thigh bone.”

Diagnosing BSI injuries can be challenging, even by doctors.

“BSIs, particularly hips, can be tricky to diagnose as the pain level doesn’t always equal the severity level, and X-ray imaging doesn’t always show early BSI,” says U.S. Army Maj. Gary Helton, assistant chief of the Fort Jackson Department of Sports Medicine. “Tibial BSIs, and hip BSIs, particularly the femoral neck, can lead to a complete fracture needing surgery if not addressed in a timely manner.”

Evidence indicates extensive running and long road marches with heavy rucksacks – especially on consecutive days – are associated with military lower-body MSK injuries like these BSIs.

“These training activities, however, are critical to ensuring personnel are ready for the physical rigors of combat operations,” says Steelman. “By studying BSI trends and risk factors, we are better able to help identify ways to reduce BSI impacts and build more resilient warfighters.”

Who is at risk?

New military recruits are particularly at risk of BSIs because their initial entry training, typically 10 to 16 weeks, often brings a sudden and substantial increase in the amount and intensity of their physical activity. DHA data show that while female service members have a higher risk of BSI, there are almost five times more male service members, so more men than women will develop a BSI.

“We have been diagnosing BSIs in recruits at Fort Jackson for years. A large number of these BSIs are diagnosed as early as the second and third week of training,” says Helton. “The treatment for these BSIs detracts from the success of the training.”

With support from DHA public health experts and USARIEM researchers, Helton has been able to objectively review BSI trends and risk factors and identify potential ways to reduce BSI severity and case numbers.

“Many recruits who are eventually injured in training lead relatively sedentary lives prior to enlistment, so they do not have the foundation necessary for the rigors of military training,” says Helton. “Preparing their bodies with physical training before volunteering for initial military training can reduce their risk of developing a BSI during initial training programs.”

While all forms of exercise before initial military entry can improve fitness, the type of physical activity may also be important.

“Our findings suggest that specific activities that require multi-directional body movement, such as soccer or basketball, may lower rates of BSI more than exercises like running or lifting by helping build stronger overall MSK structure,” says Julie Hughes, a senior researcher and colleague of Guerriere-Aaron at USARIEM.

What risk factors can be controlled?

USARIEM experts have highlighted an especially critical finding that could help reduce the risk of BSI.

“Several studies have pointed to excessive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, during rigorous physical training activities as a factor that will increase BSI risk,” says Guerriere-Aaron. “NSAIDS have also been found to delay healing in those who do have a bone stress injury.”

Hughes agrees that use of NSAIDs, which include products that can be purchased over the counter, such as ibuprofen, may be one of the most significant and preventable risks of BSI.

“Our ongoing studies are finding that NSAIDS may increase BSI risk as much as five times during initial military entry training,” she says.

Many orthopedic doctors are aware that NSAIDs delay healing, but this may not be well known by others in the medical field, says Helton.

“Since NSAIDs can be effective for pain management, many providers may prescribe NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen, for pain,” he says. “But if pain is the result of potential bone injury, research suggests NSAIDS should be avoided.”

Helton points out that recruits in military initial entry training are dependent on military medical providers for any form of medication and typically cannot purchase over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen.

“We are working to ensure military providers are aware of the NSAID risks with bone injuries. This is a key message we want to get out,” he says. “We also discourage NSAID use by recruits who may be able to access NSAIDs over the counter or from a buddy.”

Past evidence has also indicated that low bone density is a risk factor for BSI among young women who have other risk factors. Key underlying risks include poor nutrition and/or being underweight, and excessive exercise. Recent evidence suggests similar risks among young adults of both genders may contribute to low bone density and thus increase BSI risk.

Another consideration Helton observed is the added stress on recruits’ lower body bones during running or ruck march formations if drill sergeants tell recruits to ‘stride it out’, particularly shorter trainees.

“There appears to be more bone stress if a trainee has to change their normal gait and stretch their legs forward to keep up with formation, landing harder on the heel and increasing stress at the hip,” Helton says. “Quicker, shorter steps may be safer, or – even better – putting shorter persons up front in a formation to manage the pace.”

What can be done by service members?

An estimated one-third of applicants to military entry training don’t meet basic military fitness standards. Recruits who are more physically fit before their initial training program have lower BSI rates. Other underlying factors, such as poor diet and lack of sleep, may make some service members more vulnerable to developing a BSI than others.

Lopez recommends that before military initial training, recruits should:

- Gradually increase various exercising drills to include agility, power and balance training along with more traditional aerobic endurance (cardio) and strength exercises.

- Allow time between exercise sessions for rest and bone recovery.

During training, recruits should:

- Avoid NSAIDS for bone pain.

- Eat nutritional foods to maintain energy levels.

- Prioritize sleep to allow for bone recovery.

- Avoid overreaching gaits and striding out; aim for shorter quick steps.

- Seek medical assessment at the earliest signs of bone pain and follow recovery treatment plans to avoid more serious BSIs.

By reducing BSI rates and severity during initial training, the military can improve the readiness and resilience of its fighting force.

OKLAHOMA CITY – JIMMIE MATHEWS, 41, NATHAN MATHEWS, 42, and AMBER DELGER, 55, all of the Lawton area, have been sentenced for their roles in a conspiracy to commit health care fraud, announced U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester.

The defendants were each charged in May 2024, with Delger being charged by Information with conspiring to commit health care fraud, and both Jimmie and Nathan charged by a 16-count federal grand jury Indictment with conspiring to commit health care fraud and fifteen counts of health care fraud. Beginning in 2016, Nathan owned Emerald Lane Therapy Services (Emerald Lane) in Lawton, a massage therapy provider. Delger was a subsequent co-owner of the company. Nathan and Jimmie also owned a separate massage therapy provider, Stars & Stripes Therapy (Stars & Stripes), which opened its doors in Lawton in January 2020. Both businesses purportedly treated TRICARE beneficiaries, submitted claims to the Defense Health Agency (DHA), and received payments from DHA for those services.

According to public record, beginning in January 2018, the defendants conspired together to submit false and fraudulent claims to TRICARE for services that were never rendered. Court documents allege that after TRICARE beneficiaries visited either of the businesses, the defendants would schedule multiple appointments for the beneficiaries many months in advance. If the beneficiary couldn’t make the appointments, or stopped coming altogether, the defendants would nonetheless continue to bill TRICARE as if the beneficiaries had received care. Additionally, Emerald Lane billed TRICARE using the National Provider Identity (NPI) number of an occupational therapist long after the therapist had stopped working for the business. In total, Emerald Lane and Stars & Stripes billed more than $7 million to TRICARE and received nearly $3 million in reimbursement.

In October 2024, Jimmie and Nathan pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit health care fraud. Previously, on June 17, 2024, Delger pleaded guilty to the same.

“Through their fraudulent conduct, these defendants exploited programs intended to provide critical benefits to our nation’s military, veterans, and their families” said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester. “Through vigorous investigation and prosecution, we will continue to protect taxpayer funded institutions and ensure that TRICARE dollars are protected and properly allocated to help those who serve.”

“The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) is committed to ensuring TRICARE, the U.S. Military healthcare program, is not subjected to fraudulent schemes that expose beneficiaries to harm and waste valuable tax dollars,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Chad Gosch of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, DCIS Southwest Field Office. “These sentencings demonstrate our tireless pursuit to investigate individuals that seek to enrich themselves at the expense of this valuable program.”

Last week, U.S. District Judge Jodi W. Dishman sentenced both Nathan and Jimmie. Nathan was sentenced to serve 87 months in federal prison, followed by two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $1,410,255.66 in restitution. Jimmie was sentenced to serve 42 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $632,026.43 in restitution. Delger was previously sentenced on January 31, 2025, to serve 26 months in federal prison, followed by two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $653,269.00. In announcing the sentences, Judge Dishman described the fraud scheme as egregious and far reaching in its scope, duration, and impact. Judge Dishman further noted that the public needs to know that health care fraud is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and will result in prosecution and punishment.

This case is the result of an investigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the United States Department of Defense. Assistant U.S. Attorney D.H. Dilbeck prosecuted the case.

The Child and Family Behavioral Health Services team at BJACH provides targeted support to help children and Families manage the unique challenges of military life—frequent moves, parental deployments and long separations.

“Our team delivers counseling, coping strategies and crisis intervention to help children build emotional strength and stability,” said Marguerite Wilcox, a licensed clinical social worker with the department. “We tailor care to meet each child’s needs and reinforce their support systems.”

BJACH’s behavioral health staff offers a range of services including grief counseling, skills-building, parenting support, psychological testing, and trauma-specific treatments such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, or EMDR.

Dr. Patricia Cornelius, deputy director of psychological health, said supporting military children starts with understanding the emotional strain of transitions and disrupted relationships.

“Resilience helps them bounce back from adversity and adapt to change,” she said. “Mental health care gives children the tools to cope and succeed.”

For children who may be experiencing behavioral or developmental concerns, early intervention is key, said Pfc. Dice Marchioni, a behavioral health specialist at BJACH.

“We guide Families through what care looks like, help them access resources and ensure they understand the support available,” Marchioni said.

According to Psychology Technician Angela Kuesters, military children also benefit from learning to regulate their emotions, develop problem-solving skills and connect with peers facing similar circumstances.

“Building community matters,” she said. “Mental health care plays a fundamental role in creating that support and helping children grow.”

Dr. Ruth Graupera-Frain, a psychiatrist with the team, emphasized the long-term benefits of mental health support.

“Our brains run the show,” she said. “Military children deal with complex emotions early on. Providing consistent care improves their academic, social and emotional development well into adulthood.”

Lt. Col. Alexander Ragan, BJACH’s assistant director of medical affairs and the director of psychological health at Fort Johnson, said these services don’t just support the child—they strengthen the whole force.

“When we take care of military Families, we reinforce readiness,” Ragan said. “Military children make sacrifices too. Supporting their mental health ensures their resilience and helps prepare the next generation of Soldiers.”

BJACH’s behavioral health team remains committed to the mission of improving Family readiness and supporting the military community through expert, compassionate care.

“Strong Families create strong Soldiers,” Ragan said. “And strong Soldiers protect our nation.”

“The TRICARE For Life Handbook is your go-to resource for all things related to the Medicare and TRICARE,” said Robert Agnello, team lead, beneficiary web and publications, for the Defense Health Agency. “The handbook is your guide to understanding your TFL coverage.”

Here’s a closer look at what the handbook highlights.

Understanding how TFL works

Wondering what the transition to TFL will be like? The first thing you should know is that if you’re TRICARE-eligible and have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B, your transition to TFL is automatic. You don’t need to enroll.

As you make the transition, the handbook can help ease the way. The sections take you through:

• Medicare and TRICARE eligibility

• How Medicare and TFL work together

• What services are covered

• How to get care where you live and when you travel

You’ll learn how TFL works with other health insurance. The handbook also describes your dental and vision coverage options. This includes coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Remember, you have TFL when you’re TRICARE-eligible and have premium-free Medicare Part A (hospitalization insurance) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance, which has a monthly premium), regardless of age or where you live.

Be sure to check the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System to verify that all your information is up to date.

Knowing your pharmacy coverage options

Pharmacy coverage is a priority. TFL offers the same comprehensive prescription drug coverage as other TRICARE health plans, as well as the same convenient options for filling your prescriptions. You can get your prescriptions through:

• Military pharmacies

• TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

• TRICARE retail network pharmacies

• Non-network pharmacies

Note: You don’t need a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan to keep your TRICARE prescription drug coverage. With Medicare Part D, you may also pay a monthly premium, and you’ll need to follow the plan’s rules for filling prescriptions.

Learning how to get the most from Medicare and TFL

Anytime you change health plans, there’s a learning curve. With TFL, you may wonder how to:

• Find a provider

• Ensure you won’t have any out-of-pocket costs for a service

• Get care if you travel or live overseas

• Obtain a pre-authorization or referral for care

• File claims, an appeal, or a grievance

• Know the difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage

Here’s a closer look at what the handbook highlights.

Understanding how TFL works

Wondering what the transition to TFL will be like? The first thing you should know is that if you’re TRICARE-eligible and have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B, your transition to TFL is automatic. You don’t need to enroll.

As you make the transition, the handbook can help ease the way. The sections take you through:

Medicare and TRICARE eligibility

How Medicare and TFL work together

What services are covered

How to get care where you live and when you travel

You’ll learn how TFL works with other health insurance. The handbook also describes your dental and vision coverage options. This includes coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Remember, you have TFL when you’re TRICARE-eligible and have premium-free Medicare Part A (hospitalization insurance) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance, which has a monthly premium), regardless of age or where you live.

Be sure to check the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System to verify that all your information is up to date.

Knowing your pharmacy coverage options

Pharmacy coverage is a priority. TFL offers the same comprehensive prescription drug coverage as other TRICARE health plans, as well as the same convenient options for filling your prescriptions. You can get your prescriptions through:

Military pharmacies

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

TRICARE retail network pharmacies

Non-network pharmacies

Note: You don’t need a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan to keep your TRICARE prescription drug coverage. With Medicare Part D, you may also pay a monthly premium, and you’ll need to follow the plan’s rules for filling prescriptions.

Learning how to get the most from Medicare and TFL

Anytime you change health plans, there’s a learning curve. With TFL, you may wonder how to:

Find a provider

Ensure you won’t have any out-of-pocket costs for a service

Get care if you travel or live overseas

Obtain a pre-authorization or referral for care

File claims, an appeal, or a grievance

Know the difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage

Factors such as isolation from social support networks may place military beneficiaries at risk of developing perinatal mental health conditions.
This report examines the screening of TRICARE beneficiaries for perinatal mental health conditions in direct and private sector care.","What GAO Found

The Department of Defense's (DOD) Defense Health Agency (DHA) oversees the TRICARE program that provides health care to beneficiaries—active-duty service members and their dependents. Beneficiaries receive care in military medical treatment facilities (direct care) and through civilian providers, generally administered by two managed care support contractors (private sector care). This care includes addressing mental health conditions that occur during and up to 1 year after pregnancy, known as the perinatal period.

GAO estimates that 52 percent of the 6,151 service members who delivered through direct care in fiscal year 2022 received DHA's three recommended perinatal mental health screenings. These screenings used one of two DHA-recommended tools and were performed at DHA's specified time intervals. All service members were screened at least once during their perinatal period.

Estimated Percentage of Service Members Screened for Perinatal Mental Health Conditions in Direct Care, Fiscal Year 2022

Note: The percentages in the figure represent those screenings that were conducted in accordance with DHA recommendations. GAO reviewed medical records for a random sample of 291 service members with live births in direct care—in a military medical treatment facility—in fiscal year 2022 out of a total population of 6,151. Estimates in this figure have a margin of error within plus or minus 6 percent at the 95 percent confidence interval.

For TRICARE beneficiaries in private sector care, two 2022 DHA contractor reviews showed significantly lower screening rates than direct care. For example, one contractor found that 30 percent of beneficiaries were screened at least once, and about 6 percent were screened more than once.

GAO found that DHA does not monitor or direct its contractors to monitor the frequency of perinatal mental health screenings in direct or private sector care. DOD has indicated that screening is its main prevention strategy for this high-risk group. Missing screenings could result in undiagnosed and untreated perinatal mental health conditions in TRICARE beneficiaries. By routinely monitoring the frequency of screenings in direct and private sector care, and taking corrective actions as needed to ensure adherence to DHA's recommendations and evidence-based practices, DHA can help ensure that beneficiaries consistently receive high-quality care.

Why GAO Did This Study

TRICARE provides health care to about 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries. In fiscal year 2023, there were about 89,000 births among TRICARE beneficiaries. Research shows mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety are the most common complications that develop during the perinatal period. Mental health is a critical part of military readiness. Factors such as isolation from social support networks may place military beneficiaries at risk of developing perinatal mental health conditions.

A report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 includes a provision for GAO to review issues related to perinatal mental health in the military. This report examines the screening of TRICARE beneficiaries for perinatal mental health conditions in direct and private sector care.

GAO reviewed a generalizable sample of 291 service members' medical records that had a live birth in a military medical treatment facility in fiscal year 2022—the most recent year for which complete data were available. GAO reviewed DHA documents, two contractor reviews, and relevant laws. GAO also interviewed DHA officials and contractor representatives.",https://www.gao.gov/assets/extracts/efa9a09bc88bcfb026529c867e1b611b/fastfacts_107163.png,N,-1.0,2025-04-22 11:56:29.120265

Yet, even the strongest and most courageous among us sometimes need support. Especially when raising teenagers who struggle with mental health or behavioral health issues.

Military life demands frequent moves, long deployments, and constant uncertainty. Consequently, even the most resilient military families experience overwhelming stress and invisible strains.

Not surprisingly, adapting to a new home, school, and community takes a significant toll on a fragile teen’s mental health and well-being. In this article, we take a closer look at TRICARE East’s coverage for residential treatment. In addition to other benefits related to treating teen mental health.

Today’s adolescents face unique challenges and pressures unlike any previous generation. Consequently, this has led to an alarming rise in teen emotional and behavioral health issues. Adding to this, consider the intense academic pressures and the pervasive influence of social media in teens’ daily lives. It is no wonder so many are struggling with their emotional well-being.

The Surgeon General described it as a ‘mental health epidemic.” Highlighting the urgent need for more effective interventions and teen mental health treatment.

Recognizing the critical need for specialized mental health support for military teens, TRICARE East has approved Turning Winds Residential Treatment Center as a comprehensive treatment provider option. Turning Winds now accepts TRICARE East as an insurance option for military families whose teens are in need of residential care. This collaboration aims to provide a lifeline for military families seeking recovery and healing for their adolescents.

Recognizing Teen Mental Health Warning Signs: A Parent’s Guide

According to Pew Research, nearly 70% of parents believe it’s harder to be a teenager today than it was for previous generations. Parents need to recognize the warning signs that a teen may be struggling, such as:

Significant changes in mood or behavior

Withdrawing from activities once enjoyed

Sudden academic decline or discipline issues

Understanding the Unique Stressors Faced by Military Teens

While all adolescents grapple with mounting pressures, military teens face more stress, resulting from the unique stressors of military life.

Long separations from deployed parents and the high levels of uncertainty caused by the frequent moves, the distance from the extended families, and other stressors typically intensify emotional struggles and behavioral health issues.

These pressures can significantly impact a teen’s emotional health. In fact, research shows that adolescents in military-connected families are 28% more likely to experience depression symptoms and 42% more likely to report lower life satisfaction compared to their civilian peers.[1]

These findings highlight the critical importance of providing early mental health intervention and targeted support for military teens navigating the unique pressures of military life.

TRICARE East offers expanded mental health coverage to ensure military teens struggling with emotional or behavioral challenges can access professional care when they need it most.

As a result, Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs) like Turning Winds can now offer mental health services to support military families and their struggling teens.

For military families with teens in need of emotional or behavioral health treatment, Turning Winds, a teen mental health residential treatment, is a new treatment option to help their teens find a new path of recovery and healing.

Whether your teen struggles with:

anxiety

depression

co-occurring conditions

behavioral issues

PTSD

is involved in high-risk behaviors

misuses substances

has a technology or social media addiction

Turning Winds’ unique hybrid therapeutic program offers personalized treatment for teens. And, while in treatment, your teenager can continue to work on their academics, helping them to heal, catch up, or excel, so they return home ready to live their best life.

What is TRICARE East?

TRICARE East is the healthcare program offered by the Department of Defense and administered by Humana Military. TRICARE East provides coverage to military families living in the eastern United States. Vital mental and behavioral health treatment is available to families of active duty, retirees, and dependents.

While TRICARE East functions like traditional health insurance and offers access to care, it is more. Officially, it is a comprehensive healthcare program. What parents need to know is that TRICARE East covers residential treatment for your teenager, in addition to other mental health and behavioral health therapies.

TRICARE East provides coverage for both outpatient and inpatient Care. To help parents understand the differences and benefits between these treatment options, we created a comprehensive TRICARE East Care Options Comparison Chart:

Accessing Outpatient Therapy Under TRICARE East: Flexible Support

Outpatient therapy typically includes regular counseling sessions, psychiatric visits, and other supportive services while your teen continues to live at home. These services can include:

Individual therapy

Family therapy

Medication management

Group therapy sessions

Benefits of Outpatient Mental Health Care for Military Teens (TRICARE East)

Allows teens to maintain their daily routines, including school and family activities.

Provides flexibility for families who may have frequent moves or changing schedules.

Often used as a first step or a lower level of care when symptoms are moderate.

Lower cost compared to inpatient programs.

When Outpatient Therapy Isn’t Enough: Exploring TRICARE East Residential Options

May not provide enough structure for teens with severe mental health issues.

Requires a stable home environment and strong family involvement to be effective.

Progress can be slower when intensive daily support is needed.

TRICARE East Coverage for 24/7 Residential Mental Health Treatment for Teens in Crisis

Inpatient care (also referred to as residential treatment or hospitalization, depending on the level of need) provides around-the-clock support for teens who are struggling with more serious emotional, behavioral, or psychiatric issues. TRICARE East covers a range of inpatient services, including:

Psychiatric hospitalization for acute crises

Residential treatment centers (RTCs) for ongoing therapeutic care

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) as a step-down from full inpatient care

The Benefits of Intensive Residential Treatment for Teen Mental Health

Provides intensive therapy, medical supervision, and emotional support 24/7.

Removes teens from environments that may be contributing to their mental health struggles.

An excellent option for teens to develop emotional regulation and learn new skills to manage their responses.

Structured daily schedules focused on healing, skill-building, and stabilization.

Essential for teens experiencing safety risks, such as suicidal ideation or severe behavioral disturbances.

Choosing the Right TRICARE East Mental Health Option for Your Teen: Inpatient vs. Outpatient

Your child’s specific needs and the severity of their symptoms will determine the level of care they require. The important thing for parents to know is that there is a path to healing for your teen. TRICARE East offers access to both outpatient and inpatient options, ensuring a pathway to healing, hope, and recovery.

Before your child is admitted into a residential treatment center, TRICARE East requires pre-authorization. For the treatment to be authorized, it must be deemed medically necessary, and the process often involves providing comprehensive documentation from a licensed mental health professional.

What Is Considered Medically Necessary: This means the treatment must be essential for addressing the teen’s mental health condition, with clear clinical documentation supporting the need for this level of care.

Work with us to Get Pre-authorization

Step 1: We Will Verify Your Benefits. We validate available coverage and requirements. We review all financial aspects that affect treatment, including deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket maximums. These costs can vary depending on your specific plan and the type of treatment your child will receive, our goal is to help you understand exactly what TRICARE East will cover.

Step 2: Necessary Documentation. We work closely with TRICARE East to obtain clarification on the documentation required for approval of your teen’s specific needs, ensuring you have the right documentation and referrals. We also evaluate your child and submit the treatment plan.

Step 3: We Help You Streamline the Process. Our admissions team has experience working with TRICARE East. They will keep you informed on all administrative tasks required to facilitate the preauthorization approval process, including all necessary paperwork submissions.

By proactively working with you through these steps, we avoid delays and ensure your teen receives the care they need without unnecessary roadblocks.

Clinical Documentation Requirements for TRICARE East Residential Treatment

To support residential treatment claims, you’ll need evaluations from mental health professionals, treatment plans, and progress notes. These documents help demonstrate the need for residential treatment to Tricare East.

Appealing TRICARE East Denials for Teen Residential Treatment

Residential treatment claims have a higher risk of denial due to the complexities of treatment, the strict documentation requirements, and the ongoing need for preapprovals; not just at admissions but throughout treatment.

Turning Winds: Simplifying TRICARE East Billing for Teen Residential Mental Health Care

We use direct billing, which reduces your stress and anxiety. With our help to manage the claim process, we can help you navigate denials and appeal decisions.

By: Jeff Sommes

Two men who ran a New Jersey-based marketing company have been sentenced to federal prison for orchestrating a nationwide health care fraud and kickback scheme that bilked Medicare and TRICARE out of over $127 million, according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Eric Karlewicz, also known as “Anthony Mazza,” 46, of Rockland County, New York, was sentenced to 51 months in prison, while Nicco Romanowski, 33, of Roswell, Georgia, received an 80-month sentence.

The two were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.

According to federal prosecutors, from mid-2017 to mid-2019, Karlewicz and Romanowski operated Empire Pain Center Holdings LLC, a marketing company that worked with doctors, telemedicine firms, and medical equipment suppliers to submit fraudulent claims for durable medical equipment (DME) such as braces for shoulders, knees, and backs.

Using aggressive call tactics, Empire employees pressured Medicare and TRICARE recipients to accept medical equipment they often didn’t need.

The company then paid kickbacks to telemedicine firms, which in turn paid doctors to sign off on the orders—frequently without consulting patients.

The prescriptions were sent to DME suppliers, who submitted claims for reimbursement and shared a portion of the proceeds with Empire.

They include the American Medical Specialties Board as well as the AOA Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists, and specialty boards for podiatric medicine, foot and ankle, and oral and maxillofacial surgery.
An official with the agency tells the Sun that any physician who meets its standards can work at a military facility, regardless of board certification.
“Board certification is not required for any physicians hired by the military to work within our military medical treatment facilities,” the official said.
“ABMS and AOA are inherently recognized as having unique credentials with respect to board certification,” she said.","A physicians group representing about 5 percent of America’s doctors is asking Congress to break a monopoly held by its rival — the nation’s largest medical board certification group — which it charges has gained exclusive control over military and veterans hospitals, shutting out qualified physicians with needed specialty skills.

The American Board of Physician Specialists certifies doctors in 25 fields, including familiar practices such as anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, family practice, and obstetrics and gynecology, as well as distinct specialties like integrative medicine and pain management. The group’s CEO, Jeff Morris, says that uniquely skilled doctors are being ignored by the military because of a sweetheart arrangement with the American Board of Medical Specialties, which represents more than 900,000 doctors nationwide. He contends the deal is driving up costs, reducing innovation, and denying access to care.

“Reaching medical readiness is important,“ Mr. Morris tells the Sun. “If you have just one entity controlling that, you no longer have a difference of thought. So then what happens to innovation in medicine?”

The National Defense Authorization Act recognizes credentials from five boards. They include the American Medical Specialties Board as well as the AOA Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists, and specialty boards for podiatric medicine, foot and ankle, and oral and maxillofacial surgery. The act lists qualifications that other boards must meet to become credentialed with the military’s medical care provider, the Defense Health Agency.

An official with the agency tells the Sun that any physician who meets its standards can work at a military facility, regardless of board certification.

“Board certification is not required for any physicians hired by the military to work within our military medical treatment facilities,” the official said. “Our physicians need to have an appropriate license and applicable degree from an accredited institution, along with appropriate post-graduate training certificates for their specialty such as internship residency or fellowship, and evidence of current clinical competency, but board certifications are not required for hiring or for retention.”

While board certification is said to be optional, without it, doctors don’t get hired, Mr. Morris asserted, claiming that the military’s hiring authorities are members of the pre-eminent boards. One emergency medicine doctor with the military added that doctors can only earn the annual incentive pay bonus for certification if they are certified by a credentialed board.

“In terms of practicing in the military, it’s a pay issue because you have a pay incentive if you are board certified through an organization that is recognized by the military,” the doctor, who has been working as a reservist for more than three decades, tells the Sun. “Your board certification was not recognized unless it was through the ABMS.”

The Defense Health Agency official did not provide the number of physicians who operate without board certification or the percentage of certified physicians who are certified by the medical specialties board.

Founded by the American Medical Association in the 1930s in an effort for physicians to assert their medical expertise, the American Medical Specialties Board represents 95 percent of America’s doctors and offers certification by 24 boards in 136 subspecialties.

The organization’s associate vice president for communications, Susan C. Morris, tells the Sun that her organization had no role in determining which boards were recognized in the defense bill, “whether by name or through the standards.” She added that the defense authorization act mirrors the American Medical Association’s standards policy.

“ABMS and AOA are inherently recognized as having unique credentials with respect to board certification,” she said. “The high quality and rigor of the ABMS member boards’ certification programs lead to better care and outcomes for patients.”

Mr. Morris predicts that without recognition of other boards, lack of innovation and increasing costs will only get worse. Last month, Republicans on the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee wrote several residency programs and accreditation councils asking whether hiring practices suppress doctors’ mobility and pay and contribute to doctor shortages.

The medical residency antitrust exemption passed by Congress in 2004 “has distorted the American medical residency market, undermining free market principles to the detriment of the nation’s doctors and the patients who rely on them,” wrote House Ways and Means’ antitrust subcommittee chairman, Scott Fitzgerald.

Among the letter’s recipients was the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, which was co-founded by the American Medical Specialities Board and is funded by American taxpayers to the tune of $15 billion per year.

“Now you have two entities that work together to control physicians and how medicine is taught completely,” Mr. Morris said.

Ms. Morris disputed claims that her board plays a role in the governance of the accreditation council, but acknowledged that some member boards “have programs to help educate residents about the board certification process for that specialty or subspecialty.”

The federation representing state medical licensing authorities also notes that board certification is voluntary, but “other practical considerations — such as obtaining hospital privileges — lead most physicians to obtain specialty certification.”

At least seven licensing authorities — in Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee Medical, Virginia, Wyoming — give preferential treatment to candidates certified by the American Medical Specialties Board. These preferences include allowing physician candidates additional time to obtain a medical license, lowering post-graduate training requirements, and increasing the number of exam attempts a physician can take.

This preference system is just another example of how a stranglehold on board recognition lowers standards without improving care, Mr. Morris said, noting that military members, including Special Forces being deployed with a medic, are disadvantaged as a result.

“There are a lot of boards that don’t even exist yet because medicine is constantly changing,” he said. “These certifying bodies should be able to present themselves, and the Defense Health Agency looks and says, you meet the standard, you’re accepted.”",https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ear-nose-and-throat-doctors-on-ship.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive,N,0.0,2025-04-22 06:56:33.737020

From service cancellations to mounting debt, they're fighting for accountability after a change from TRICARE's east to west region.

That change has left a trail of frustrations for Texas families and providers.

""There just needs to be accountability,"" said active military spouse Rebecca Brown. ""Somebody, somewhere within the 'Triwest' system knows what is going on and what needs to be fixed.""

Brown expected a smooth transition from the old company, Humana.

""It has been the exact opposite of that,"" she said. ""We have had referrals get lost, referrals not show up at all and having to reach out directly via phone call to Triwest agents to try and rectify the problem.""

Brown's daughter lives with autism. Referrals make sure she gets the treatment she needs from providers.

According to a by Mission Alpha Advocacy, 75% of TRICARE West Region families experienced disruptions after the January 1 shift.

Providers have also struggled with the transition.

""We couldn't get paid. We couldn't even get into the system,"" said Intergrated Behavior Solutions owner, Britt Sims. ""So it was weeks and weeks of trying to figure that out, and on into the end of January.. before we even talked to anybody that had any clue what was happening.""

The San Antonio clinic mainly serve children and teens with autism. They've had to make tough calls to keep the lights on.

Some have even has to drop TRICARE patients to stay afloat.

""We're four loans in. Most of us that are small providers are."" Sims said. ""It's not about it's not about money. It's not about claims. It's about services, direct services that these children with autism desperately need.""

Those loans total up to roughly $180,000 in debt to keep serving his 90% of his clients who fall under TriWest; and all at the risk of taking a hit to his practice.

""These kids are worth it. These families are worth it. So, let's keep fighting,"" he said. ""But we can't really take any more TRICARE kids.. right now, we don't know what's going to happen with that. So that's a burden for us.""

""We're at danger of approaching irreparable harm to our TRICARE provider network, and that will affect our military readiness and resilience and retention,"" said Mission Alpha Advocacy CEO Kristi Cabiao.

Advocates like Cabiao are now helping push those concerns to the desks of state and local leaders.

""They have responded, but I encourage families to keep reaching out so that it stays in the front of the minds of the congressional members,"" she said. ""Because there's a lot of noise and there's a lot of activity happening.""

""These people served our country, they've put their lives on the line in many situations,"" Brown said. ""This is just something that shouldn't have happened in the first place but -- now that it has happened — it needs to be resolved.""

We've heard from several other families facing the same problems.

We reached out to Triwest to figure out what's going on.

These include Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinators. You can find them at any military hospital or clinic.

Before you reach out to a BCAC, it’s important to first contact your regional contractor for help with TRICARE issues. Most TRICARE questions and concerns—such as those about enrollment, claims, referrals, or provider networks—can be handled directly through them. If you've already reached out to your contractor and still need help, a BCAC is your next step. They can take a deeper look at your issue and help guide you toward a resolution.

To get help, start by contacting the appropriate resource:

Questions about TRICARE eligibility or updates to a military service record: Contact your Service Personnel Component or the DMDC/DEERS Support Office (800-538-9552).

Questions about enrollment, claims, provider networks, or referrals: Contact your regional contractor first.

So, when should you get in touch with a BCAC? Read below to learn more.

What does a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator do?

BCACs can explain your TRICARE plan and how your benefit works. They work closely with regional contractors and claims processors to help resolve your concerns.

BCACs can address TRICARE-related questions, including:

Enrollment

Referrals and pre-authorizations

Claims processing delays

Covered services

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line

Getting healthcare services outside the military hospital or clinic

“You may have questions or concerns about TRICARE enrollment, coverage, or costs that haven’t been resolved through traditional channels. BCACs are people you can contact, and even meet with in person,” said Calvin Keller, health systems analyst, Benefit Education, at the Defense Health Agency. “They’re committed to answering your questions and addressing your concerns.”

For example, you may have a question about your TRICARE eligibility or enrollment as shown in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Maybe your record shows “No healthcare coverage plan” and you believe this is an error. After reaching out to the DMDC/DEERS Support Office, a BCAC can:

Explain the different messages you see in your DEERS record

Provide information on eligibility requirements

Guide you on how to follow up with your sponsor’s Service Personnel Component

BCACs don’t determine or fix TRICARE eligibility—but they can be a valuable resource in navigating the process.

Why reach out to a BCAC?

If you feel lost after trying to resolve issues with your regional contractor or service, there are still other TRICARE experts who can help. Consider reaching out to a BCAC. BCACs will work with you to understand your concerns and explore possible solutions.

Who can get help from a BCAC?

Do you still have questions after contacting your regional contractor? Any TRICARE beneficiary can visit or call a BCAC, even if you don’t regularly get care at a military hospital or clinic, or live far from one.

How do I find a BCAC?

You can meet with a BCAC in person by walking into their office. You don’t need an appointment. If you can’t get there in person, you can give them a call.

Each military hospital or clinic has contact information for their BCAC. Find their information online on the Find a Military Hospital or Clinic page. Or check out the Customer Service Community Directory. You can also ask the hospital staff for their office location if you’d like to meet in person.

What’s the difference between a BCAC and a patient advocate?

While both are there to support you, BCACs and patient advocates have different roles. BCACs help with TRICARE benefits. Patient advocates help with concerns or questions about healthcare services you received at a military hospital or clinic.

They can:

Explain the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and give you a copy

Explain military hospital or clinic policies, procedures, and operations
