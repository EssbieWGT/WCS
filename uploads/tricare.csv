August 12, 2025 | The pharma industry excels at collaborating with startup companies and scaling up the production of drugs and biologics, but they may be missing the big-picture perspective of the U.S. government as well as some of the cutting-edge research happening within academia. It’s a problematic norm that needs addressing if artificial intelligence (AI) is to benefit drug discovery and diagnostics as well as healthcare delivery in terms of safety, equity, and effectiveness, according to Shruthi Bharadwaj, Ph.D., program leader at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, an R&D center funded largely by the Department of Defense (DOD).

To that end, Bharadwaj will take to the stage at the upcoming Discovery on Target (DOT) conference in Boston to moderate a discussion about how to balance innovation, regulation, and real-world impact of AI in the life sciences and healthcare. At the table there will be representatives from industry, academia, and the federal government to discover and explore all the potential synergies, she says.

Joining her on the panel will be Nimita Limaye, Ph.D., research vice president for life sciences R&D strategy and technology at International Data Corporation (IDC); Sherri Cherry, MBA, deputy chief information officer at the Defense Health Agency (part of the Veterans Health Administration); Raquel Mura, PharmD, founder of RGM Life Sciences Consulting and former vice president and head of R&D North America at Sanofi; and William Streilein, Ph.D., principal staff with the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Fostering Change

Bharadwaj, who has a pharmaceutical biology background, recently joined MIT after working for two major pharmaceutical companies—first Novartis and later Sanofi—to head a team focused on leveraging AI for drug discovery. The Lincoln Laboratory has frequently convened multi-stakeholder groups to foster needed change in the way AI is viewed and deployed for the common good, she notes.

Her focus currently is an initiative seeking to understand how AI can be leveraged to predict the characteristics of drug molecules, which may in the future help the Food and Drug Administration better assess the safety and effectiveness of candidate medicines, she says. The work is supported by an unnamed but non-DOD government agency.

Outside of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Bharadwaj wears a few different hats. These include serving as an advisor to the Cancer Fund, an early-stage impact venture capital (VC) firm, by helping to evaluate startup proposals “for my own personal happiness,” she says.

Additionally, Bharadwaj is an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Technology Innovation Studio (Cambridge, Massachusetts) that brings together business leaders, scientists and researchers, serial entrepreneurs, angel/VC investors, industry experts, corporate innovation teams, and policy experts to pursue fresh approaches to problems. And for Nucleate, a student-led organization helping startups spin out of academia, she provides guidance on the development of pitch decks and connects researchers with potential sponsors or VCs.

Military Health

The Defense Health Agency, for its part, is keyed in on how AI might benefit the healthcare of veterans, Bharadwaj says, for example the diagnosis of mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide ideation, and depression. The possibilities include AI-assisted vocal analysis, predictive analytics to identify at-risk individuals, and the analysis of physiological data from wearables as well as text and language patterns.

Cherry is a strong advocate for women’s health, which may not yet have a use case for AI but is what connected her to Bharadwaj. What sparked their initial conversation was Bharadwaj’s interest in ensuring women are considered when creating strategies for increasing the overall effectiveness of the military, since 20% of service members are female.

Equity is clearly a challenge in the miliary, Bharadwaj says. The MIT Lincoln Laboratory is now working with a company to address some of these situations.

The inequities are many and extend to military uniforms that are designed for the height and size of men, she adds. Women generally don’t share the same general body build and proportions, meaning their comfort and morale as well as their safety and effectiveness in the field may be negatively affected.

AI-guided Pipeline

Many pharma companies are “pushing forward with AI or at least leveraging AI to some extent,” says Bharadwaj, which certainly includes both of her former employers. “Sanofi has been all in with AI for the last three years now,” aided by the 2023 hiring of venture capitalist and cardiology-trained Houman Ashrafian as its new head of R&D.

Since then, Sanofi’s strategic vision has focused more on being “an immunoscience company that’s powered by AI,” Bharadwaj continues. “The entire drug discovery pipeline is guided by AI, so Sanofi decides what the next drug candidate should be in oncology or dermatology based on AI recommendations; it’s pretty awesome actually.”

The recommendations are being made by predictive tools, which are inherently different than the large language models many people are familiar with by now, she adds. These are machine learning algorithms designed to analyze information such as chemical structures, biological activity, and clinical trial data to predict outcomes like drug properties, bioactivity, and toxicity. At Sanofi, Aily Labs has been a significant partner in building this sort of AI capability.

Novartis has moved at a swifter pace of adoption, having launched a first-of-its-kind AI Innovation Lab through a collaboration with Microsoft back in 2019 when Bharadwaj was part of the digital team. The initiative integrated AI and data science across the company’s operations from R&D to commercialization.

Connecting the Dots

The perspective of MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s William Streilein, who previously served as the chief AI and data officer for the DOD, could be particularly valuable to the overall conversation at the DOT conference. “He understands the U.S. government like no other... when it comes especially to AI and the implementation of AI and understanding how the government may see AI in the future,” says Bharadwaj.

The Department of Defense, while less focused on the life sciences, is immersed in AI and Streilein will be at liberty to share some of the particulars. As has already been publicly disclosed, it has been involved in efforts to establish new data centers to support AI applications.

One of Bharadwaj’s near-term intentions is to spotlight some of the “amazing work that MIT scientists have done but is not necessarily published or known to everyone... and connect them to pharma and perhaps the U.S. government,” she says. She wants also to help ensure that industry stays focused on the shared goal to “benefit humankind,” in part by better understanding the role of regulators and how to scale up research-level discoveries and not get distracted by the minutiae of drug making.",,N,0.0,2025-08-12 03:56:10.160129

Sometimes it comes down to freedom of choice versus monopolies, and restricting certain healthcare-related businesses while granting monopolies to others isn’t fixing the problems, but creating new ones.

Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas, and New York are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions. However, they’ve been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation’s three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn’t named, the law exempts any pharmacy that “exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state.” Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that’s because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa’s law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment’s protections for commercial speech.

There’s no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can’t be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, “Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It’s important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.”

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we’re still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as “crony capitalism,” but it’s not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don’t understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that’s not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.",https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/77/5e5b54f0-aa46-4ed1-aeb2-ebff01d2f8ee.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 13:56:23.077776

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.","As a cancer patient covered by my husband’s TRICARE health insurance, I read Rob Maness’ July 11 guest column opposing pharmacy benefit manager reform with disappointment. His argument misses the reality for families like mine.

He claims that Louisiana's proposed ban on PBMs from owning pharmacies would create barriers for veterans to access prescriptions. But PBMs already create barriers by dictating ultra-low reimbursement rates to local independent pharmacies, preventing them from participating in TRICARE. That means patients like me and my husband, a retired veteran, are forced to use PBM mail-order services whether we want to or not. Mail order might sound convenient, but it often leads to delays, lost medications and zero personal care. I’ve experienced this danger firsthand.

Maness tries to scare us by saying reform will close pharmacies and displace veterans. What’s more likely is that locally operated pharmacies and non-PBM chains will expand when unfair competition from powerful, vertically integrated PBMs is removed. When PBMs own pharmacies, they set reimbursement rates to favor themselves while underpaying competitors, driving them out of business. Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would end this conflict of interest, keeping locally operated pharmacies open and thriving.

Here in Louisiana, independents have always served rural and underserved communities where big chains refuse to go. They provide personalized care, deliver medications and work hard to ensure no one goes without. The idea that only PBM chains can serve patients is false and insulting to the small-business pharmacists working daily to keep Louisianans healthy.

PBMs use their ownership of pharmacies to manipulate the system. They underpay locally operated pharmacies, force veterans into their mail-order programs and overcharge TRICARE while pocketing the difference. That isn’t about access and quality care. It’s about greed.

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.

MHSRS, a four-day event which takes place annually at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Conference Center, provided personnel with multiple forums to demonstrate the impact NMR&D research has on the DoD warfighter.

Over 100 NMR&D personnel attended MHSRS this year, including military, civilian and contractor research, medical and support personnel. Attendees participated in a range of conference activities, speaking at 26 breakout sessions, presenting 95 research posters across three poster sessions and engaging with stakeholders and potential collaborators throughout the Military Health System.

“This year’s MHSRS was an outstanding demonstration of how the talented scientists of Navy Medicine Research and Development work together to field medical solutions in support of Joint Force health and readiness,” said Capt. Franca Jones, commander, Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC). “This year’s symposium highlighted extensive collaborations between commands in NMR&D, other service laboratories, and industry and academia.”

“MHSRS is really an opportunity to help our junior researchers understand our military medical research environment,” said Capt. William Howard, commanding officer of Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU)-Dayton. “We also use it as an opportunity for our seasoned researchers to remain calibrated and find opportunities. We try to maximize our participation for the benefit of our command as well as for military research in general.”

During the opening plenary session, two NMR&D commands were recognized. Justin Handy, from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) in Groton, CT, received the Outstanding Research Accomplishment for a Military Team award on behalf of the Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team. The team was recognized for their work to improve submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching, which fosters readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention within the Submarine Force.

Dr. Doug Jones, Dr. Timothy Dunn, and John Marciano, from the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, CA, received the Warfighter Medicine Research Public Communication Award for their work raising public awareness of their DOD-sponsored medical research in the area of arctic performance.

“Dr. Jones, Dr. Dunn, and their team of top scientists work diligently in the background to help our sailors and soldiers do their jobs in the harshest of environments.” Said Dr. Ken Earhart, NHRC scientific director. “It’s exciting and immensely rewarding when the world takes notice, recognizing their individual achievements, showcasing the real-world impact of their important research, and offering inspiration to others to pursue careers in STEM.”

Three NMR&D poster presentations were recognized during the final awards ceremony, out of over 1400 posters from throughout the three poster sessions. Dr. Sabrina Snyder, from NAMRU San Antonio, was awarded first place for her poster on the survival analysis of a dental self-healing composite, and Dr. Kayla Septer, from NMRC, was awarded second place, for her poster on the antigenic characterization of currently circulating seasonal influenza strains. Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Crouch, from NHRC, was given an honorable mention for Poster Session 2 for his presentation on using anomaly seasonality decomposition and artificial neural network modeling to predict febrile respiratory illness among U.S. military recruitment populations.

Dr. Elliot Dirr, of NAMRU-Dayton, was also recognized during this ceremony, getting third place in the Young Investigators competition, for his presentation on how the partial pressure of oxygen and nitrogen impacts the development of noise-induced hearing loss.

“This year we had two oral presentations, nine posters and two session chairs, and we’re especially proud of Dr. Elliott Dirr for his win in the young investigators category,” said Howard. “Our command cultivates the mindset of starting all research endeavors with the needs of the warfighter, and I know that is reflected in our contributions to military medical research.”

With over 3500 registrants this year, MHSRS presents a unique opportunity for researchers and leadership to meet with future collaborators in the Military Health System.

NMR&D is led by NMRC, and is comprised of NSMRL, NHRC, and NAMRU Dayton, San Antonio, INDO PACIFIC, EURAFCENT, and SOUTH.

MHSRS is the DoD’s premier scientific meeting that focuses specifically on the unique medical needs of service members. This annual educational symposium brings together healthcare professionals, researchers, and DoD leaders for four days of critical learning, intensive idea sharing and relationship building.

NMR&D, a global collective of eight commands, conducts research in support of Navy, Marine Corps and joint U.S. warfighter health, readiness and lethality, across a broad spectrum of activity from basic science in the laboratory to field studies in austere and remote areas of the world to investigations in operational environments. NMR&D studies infectious diseases, biological warfare detection and defense, combat casualty care, environmental health concerns, directed energy health effects, aerospace and undersea medicine, medical modeling, simulation, operational mission support, epidemiology and behavioral sciences.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9249732/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 10:56:12.781301

web posted August 11, 2025

We don't get to pick and choose who gets to enjoy constitutional rights and who doesn't. They apply to all of us — even the large healthcare companies everyone seems intent on crusading against these days. Sometimes it comes down to freedom of choice versus monopolies, and restricting certain healthcare related businesses while granting monopolies to others isn't fixing the problems, but creating new ones.

Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution's Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas and New York, are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions.

However, they've been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation's three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn't named, the law exempts any pharmacy that ""exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state."" Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that's because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa's law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment's protections for commercial speech.

There's no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can't be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, ""Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It's important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.""

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we're still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as ""crony capitalism,"" but it's not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don't understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that's not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.

I don’t have direct advice for the work around but something that may help you with one, if it helps you get a diagnosis that requires it. Have you been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder? Ever had your genetics pulled for obesity genes? I had the best doc dive down the rate obesity genetics pool, and discovered I had a specific genetic mutation. This diagnosis requires I take glp1 for life, the only other medication that tears it nearly killed me for some reason.

TFL is not just for the 65+ crowd. I am the spouse of a young retiree and I am on TFL because I am disabled and get SSDI and Medicare. I am in my late 40s. I was able to get approved for Mounjaro based on a history of high A1C even though the high numbers were the side effect of being on steroids.

It is actually extremely common for retiree benefits to be reduced as a cost cutting measure because their budget line is usually smaller. The corporate world does it all the time. Especially with government health insurance, they have to keep within the allotted budget so all those bureaucrats can get their usual kickbacks.

CALL TO ACTION: Help a Warrior, Father, and Advocate Get Life-Saving Care

SFC David Hong has spent his entire adult life serving others—on the battlefield, at home, and in the veteran community. Now, he needs our help.

David was born in Brazil, immigrated to the U.S. in 1983, and proudly joined the U.S. Army in 2009 as a Religious Affairs Specialist (56M). He deployed to Korea and Afghanistan, and beyond his military service, he’s a devoted husband and father of three, including a child with special needs who inspired his advocacy for military families facing similar challenges.

In July 2022, during a routine colonoscopy, David’s life changed forever—he was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.

Since then, he’s fought like hell through multiple surgeries, 24 rounds of chemotherapy, and now, the cancer has returned to his liver. His providers gave him 2-5 years to live—but they underestimated David’s will to fight.

David was offered a chance: A cutting-edge, FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment called histotripsy—which destroys tumors in the liver using sound waves, with minimal risk and quick recovery. The procedure is 85-95% effective and could give David a chance at more time with his family and to continue serving others.

But here’s the kicker: TRICARE denied the procedure for a third time yesterday, even against his doctors’ recommendations (see denial in comments).

At HunterSeven, we fight for our warriors, and we were stunned to see how much advocacy had already been done on David’s behalf—to no avail. So we’ve decided: we’re just going to get it done.

We need to raise $45,000 to fund this life-saving procedure.

No red tape. No delays. Just action.

Please share.

Please help us give David the fighting chance he’s earned.
