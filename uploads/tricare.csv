Air Force Medical Command leadership hosted a consolidated standup ceremony for its medical readiness commands, MRC-Alpha and MRC-Bravo, Jan. 15, 2025, during the Air Force Medical Service’s 2025 Senior Leadership Workshop in Leesburg, Virginia.

An order from the Secretary of the Air Force activated and assigned the readiness commands to AFMEDCOM, effective Sept. 14, 2024. Leaders delayed the ceremony until key organizational milestones were accomplished. With nearly 500 senior medical leaders gathered to discuss the future of operational medical support, AFMEDCOM leaders selected SLW for the ceremony.

Lt. Gen. John J. DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and Space Force Surgeon General and Commander, Air Force Medical Command, formally published the orders to stand up MRC-Alpha, based in San Antonio, Texas, and MRC-Bravo, based in Falls Church, Virginia.

While addressing the audience, he recognized the commanders who have led the organizations since they were formed: Maj. Gen. (Dr.) Thomas Harrell who is MRC-A’s commander and is Defense Health Network-Central’s director; and, Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder who is MRC-B’s commander and DHN-Continental’s director.

DeGoes thanked Ryder and Harrell for their efforts and said, “their innovative leadership and tireless work over the past two years led to this day, building our medical readiness commands and wings from the ground up. I look forward to continuing to strengthen AFMEDCOM as they both lead these medical readiness commands, meeting all missions, anytime, anywhere.”

The official standup of both MRCs signifies another step toward solidifying the command-and-control functions for more than 25,000 medical forces who represent the Department of Air Force’s operational medicine capability as the organization continues to partner with the Defense Health Agency for health care delivery.

“Our benchmark is mission capable Airmen and Guardians, deployable medics, and sustained access to trusted care for our families,” DeGoes said.

Harrell and Ryder execute authorities under the U.S. Air Force and Defense Health Agency that strengthen unity of effort. As the MRC/CCs, they oversee medical readiness requirements and deliver operational medicine, and as DHN directors they ensure safe, accessible, high-quality health care for beneficiaries.

Within the intermediate command under AFMEDCOM, the MRC/CCs prioritize readiness.

“This structure will ensure that Air Force operational requirements are clearly articulated, advocated and integrated within the joint healthcare enterprise,” DeGoes said. “MRCs empower faster decisions and flatter communications, each with an accountable leader to call and with the authority to address any readiness or health care concern.”

Air Force medical leaders began the first series of inter-command transfers to align medical Airmen under the new AFMEDCOM structure in March 2025. The process features a deliberate, conditions-based approach projected to continue over a two-year period to ensure minimal disruption for medical Airmen.

During the first tranche, the 316th Medical Group at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, and the 316th Medical Squadron at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Virginia, transferred from Air Force District of Washington to the 79th Medical Wing under MRC-B. This ICT was completed Sept. 9, 2025.

MRC-A has initiated two ICTs realigning medical units from the Air Education and Training Command to MRC-A. The first, which began Sept. 5, 2025, realigned medical Airmen in the 59th MDW under the intermediate management command. The second, which started, Dec. 2, 2025, initiated the transfer of multiple medical groups from AETC to the MRC-A’s 359th Medical Wing.

The commanders thanked their MRC staff, network teams, and families after the unfurling of the command flags, and reinforced to the medical forces present to be proactive in engaging with them and their wing commanders through the cultural shift AFMEDCOM brings.

Harrell emphasized for leaders to connect with their Airmen and to set the tone in their organizations. “It all happens because of you and the environment you set as leaders,” he said. “Our success fully rests on the individual initiative and success of our Airmen you lead.”

After initiating inter-command transfers, the commanders said they remain resolute in driving mission success and sustaining forward momentum into 2026.

“The activation of the MRCs is a renewal of our promise to provide the best medical support to our warfighters and the best care to our families,” Ryder said. “As your commander, I am invested in you. AFMEDCOM’s success is dependent on you, leading through challenges, making tough decisions and holding the line of accountability.”",,N,0.0,2026-01-16 22:56:52.886805

WEXMAC TITUS will provide supplies and services in support of but not limited to supporting the six phases of the continuum of military operations in support of the geographic Combatant Command's joint operations, coalition partners, and other federal agencies in setting and sustaining the theater through the following requirements: theater opening (includes reception, staging, onward-movement, and integration support; sustainment; theater distribution; and stability operations and Defense Support of Civil Authorities support. The WEXMAC TITUS description of contractual scope provides that services and supplies provided through the performance of this contract include but are not limited to humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, contingency, exercise, lodging, logistics, water-based, and land-based support. The base period began in January 2025 and is expected to be completed by December 2029; if all options are exercised, the performance period will be completed by December 2034. The increased contract ceiling modifications will be incorporated into the contractors' existing base performance period with one five-year option with individual requirements performed under task orders when specific dates and locations are identified. If the option period is exercised, the total estimated contract maximum for each contractor could be $65,000,000,000. Work will be performed in the U.S. and outlying territories outlined in the original contract.

In a significant move for the state’s service members, the Senate passed Senate Bill 2018, establishing the Mississippi National Guard Tricare Premium Reimbursement Program. The legislation is designed to provide effectively free health insurance coverage for eligible members of the Mississippi National Guard by reimbursing premium costs.

Supporters of the bill noted that the program serves as both a recruitment tool and a “thank you” to the thousands of Mississippians serving in the Guard.

The chamber also looked to modernize the state’s economic engine by passing Senate Bill 2016. This bill would transition tourism oversight into a stand-alone Mississippi Department of Tourism. The new department would be led by an executive director and supported by an independent staff and a newly created Mississippi Tourism Marketing Advisory Board.

On the infrastructure front, the Senate moved to ensure the continued stability of the state’s roads. Senate Bill 2019 was passed to maintain the current funding structure for the State Highway Fund, directing the first $80 million in annual lottery proceeds toward transportation projects.

The legislative pace is expected to quicken as the Senate met a key deadline on Wednesday, Jan. 14, for requesting the drafting of general bills and constitutional amendments. Lawmakers now face a Monday, Jan. 19, deadline for the formal introduction of those measures.

Amid the policy debates, the Capitol rotunda echoed with music on Tuesday, Jan. 13. The Starkville High School Choir performed for lawmakers, continuing Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann’s tradition of showcasing student talent from across the state.

When a military working dog gets sick overseas, the issue can involve more than just animal health. When service members deploy to regions with different diseases, there are more than just human health hazards to consider. When food safety becomes a problem at a military dining facility, the cause could be germs originating from humans, animals, or the environment. These interconnected health challenges require an integrated solution, and that's where One Health comes in.

""I prefer to think of One Health as integrated public health, working collaboratively across multiple disciplines,"" said Dr. Kristina McElroy, Veterinary Defense Support of Civil Authorities and interagency coordinator, Veterinary Services Division, Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Falls Church, Virginia. “This transdisciplinary approach guides my daily work as a veterinarian in DHA-Public Health.”

This collaborative approach is protecting military communities worldwide by recognizing that human health, animal health, and environmental health are closely connected.

What is One Health?

One Health is a simple but powerful idea: The health of people, animals, and the environment are linked. When one area has a problem, it can affect the others. For military communities, One Health means taking a team approach to prevent diseases, ensure food safety, and protect service members and their families.

Deployment health protection

When service members deploy, they may face unique health challenges that civilian communities rarely encounter. Service members travel frequently, encounter or work with animals, and deploy to regions with different risks of infectious disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, zoonotic diseases are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, and are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial parasites, and fungi.

""Different vectors may be present that increase risk of certain zoonotic diseases, so we consider different parasite prevention and sometimes different daily management practices to limit exposure,"" said Lt. Col. Crystal Doyle, chief of animal medicine, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""We must also be familiar with differing requirements for reportable diseases in the various countries in which we work.""

This global perspective is also essential for protecting military families. When service members deploy to different regions, they may encounter diseases that aren’t prevalent in their home stations. One Health approaches help identify these risks early and develop prevention strategies. “The benefits of One Health aren't theoretical; they're saving lives and protecting military operations every day,” said McElroy.

""During outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, chikungunya, Zika, as well as COVID-19 — which are all zoonotic diseases — the collaborative interdisciplinary approach of One Health has protected service members' health,"" said McElroy. ""Veterinary Services has worked hand in hand with colleagues at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, the military services and U.S. government agencies to ensure guidance and recommendations are coordinated and appropriate for the military population.""

Military working dogs

The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs. MWDs are valuable team members who can be affected by zoonotic diseases that can also affect service members.

""There have been MWD kennels with multiple dogs affected by similar clinical signs and symptoms that pointed to a possible zoonotic disease,"" said Doyle. ""While testing was pending to determine a definitive diagnosis, operational tempo was decreased to limit human exposure to the suspected zoonotic disease.""

Military veterinarians also submit ticks from their patients for disease screening, or disease confirmation if a patient is suspected of being infected, said Doyle.

“We routinely submit blood samples from our MWD population to screen for tick-borne diseases, many of which are also found in the human population (such as Lyme disease).”

Food Safety Protection

Food safety is a key part of the One Health mission, as military dining facilities serve thousands of meals daily. ""The military uses a multidisciplinary, multiservice, and interagency approach to analyze food safety and security from a One Health perspective,"" said Lt. Col. Melissa Hehr, deputy chief, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""This requires close coordination amongst agencies and military services with responsibilities for food procurement, food protection, food sanitation, preventive medicine, public health, diagnostic laboratory, policy, and regulatory functions.""

Global health security benefits

One Health approaches don't just protect individual service members; they strengthen global health security for everyone.

""Military One Health initiatives leverage unique military capabilities to contribute to the United States' global health security efforts,"" said McElroy. ""Specifically for veterinary services, the DOW (Department of War) provides training to veterinarians and public health professionals in partner nations, strengthening their capacity to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks.""

The military also helps strengthen public health infrastructure worldwide, including ""laboratories, surveillance systems, and disease reporting networks"" that benefit both military and civilian populations, said McElroy.

Monitoring emerging threats

Military veterinarians, physicians, environmental health specialists, and public health experts work together using One Health principles. This teamwork helps identify health threats early and respond more effectively than any single group could. An example of this type of collaboration can be found in how these teams are managing the threat of New World screwworm.

“There is currently ongoing collaboration between military veterinary, medical, biosurveillance, and pest management teams to monitor and prepare for a potential incursion of New World screwworm into the United States,” said Hehr. “This flesh-eating parasite is actually a perfect example of a One Health problem where an integrative approach is being used to analyze, monitor, and mitigate the threat posed to human, animal, and environmental health, as well as military operations, food and agriculture, and national security.”

Overcoming challenges

Implementing One Health approaches in military settings requires overcoming unique challenges. ""I think the greatest challenge to implementing a One Health approach lies in our ability to develop a mutual understanding of the capabilities, responsibilities, and authorities of the various organizations and entities that are required for effective One Health integration under different contexts,"" said Hehr. Military health teams work to build these relationships through various communication methods, including news articles, information papers, social media posts, email, meetings, webinars, and educational courses, said Hehr.

Working together for health

The success of One Health depends on collaboration across different specialties and organizations.

""At DHA Veterinary Services, we strive for collaborative communication and integration across the joint force and entire DOW,"" McElroy explains.

This teamwork includes partnerships among military veterinarians, human health professionals, environmental specialists, and public health experts from all service branches. The approach is proactive rather than reactive. By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely. As health threats become more complex and global, One Health approaches become more important for protecting military communities.

Leadership made the change after an Army doctor was charged with illegally recording videos of patients during appointments.
“Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer at the Defense Health Agency.

Leadership made the change after an Army doctor was charged with illegally recording videos of patients during appointments.

“Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer at the Defense Health Agency. “Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.”

The previous policy required medical facilities to accommodate a patient’s request for a chaperone but did not require that they be asked their preference.

DHA shared the update online Thursday following months of scrutiny about how Maj. Blaine McGraw, an OB-GYN, could be criminally charged with recording videos more than 40 patients at Fort Hood, Texas, using his cellphone.

In total, the doctor is charged with 54 counts of indecent visual recording involving 44 women, according to the Army. All but one of those women received medical care from McGraw in 2025 at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood. One woman was recorded at an off-post home.

Many women have said they did request a chaperone or their partner be present during appointments but were denied by McGraw, according to a lawsuit filed in Bell County, Texas, on behalf of 95 women who were patients of McGraw. During those appointments, McGraw would keep the camera lens of his phone facing outward from the breast pocket of his clothing, according to court documents.

There are internal military reviews to determine if the hospital was following policies and systems put in place to protect patients from abuse.

“Cases like McGraw prove that predators thrive in the shadows of ‘discretionary’ policies,” said Andrew Cobos, attorney for the women. “If the DHA is serious about stopping sexual assault in military medicine, they must stop treating patient safety as a suggestion. We need mandatory chaperones who answer to an independent board, not the doctors they are supposed to be monitoring.”

DHA defined a chaperone as an unbiased third party to any exam or clinical visit who is there to safeguard the patient and staff.

“These chaperones are members of the clinical team who are discreet and protect privacy. They’ll immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct,” according to DHA.

Patients can request the chaperone while making the appointment or during it, and staff “will make a reasonable effort to provide a chaperone of the preferred sex.” If someone is not available, patients can reschedule the visit.

Sensitive appointments that require a provider to ask a patient’s preference include examination, treatment or procedure of the genitalia, rectum or female breasts, or forensic health care examinations. This policy may be waived in emergency situations, according to DHA.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/jhq1k9-9010755.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/9010755.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-16 15:56:31.104876

Is TRICARE’s Shield Coverage and Q4 Revenue Strength Altering The Investment Case For Guardant Health (GH)?

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Sasha Jovanovic

January 16, 2026

In January 2026, Guardant Health reported unaudited revenue of approximately US$280 million for Q4 and US$981 million for 2025, reflecting strong year-on-year growth across its oncology and Shield colorectal cancer screening tests.

At the same time, TRICARE’s decision to cover Guardant’s FDA-approved Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening with no copay for eligible active-duty service members and families significantly broadens access to this non-invasive screening option within the U.S. military population.

Next, we’ll examine how TRICARE’s Shield coverage and Guardant’s recent revenue strength may influence the company’s investment narrative and risk profile.

Guardant Health Investment Narrative Recap

To own Guardant Health, you need to believe that blood-based cancer diagnostics will keep gaining traction across both oncology care and population screening, and that the company can eventually translate strong test volumes into sustainable profitability. The latest unaudited 2025 revenue of about US$981 million, together with robust Q4 growth, supports the demand side of that thesis, while persistent cash burn and ongoing losses remain the most important near term risk. TRICARE’s Shield coverage appears supportive but not thesis changing on its own.

The TRICARE decision to cover Shield for eligible active-duty service members and families matters because it adds another large, institutional payer to Shield’s coverage footprint, alongside Medicare and the VA Community Care Network. For investors focused on Shield as a key growth driver, this announcement fits within the broader catalyst of expanding reimbursement and clinical adoption for blood-based colorectal cancer screening, and it provides another real world datapoint that major health systems are willing to fund this type of testing.

But despite this progress, investors should also be aware that ongoing high R&D and Shield spend could still...

Exploring Other Perspectives

Four Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates for Guardant Health range from US$68.10 to US$176.29, underscoring how far apart individual views can be. When you set these side by side with the recent revenue momentum in oncology and Shield, it becomes clear that different investors may weigh growth potential and cash burn risk very differently, so it is worth examining several perspectives before forming your own view.

The Defense Health Agency recently published its chaperone policy across all military hospitals and clinics worldwide. You can request a chaperone for any physical exam or medical or dental visit. Your provider may also request a chaperone for these appointments.

“Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. “Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.”

What do chaperones do?

Chaperones (or “standbys”) serve as an unbiased third party to any exam or clinical visit between you and your provider. They’re a safeguard for both patients and staff. They can help you and your provider feel at ease, especially during sensitive exams.

These chaperones are members of the clinical team who are discreet and protect privacy. They’ll immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct.

You have the right to request a chaperone at any time before or during an appointment or exam. If you request a chaperone when scheduling an appointment, staff can add a note that you’ve asked for a chaperone. Staff will make a reasonable effort to provide a chaperone of the preferred sex if you or your provider request it. If a chaperone of the preferred sex is requested and not immediately available, you’ll be assisted in rescheduling at a time when one is available.

Health care staff must offer you a chaperone before performing a sensitive exam. (Note: There may be exceptions for emergency situations.) You can decline a chaperone, but health care staff may also decline to perform a sensitive exam (e.g., examination, treatment or procedure of the genitalia, rectum, or female breasts, or forensic health care examinations) in nonemergency situations if there is no chaperone present. To learn more about potentially sensitive exams, you can read the policy.

You can request a chaperone by talking to your provider or other hospital or clinic staff. You don’t have to explain why you’re making the request.

Who can serve as a chaperone?

The following staff members may serve as chaperones:

Physicians, dentists

Physician assistants, psychologists, social workers

Nurses

Medics, corpsmen

Technicians, paraprofessionals

Medical support assistants, or MSAs

Residents, students with a formal training agreement

Military hospital or clinic volunteers

Note: Sexual assault response coordinators, victim advocates, or family advocacy personnel may accompany you for health care associated with interpersonal violence. They can accompany you if you request their presence. But they can’t serve as a chaperone.

What are my other patient rights?

You may notice signs or posters in your military hospital or clinic that explain your right to a chaperone. Want to learn more about your rights? Visit TRICARE Rights and Responsibilities.

How can I get support if I have questions?

Do you have more questions about the chaperone policy? Or, do you have concerns about the care you received at a military hospital or clinic?

Patient advocates can help. They’re representatives who can help with your concerns or questions about services at a military hospital or clinic. They can:

Listen to your concerns

Address complaints about health care services you received

Explain military hospital or clinic policies

Mediate concerns between you and your provider

These teams deploy to the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia at various times during the year. It is the center’s mission to ensure Sailors and Marines onboard those ships have access to quality medical care, if needed.

Throughout its proud history, NMCSD has established itself as a leader in the field of medicine. That reputation for excellence continues today as the staff propels NMCSD into the 21st century.

At first glance, they might seem interchangeable—both are integral parts of providing care for service members, veterans, and their families—but each has its unique function.

TRICARE is a comprehensive health insurance program run by the Department of Defense (DoD). It offers various plans designed to meet the diverse needs of active duty personnel, retirees, and their dependents. Think of it as an umbrella that covers a wide range of medical services—from routine check-ups to specialized treatments. With multiple options like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, beneficiaries can choose what best fits their lifestyle and healthcare requirements.

On the other hand, TriWest Healthcare Alliance operates under contract with TRICARE to provide specific services primarily in regions where military treatment facilities may not be readily available. Founded in 1996, TriWest plays a crucial role in administering programs such as the Veterans Choice Program and Patient-Centered Community Care Program. This partnership ensures that veterans have access to quality care without unnecessary delays or complications.

For instance, if you’re stationed far from a military hospital or clinic but need immediate attention for your child’s health issue—like those addressed recently between Children's Hospital Colorado and TriWest—you’ll find that having both systems working together makes accessing necessary pediatric care much smoother.

The relationship between these two entities highlights how collaboration enhances patient experiences within military healthcare. While TRICARE sets up broad coverage policies aimed at ensuring all eligible individuals receive adequate medical support regardless of location, TriWest focuses on operationalizing these policies through local partnerships with civilian providers who understand community-specific needs.

Moreover, this collaboration isn't just about logistics; it's also about addressing challenges like reimbursement rates which often fall short compared to actual costs incurred by hospitals treating patients under these programs—a point raised by Jena Hausmann from Children’s Colorado during recent negotiations with TriWest.

In essence, every time you reach out for help regarding your family’s health while serving our country, you're engaging with either one—or sometimes both—of these vital organizations dedicated to making sure no veteran goes without needed care.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,0.0,2026-01-15 20:56:28.152983

The counties affected are Sherman and Wallace.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather/2026-jan-14/state-emergency-alert-wildfires-kansas for updates.

Most military families have no idea what’s actually available to them when it comes to health and healing—and it’s not their fault. Somewhere along the way, we were taught to believe that Tricare is only for “sick care.” Quick appointments. Basic labs. Prescriptions to manage symptoms.

And that real healing—the kind that looks at root causes, hormones, gut health, inflammation, toxins, and chronic stress—was something only people with extra cash could access. Tricare certainly isn’t telling you.

When I ran out of cash on my own healing journey, I decided I would be the one to read every Tricare publication. And if it could be done, I would figure it out. Here’s what I’ve found: Tricare quietly covers a plethora of health-optimizing, root-cause healing modalities—and I’ve cracked the code on how to use it.

Not hypothetically. Not “in theory.” But in real life—my life, and now hundreds of others’.

This applies to Active Duty, Prime, and Select. It has the most applicability to Select, where you have enormous freedom. Active Duty and Prime are more difficult, but there are options.

I’m currently writing the user manual so military families can do this too. I also work directly with providers so they can maximize Tricare for you—and then I connect you with those providers.

If functional medicine style appointments, in-depth testing, hormone replacement therapy, metabolic optimization, advanced therapies, and even powerful bodywork like craniosacral therapy or fascia release make you lean in a little closer… keep reading.

Care That Actually Listens to You

Many providers are leaving traditional in-network institutions in favor of a whole-body, wellness-focused—many would say functional medicine–type—approach. An approach designed to do what so many military spouses are desperate for: connect the dots of your health story and fix what actually went wrong.

That’s what many of us desperately want and need.

We live with increased toxic exposures, massive amounts of stress and fatigue. We move constantly. We live in moldy military housing. We have babies, raise them alone, manage tight budgets, and carry a lot of feelings—often quietly.

Instead of asking, “What medication matches this symptom?” These providers ask, “Why is this happening in the first place?” And then fix it.

With Tricare, you can work with providers who spend an hour or more listening to you, run advanced diagnostics like extensive lab work and functional medicine testing, and create a personalized plan.

Some focus on hormone replacement therapy, thyroid optimization, weight loss, and/or chronic inflammation. Others specialize in detoxification from environmental toxins, systemic infections, parasites, Lyme disease and co-infections, and other complex chronic conditions causing inflammation, brain fog, autoimmune disease, infertility, and more.

Many therapies are also covered by Tricare. Two that were especially helpful for me—and partially to fully covered—are IV therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

With Tricare Select, you get to choose the provider that best fits your needs. If they are a participating provider, you’ll pay your 20% cost share until you hit your annual cap—after that, it’s completely covered. If they are a non-participating but verified provider, you pay upfront and submit a superbill for reimbursement.

And yes—I teach you exactly how to do that and get reimbursed.

Hands-On Healing Matters, Too

Hands-on healing therapies can also be covered. These therapies help release physical restrictions, stored trauma, stuck detox pathways, and nervous system dysregulation—things many military spouses carry without even realizing it. I know I did. This is where my healing became felt, not just measured on a lab report.

Some of the therapies that have been incredibly helpful in my healing journey include cranial osteopathy, craniosacral therapy, visceral manipulation, and fascia release. And yes—they are all covered by Tricare when the provider is Tricare-authorized.

I teach families exactly what that means and how to find those providers.

The Real Takeaway

We’re doing something that has never really been done before: using health insurance for true wellness. If this excites you, you’re my kind of people. You do not have to settle for surface-level care. You do not have to choose between healing and affordability.

Tricare can be demystified. I want to show you all the options you didn’t know existed—and exactly how to use them—so you can make the best decisions for you and your family.

I’m writing the user manual for wellness within Tricare that Tricare will never give you. I’d be overjoyed if you joined me on this journey.

The Defense Health Agency recently published its chaperone policy across all military hospitals and clinics worldwide. You can request a chaperone for any physical exam or medical or dental visit. Your provider may also request a chaperone for these appointments.

“Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. “Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.”

What do chaperones do?

Chaperones (or “standbys”) serve as an unbiased third party to any exam or clinical visit between you and your provider. They’re a safeguard for both patients and staff. They can help you and your provider feel at ease, especially during sensitive exams.

These chaperones are members of the clinical team who are discreet and protect privacy. They’ll immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct.

You have the right to request a chaperone at any time before or during an appointment or exam. If you request a chaperone when scheduling an appointment, staff can add a note that you’ve asked for a chaperone. Staff will make a reasonable effort to provide a chaperone of the preferred sex if you or your provider request it. If a chaperone of the preferred sex is requested and not immediately available, you’ll be assisted in rescheduling at a time when one is available.

Health care staff must offer you a chaperone before performing a sensitive exam. (Note: There may be exceptions for emergency situations.) You can decline a chaperone, but health care staff may also decline to perform a sensitive exam (e.g., examination, treatment or procedure of the genitalia, rectum, or female breasts, or forensic health care examinations) in nonemergency situations if there is no chaperone present. To learn more about potentially sensitive exams, you can read the policy.

You can request a chaperone by talking to your provider or other hospital or clinic staff. You don’t have to explain why you’re making the request.

Who can serve as a chaperone?

The following staff members may serve as chaperones:

Physicians, dentists

Physician assistants, psychologists, social workers

Nurses

Medics, corpsmen

Technicians, paraprofessionals

Medical support assistants, or MSAs

Residents, students with a formal training agreement

Military hospital or clinic volunteers

Note: Sexual assault response coordinators, victim advocates, or family advocacy personnel may accompany you for health care associated with interpersonal violence. They can accompany you if you request their presence. But they can’t serve as a chaperone.

What are my other patient rights?

You may notice signs or posters in your military hospital or clinic that explain your right to a chaperone. Want to learn more about your rights? Visit TRICARE Rights and Responsibilities.

How can I get support if I have questions?

Do you have more questions about the chaperone policy? Or, do you have concerns about the care you received at a military hospital or clinic?

Patient advocates can help. They’re representatives who can help with your concerns or questions about services at a military hospital or clinic. They can:

Listen to your concerns

Address complaints about health care services you received

Explain military hospital or clinic policies

Mediate concerns between you and your provider

Faster decisions through quantum data processing Beyond cyberspace intelligence gathering, the report highlights how quantum computing could reshape command and control.

The disclosure came from Science and Technology Daily, an official state newspaper, which said the People’s Liberation Army is already testing early quantum cyberwarfare tools during frontline missions.

According to the report, more than 10 experimental quantum cyber warfare tools are now “under development,” with several already being “tested in front-line missions.” The work is being led by a supercomputing laboratory at the National University of Defense Technology.

The effort brings together cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and quantum technology to build systems that can handle complex military data faster than current methods.

PLA commanders believe quantum computing could process massive volumes of battlefield information within seconds. That speed could help commanders make decisions faster and allocate resources more efficiently during high-pressure operations. An unnamed officer told the newspaper that “speed and change” were the main drivers behind the development of these new cyber weapons.

The officer added that the guiding idea was that “to design a good weapon, one must first think about the form of the next war.” This suggests the PLA sees quantum cyber capabilities as essential for conflicts where digital systems, data dominance, and rapid adaptation could decide outcomes.

Faster decisions through quantum data processing

Beyond cyberspace intelligence gathering, the report highlights how quantum computing could reshape command and control. By rapidly analyzing data from many sources, quantum systems could give commanders near real-time awareness of changing battlefield conditions. This could reduce delays between detection, decision-making, and action.

Liu Wei, a researcher at the PLA’s Information Support Force, said the team is working on “new models of battlefield awareness powered by cybersecurity.” These models aim to merge data from different domains into a clearer operational picture.

According to South China Morning Post, the article added that “[The team] fully leverages the advantages of the public service platform system’s integration and all-domain support capabilities”. This approach combines information streams that were previously handled separately, creating a more unified view for military planners.

Detecting stealth threats and secure navigation

The report also points to quantum sensing and positioning as key areas of interest. Quantum sensing technologies could improve air defense systems by detecting stealth aircraft that traditional radar might miss. This could reduce the effectiveness of low-observable platforms designed to evade detection.

Quantum positioning systems are also seen as a means to develop highly accurate navigation tools that are resistant to spoofing or jamming. In modern conflicts, disrupting satellite navigation has become a common tactic. Systems based on quantum principles could continue to function even when GPS signals are denied or manipulated.

These capabilities would not only support combat operations but also protect logistics, communications, and coordination across large areas.

Close ties between researchers and front-line troops

The newspaper said researchers from the unit have been working directly with front-line troops to better understand real operational needs. Over the course of a year, they used individual pieces of collected data to build a unified situation map that reflects conditions on the ground.

“In the future, we will continue to maintain a close partnership with the military to better serve them,” Liu said. A senior figure in a quantum computing and supercomputing unit also stressed caution, saying “we must enhance our awareness of operational needs and maintain sensitivity in the use of technology”.

The article added that since its establishment, the unit has adapted to changes in warfare, technology, and adversaries. It said the team has “promoted the dynamic tracking, results sorting and practical application of cutting-edge technologies in the field of cybersecurity and information technology,” underscoring how quantum research is being tightly linked to real-world military use.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IE-Photo-22.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-15 12:56:27.976835

Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?","Force Master Chief PatrickPaul (PaP) C. Mangaran, command senior enlisted leader of the Defense Health Agency, brings more than 25 years of exemplary U.S. Navy service and leadership to the role, as well as an historic, multigenerational legacy of military service.

A native of Pittsburg, California, Mangaran enlisted in the U.S. Navy on Sept. 29, 1997, beginning a career grounded in clinical expertise, operational leadership, and a core value of generational mentorship.

From his early service as a medical laboratory technician to his appointment as force master chief, Mangaran’s career spans shipboard assignments, deployments with U.S. Marine Corps units, and multiple command master chief tours.

Mangaran hosted a spirited conversation with the DHA news team in his former office in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to reflect on his military career and distill his philosophy of leadership and readiness across the Military Health System.

Question: You come from a family with a rich history of service: Your father served 22 years as a hospital corpsman, and your maternal grandfather and great-grandfather served in wartime. How has that heroic legacy influenced your sense of duty and commitment to service?

Mangaran: I don’t see it as a heroic legacy. It’s just what we do; we serve this country. My father served most of his career as a lab tech and retired as a chief hospital corpsman. My maternal grandfather was an Army officer who trained Philippine guerilla fighters. My maternal great-grandfather was an Army combat medic who escaped after being captured and forced into the Bataan Death March. It’s because of them, their bravery and sacrifice, that I’m here today.

Question: Was there an experience early in your career that taught you about responsibility and leadership?

Mangaran: During my first few commands as a lab tech, I was mentored by some of the people my dad mentored. Their advice — to purposely get lost on the ship — helped me discover new spaces and understand how the ship operated while learning to think through solutions and connect dots. This set me up for success, especially when, as a senior NCO (noncommissioned officer), I found myself in charge of operations at a regimental aid station in Southern California. There were major fires in the area, and the senior chief couldn’t make it in. We had displaced families and Marines throughout the camp that needed medical care. The logistics were complex, and I worked for 72 hours straight, living on energy drinks, until I had to take a knee. Operations went on for a little over 96 hours. That was my defining moment as a chief petty officer. It took a lot of grit to press forward with so many unknowns, like building a plane while you’re flying it. I had to think outside the box and teach others to think outside their own boxes. Once it was over and I saw just how much my team had accomplished, I knew I could lead others through difficult situations. It also solidified for me that I had the ability to find solutions to whatever problems life threw at me.

Question: Looking back on your tours aboard the USS Constellation and USS Tarawa, were there any formative experiences during deployment that shaped your views on leadership and readiness?

Mangaran: Aboard the USS Constellation we got hit with a typical norovirus and had more than 100 patients come through medical. It felt like everyone was sick — even the medical team. Most of us had our own IV bags on while giving patients IVs. It was a crash course in direct patient care: The mission doesn’t change just because “Doc” is down. We have to take care of our warfighters. Period. For the rest of my deployment, I wasn’t just working in the lab. I was also conducting sick call, working on the flight deck as a leading petty officer, and taking care of the other corpsmen.

On USS Tarawa I took on a lot of collateral duty jobs. It was overwhelming and made me realize I needed to learn how to delegate. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, but I learned that I need to rely on my team, not just myself.

Question: How is your leadership style informed by that lesson of learning how to delegate responsibility?

Mangaran: When I feel compelled to jump in, usually because I’ve seen a specific situation before and want to help, I remind myself that even if I did something a certain way in the past, it might not be the right way to do it today. Leadership is situational.

The year my now 17-year-old son was born, I was the leading chief petty officer (staff noncommissioned officer in charge) of Navy Education and Training Office for 1st Marine Division. He had some medical issues that required multiple hospital visits and hospitalizations during the first few months of his life. I had to lean on my team in order to be physically present with my son during that time. They helped facilitate the combat trauma medicine training and professional development courses we were running, as well as a train-the-trainer course for other chief petty officers on base. Technology allowed me to stay in touch with the team (this was back when we carried Blackberrys) and every course was completed successfully. It was an important lesson in trusting others to get the job done and ensuring my team felt empowered to carry on with the mission in my absence.

Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?

Mangaran: Beating the drum on our purpose: keeping the warfighter in the fight, keeping our medical teams in the fight, keeping ourselves in the fight. Our deployable warfighters are our priority. We can’t focus on large-scale combat operations if we can’t get warfighters out the door. Whatever your job is, master it. No matter where you are in the organization, it takes all of us working together to meet our military medical mission. I’d also like to see us leverage technology, like AI (artificial intelligence), to increase access to care.

Question: You’ve described your leadership philosophy as R.E.A.L — Relevant, Engaged, Aligned, Listening, Learning, and Leading. How does each component apply to your day-to-day leadership?",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9480156.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-15 16:56:22.419368

“We educate leaders to integrate resources, economics and strategy in support of national security,” said Stacey Pilling, DLA’s faculty chair at the school.
“Sometimes, when we're working on products or on a solution to a problem, we don't fully understand the thinking of our senior leaders,” he said.
“DLA is developing senior leaders and strengthening the agency with as many forward-thinking people as possible,” Wood said.","Three current Defense Logistics Agency employees are gaining a new perspective on global logistics and leadership as students at the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy.

The 10-month program at the National Defense University is designed to create senior leaders who can navigate the complexities of global logistics. Its curriculum sets it apart from other senior service colleges.

“We educate leaders to integrate resources, economics and strategy in support of national security,” said Stacey Pilling, DLA’s faculty chair at the school. “We can have all the strategy in the world, but how do we get the resourcing part of it? We’re the only war college that focuses on that.”

The focus on the industrial base and economics is a key takeaway for students.

David Wood, a DLA liaison officer for the Defense Health Agency, said he’s learning about how economics drive national security, global partnerships and domestic policies.

Beyond the curriculum, students said the program’s greatest strength lies in the range of its cohort, which includes U.S. and foreign military, civilians across the federal government, and fellows from private industry.

Marcus Miller, a DLA Logistics Operations strategy analyst, said his interest in the program was in part due to the inclusion of industry-based fellows. He said the industry attendance and input makes the experience vastly different from the other war colleges.

The mix of backgrounds is one of the most rewarding aspects of the program for Kevin Phillips, a DLA Logistics Operations strategic analyst. He described the atmosphere as exhilarating and demanding.

“It’s designed to further diversify our thought process and challenge our own assumptions in how we’ve done business in the past,” Phillips said.

For Miller, he said the program has provided insight into the thinking of senior leaders.

“Sometimes, when we're working on products or on a solution to a problem, we don't fully understand the thinking of our senior leaders,” he said. “I think this gives a baseline for emerging leaders to not only move up in the organization, but to really start understanding how the senior leaders in DLA think and operate,” Miller said.

This sentiment was echoed by Wood, who said the program is about building a stronger agency.

“DLA is developing senior leaders and strengthening the agency with as many forward-thinking people as possible,” Wood said. “It's more than just an individual going to school; it's about what we can do to provide support to the services and the warfighters as quickly and as intelligently as possible.”",https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/15/2003856800/1920/1080/0/260115-D-D0441-1001.JPG,N,0.0,2026-01-15 09:56:32.918450

Most recently, he was the medical center director for the West Texas VA Health Care System, providing care for over 24,000 veterans.
In his new role, he acknowledges the significant challenges facing the Military Health System (MHS), particularly regarding medical readiness amid limited resources and escalating health care costs.
His immediate goal is to implement a comprehensive policy that improves access to mental health care.","A retired Navy commander has officially stepped into the role of the Defense Department’s top medical leader after being sworn in as the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Keith Bass, previously the director of the White House Medical Unit and a health care executive at the Department of Veterans Affairs, will oversee health policy and budgeting for the Military Health System, which serves approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries, including active-duty personnel, veterans, and their families.

In his new capacity, Bass is tasked with directing the Defense Health Agency and serving as the chief medical adviser to the secretary of defense. He expressed his commitment to creating a seamless and high-quality healthcare experience for service members and their families, both during and after their time in uniform. “From their first day of service to their last, and continuing to care for them as veterans,” he emphasized his dedication to improving the health care system.

During his confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee, Bass outlined his top priorities, which include enhancing medical readiness and stabilizing the health care system to ensure advanced care is available both on and off the battlefield. Mental health and suicide prevention are also critical areas of focus, particularly in the context of growing concerns in recent years.

Bass has a storied career in the military, with 20 years of service that began as an enlisted sailor and culminated in his promotion to the rank of commander. His extensive experience includes roles on humanitarian missions, serving in military treatment facilities, and holding positions within the CIA and the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Notably, he was the CIA’s first nonphysician director of the Office of Medical Services and served as the medical unit director at the White House from 2013 to 2019, overseeing medical care for the highest levels of government leadership.

Most recently, he was the medical center director for the West Texas VA Health Care System, providing care for over 24,000 veterans. In his new role, he acknowledges the significant challenges facing the Military Health System (MHS), particularly regarding medical readiness amid limited resources and escalating health care costs.

Among the pressing issues cited by Bass are ongoing medical personnel shortages and complications from the new Tricare contracts, which have led to difficulties for patients in accessing specialty care and other medical services. He intends to focus on monitoring access to care, improving referral management, and enhancing the adequacy of the Tricare provider network. Additionally, he supports the Department of Defense’s directive to reattract at least 7% of Tricare beneficiaries back to military treatment facilities for direct care by the year’s end.

Bass has committed to evaluating staffing levels across military treatment facilities and ensuring that Department of Defense policies enhance manpower requirements. In addressing long-term medical personnel shortages, he will need to judiciously allocate resources to optimize care delivery. He has highlighted the urgent need for expanded mental health resources, advocating for greater telehealth capabilities for both active-duty members and veterans. His immediate goal is to implement a comprehensive policy that improves access to mental health care.

As Bass takes on this pivotal leadership role, the focus remains on transforming the Military Health System to better serve those who have dedicated their lives to military service.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Retired-Navy-Commander-Keith-Bass-Sworn-in-as-Defense-Departments.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-15 09:56:42.575542

TBI field assessment tools are designed to give frontline providers accurate information faster to help shape treatment decisions before, during, and after medevac post-injury, according to U.S. Army Capt.","Team members with the Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office joined dozens of U.S. Navy corpsmen and medical officers at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, this week as part of an end-user touchpoint here, Jan. 14, 2026.

The event was designed to collect feedback from clinical and frontline U.S. Navy medical providers to shape the development of traumatic brain injury detection devices as part of OPMED’s TBI Field Assessment Program. Traumatic brain injuries, caused by exposure to concussive events like roadside bombs and indirect fire, are a significant threat to frontline service members. There have been more than 505,000 traumatic brain injuries reported within the Department of War since 2000, ranging from mild to severe. Many TBIs are not accompanied by exterior signs of injury yet can have both short and long-term health effects. In TBI cases, identifying internal injuries, like intercranial hemorrhage or other non-visible brain damage, is a vital first step to ensuring injured personnel receive proper treatment across the continuum of care.

During the touchpoint, corpsmen and medical officers from across Marine Corps and Navy commands in the Eastern North Carolina region provided feedback on brain trauma assessment devices currently under development at OPMED. The TBI FAP program is managed by brain health experts belonging to OPMED’s Warfighter Readiness, Performance, and Brain Health Project Management Office and their partners with the North Carolina Center for Optimizing Military Performance.

The event, hosted at the Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, was designed to gather feedback on TBI assessment technology prototypes in development for use in a far-forward, operational environment. Feedback from prospective end users is a vital step in the early development of any program, according to Damien Hoffman, a product manager with WRPBH.

“Collaborating with stakeholders across the military services and from key organizations in a systematic, routine way is imperative to our team’s success,” said Hoffman. “These touchpoints allow us to gather an array of feedback from end users with varying degrees of experience and expertise, an invaluable resource as we develop products for the Warfighter.”

The U.S. Navy provides medical care and services for the Marine Corps. During the touchpoint, volunteer corpsmen and medical officers participated in prototype device demonstrations and focus groups. The event was designed to capture Service-unique needs and assess potential integration and utilization of brain trauma assessment devicesin the prehospital setting, particularly at Role 1 (battalion aid station) and Role 2 (brigade level) care facilities. Participants provided feedback about the devices’ ease of use, design features, and overall fitness for use in austere, remote environments.

“Our process is a continuum, with flexibility to evolve alongside emerging threats and meet the needs of frontline Warfighters, combatant commands, and joint staff,” Hoffman added. “Our goal is to rapidly develop a TBI assessment capability at the speed of relevance, and these touchpoints are imperative to achieving that goal.”

The WRPBH TBI assessment programs are designed to develop devices that are rugged, deployable, cost-effective, and user-friendly in the hands of medical providers as close to the point of injury as possible. TBI field assessment tools are designed to give frontline providers accurate information faster to help shape treatment decisions before, during, and after medevac post-injury, according to U.S. Army Capt. Matthew D'Alessandro, an assistant product manager and research psychologist with WRPBH.

“With the evolving nature of conflict, it is our mission to keep pace technologically to enable Warfighter lethality as they prepare for future operations in places like the Indo-Pacific,” said D'Alessandro. “What that means in principle for our team is that we use a multi-avenue approach to finding solutions that fill current and future capability gaps for brain health treatment at and near the front lines.

“With TBI FAP, we have identified a capability gap – in this case, the lack of a near instantaneous brain injury assessment capability – and are working to identify candidate technologies that are commercially available or nearing wide availability. This strategic approach prepares us to meet the needs of combatant commands more rapidly than previous development models.”

During future conflicts, with logistics and evacuation capabilities limited by distance and austerity found in regions like the Arctic and Indo-Pacific, the “Golden Hour” may not be a feasible amount of time to move injured and wounded to higher care facilities. To answer the TBI treatment challenges presented by possible future conflicts in remote locations, the OPMED team works to develop new capabilities and improve tested treatments to meet the needs of tomorrow’s Warfighters, said D'Alessandro.

“Assessing the presence of brain traumas to indicate their severity without needing to move a patient to a higher care facility gives commanders on the ground more options to mitigate the challenges of distance and time,” he said. “Future conflicts will present novel challenges for combatant commanders and troops on the ground, and programs like TBI FAP will help mitigate those challenges to help keep our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines healthy and in the fight.”

Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained.
He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""","Fifteen Defense Health Agency facilities earned top marks from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for how well they prepare patients to leave the hospital, according to an analysis by Becker’s Hospital Review.

The report identified 15 military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating for “Care Transitions” from CMS. The rating reflects how patients judged their discharge planning and follow-up instructions after an inpatient stay — a critical time in the patient care journey, said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA deputy assistant director, medical affairs.

“A five-star CMS rating in care transitions shows our teams exceed national benchmarks during one of the most risk-prone moments in care,” he said, noting that strong care coordination, teamwork, and patient-centered discharge planning led to the CMS recognition.

CMS listed hospital and clinic ratings based on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, asking patients about their experience during a recent inpatient hospital stay. Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days. The survey was completed between October 2023 and September 2024, and data was updated July 16, 2025.

Awarded military hospitals and clinics

The DHA military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating from CMS included:

60th Medical Group, Travis Air Force Base, California

96th Medical Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi

88th Medical Group, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

99th Medical Group, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

Cordts said the recognition demonstrates the agency’s commitment to operational readiness: “By taking superior care of the patient, the DHA also takes care of the warfighter.”

Measuring patient experience

CMS scored hospitals and clinics through a survey asking patients to rate their health care experience through three key components:

During this hospital stay, staff took my preferences and those of my family or caregiver into account in deciding what my health care needs would be when I left.

When I left the hospital, I clearly understood the purpose for taking each of my medications.

Dr. Kristen Atterbury, DHA chief nursing officer, said those questions showed patients understood what to do after hospitalization — such as how to manage recovery, take medications correctly, and follow instructions — that can reduce complications and avoidable readmissions. “When we do those three things well, we empower patients, improve safety, and build trust,” she said.

Sharing decision-making, clearly communicating responsibilities, and thorough medication education are “cornerstones of a safe and positive patient experience,” while helping relieve the burden of recovering from injury and illness, Atterbury said. “A stressed and distracted service member is not a ready one.”

Aligning with DHA lines of effort

Cordts and Atterbury said the recognition correlates directly with DHA’s priorities of combat support, care reattraction, and enterprise services optimization.

Combat support “helps the force stay ready. A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.

Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained. He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""

Enterprise services optimization “uses what works and spreading it across the whole system,” Atterbury said. “The goal is to take strong steps — such as good discharge checklists and follow-up calls — and use them everywhere. This creates a standardized playbook for excellence, optimizing performance, reducing unwanted variation, and elevating the quality of care across the entire enterprise.”

The award gives DHA the opportunity to share best practices across the MHS, using patient feedback to refine discharge planning, medication counseling, and follow-up coordination — equipping warfighters to stay healthy while continuing recovery at home. This phase of the patient care journey can be vital to stay ready, said Atterbury. “A stable, and well-supported family at home enables a focused, mission-ready force in the field.”

Ultimately, the high marks received from CMS demonstrate DHA’s commitment to mission readiness, said Cordts.

“Excelling at care transitions is a strategic linchpin for the DHA,” he said. “It simultaneously enhances warfighter readiness by ensuring family well-being, attracts patients back to the direct care system, and provides a blueprint for system-wide improvement that is central to enterprise optimization.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9124347.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-15 07:56:55.341104

Starting Jan. 20, you’ll be able to access lab results, radiology reports, pathology reports, and clinical notes immediately through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal. MHS GENESIS will release your electronic health information the moment it enters the system. This change is a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, a federal law that gives you faster access to your health information.

“This change puts you in control of your health care,” said Dr. Paul Doan, Chief, Specialty Care Policy Support, at the Defense Health Agency. “You’ll get your results sooner, which helps you ask your health care team better questions and decide the care that’s best for you or your family.”

What this means for you

Starting Jan. 20, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal will send you a notification when new results or notes are available. Sometimes, this may mean you see your results before your care team reviews them. You’ll need to verify that an active email account is associated with your patient portal to get these notifications. Check your settings to verify your email address.

When you log in to view results, you’ll see a banner. The banner will explain that your provider or care team may not have reviewed them yet. Your provider will contact you if your results need further discussion or explanation.

What you should know

Results appear quickly. The system releases information right away. You might see your results before your provider does. Your provider will reach out about anything that requires immediate attention. If you have any questions about your results, contact your provider.

Take time to review. Read your results carefully. The patient portal may include explanations for certain values or findings. Reach out to your provider or care team if something confuses you or seems unexpected.

Some results may be sensitive. You might view emotionally difficult results before speaking with your provider. Your provider or care team can walk you through what the findings mean and discuss next steps.

You can choose when to view your results. Do you want to discuss results with your provider first? You can wait to open them in the patient portal until your provider contacts you or until your next visit.

Why this change matters

Federal law requires health systems to give patients real-time access to their electronic health information. This change improves transparency. It enables faster, more informed conversations about your care. You gain more control over your health information.

Tooth decay is still one of the most common health problems worldwide, especially in children and teenagers. According to the World Health Organization, around 60–90% of school-aged children globally experience dental cavities. In the UK, NHS data shows that tooth decay remains the leading cause of hospital admissions for children aged 6–10.

The problem usually begins in the back teeth.

Molars and premolars have deep grooves on their chewing surfaces. These grooves trap food and bacteria. Even with regular brushing, it is difficult for toothbrush bristles to reach these narrow areas. Over time, plaque builds up, acids form, and enamel starts breaking down.

Parents often believe that brushing twice a day is enough. Many adults assume they are doing everything right. But cavities do not always cause pain at the start. By the time discomfort appears, damage has already occurred.

This is where most decay quietly begins—out of sight and untreated.

Impact: Untreated Grooves Turn Into Costly Dental Problems

When food and bacteria stay trapped in tooth grooves, decay progresses faster than expected. Studies show that the chewing surfaces of molars account for nearly 80% of cavities in children, even though these surfaces represent a much smaller portion of the tooth.

Once decay starts, treatment becomes unavoidable.

A small cavity can turn into a filling. A deeper cavity may need root canal treatment. In severe cases, extraction becomes the only option. For children, this can mean missed school days, dental anxiety, and hospital visits under general anaesthesia. For adults, it often means higher treatment costs and long-term oral health issues.

The financial impact is also significant. NHS reports indicate that treating preventable tooth decay costs the UK healthcare system hundreds of millions of pounds every year. Most of these cases could have been avoided with early preventive care.

The frustrating part?

Tooth decay in grooves is largely preventable. Yet many people are never told about simple preventive options that could protect their teeth for years.

Solution: Dental Sealants Offer Proven Protection

Dental sealants are thin protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of back teeth. They work by sealing deep grooves and pits where food and bacteria usually collect. Once sealed, these areas become smooth and easier to clean.

The process is quick, painless, and non-invasive.

No drilling is involved. No tooth structure is removed. The tooth is cleaned, dried, and the sealant material is painted onto the surface. A special light hardens the material within seconds. The entire procedure usually takes just a few minutes per tooth.

What Does the Evidence Say?

Dental sealants are not a new concept. They have been studied for decades, and the results are consistent.

A Cochrane Review, one of the most trusted sources for healthcare evidence, found that sealants reduce the risk of decay in molars by up to 80% in the first two years after application. Even after four years, sealed teeth showed significantly fewer cavities compared to unsealed teeth.

Another long-term study published in the Journal of Dental Research followed children with sealed molars over nine years. The study reported that sealed teeth had 65% fewer cavities than unsealed teeth, even when regular brushing habits were similar.

These findings confirm one thing: sealants work.

Who Should Consider Dental Sealants?

Dental sealants are most commonly recommended for children and teenagers, but they are not limited to younger age groups.

Children and Teenagers

Permanent molars usually erupt between the ages of 6 and 12. This is when teeth are most vulnerable. Applying sealants soon after eruption offers maximum protection during high-risk years.

Public Health England supports sealant use as part of preventive dental care for children, especially those at higher risk of decay.

Adults

Adults with deep grooves, early signs of enamel wear, or a history of cavities can also benefit. Sealants can be applied to adult teeth as long as there is no existing decay.

Patients with High Decay Risk

People with dry mouth, orthodontic appliances, or difficulty maintaining oral hygiene may benefit more from sealants than brushing alone.

How Long Do Dental Sealants Last?

Dental sealants are durable but not permanent.

Most sealants last 5 to 10 years, depending on biting forces, oral habits, and regular dental check-ups. Dentists routinely check sealants during examinations and can repair or replace them if needed.

Even partially retained sealants still offer protection, as long as some coverage remains in the grooves.

The cost of maintaining sealants is far lower than treating cavities later.

Are Dental Sealants Safe?

Yes. Dental sealants have been widely used and studied for over 40 years.

Concerns have occasionally been raised about trace BPA exposure. However, multiple studies, including reviews by the American Dental Association and Public Health England, confirm that exposure from sealants is extremely low and well below safety limits.

The preventive benefits clearly outweigh any minimal risk.

Dental Sealants vs Fillings: Prevention Beats Repair

A filling repairs damage after decay has occurred. A sealant prevents that damage from happening in the first place.

Once a tooth is filled, it will always require maintenance. Fillings can wear out, crack, or need replacement. Each replacement removes more natural tooth structure.

Sealants protect the original tooth surface and delay or eliminate the need for future treatment.

From a long-term perspective, prevention always wins.

Dental Sealants and TRICARE: Common Questions from Military Families

Preventive treatments like dental sealants are especially valuable for families who want to avoid unexpected dental problems and treatment delays. For patients covered under TRICARE, a few practical questions often come up before booking an appointment.

Do you accept TRICARE?

Yes. We welcome TRICARE patients and US military families.

The Thatch Dental Practice is an official TRICARE Overseas Preferred Provider in the UK, working closely with United Concordia to support eligible patients.

Will TRICARE cover all of my treatment?

TRICARE coverage depends on your individual plan and the type of treatment required. Before starting any treatment, we clearly explain your options and discuss expected costs so you can make an informed decision.

For treatments that are covered, claims are submitted directly to TRICARE/United Concordia. In most cases, you do not need to pay us directly.

Can you help with paperwork and claims?

Yes. Our experienced team manages the administrative process for you. We submit claims on your behalf and provide any required clinical notes or documentation, so you do not need to handle paperwork yourself.

I have toothache — can I be seen urgently?

Yes. If you are experiencing pain or discomfort, please contact us and we will do our best to offer the earliest appropriate appointment.

You can email patient.coordinator@thethatchdental.co.uk or use the chatbot on our website for quick assistance.

Do you see children and families?

Yes. We provide dental care for both adults and children. This includes routine check-ups, preventive care such as dental sealants, and ongoing oral health support for the whole family.

I’m new to the UK — will the process be complicated?

Not at all. We regularly support patients who are new to the UK or newly posted to the area. Our team guides you step by step and helps ensure smooth and timely access to dental care.

Final Thoughts: Small Step, Big Impact

Dental sealants are one of the most effective preventive tools in modern dentistry. They are quick to apply, affordable, and backed by strong scientific evidence.

Yet many people still miss out on this protection simply because they are unaware of it.

If cavities keep appearing despite good brushing habits, or if a child is getting permanent teeth, sealants should be part of the conversation. Preventive care today can save years of treatment later.

Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?","Force Master Chief PatrickPaul (PaP) C. Mangaran, command senior enlisted leader of the Defense Health Agency, brings more than 25 years of exemplary U.S. Navy service and leadership to the role, as well as an historic, multigenerational legacy of military service.

A native of Pittsburg, California, Mangaran enlisted in the U.S. Navy on Sept. 29, 1997, beginning a career grounded in clinical expertise, operational leadership, and a core value of generational mentorship.

From his early service as a medical laboratory technician to his appointment as force master chief, Mangaran’s career spans shipboard assignments, deployments with U.S. Marine Corps units, and multiple command master chief tours.

Mangaran hosted a spirited conversation with the DHA news team in his former office in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to reflect on his military career and distill his philosophy of leadership and readiness across the Military Health System.

Question: You come from a family with a rich history of service: Your father served 22 years as a hospital corpsman, and your maternal grandfather and great-grandfather served in wartime. How has that heroic legacy influenced your sense of duty and commitment to service?

Mangaran: I don’t see it as a heroic legacy. It’s just what we do; we serve this country. My father served most of his career as a lab tech and retired as a chief hospital corpsman. My maternal grandfather was an Army officer who trained Philippine guerilla fighters. My maternal great-grandfather was an Army combat medic who escaped after being captured and forced into the Bataan Death March. It’s because of them, their bravery and sacrifice, that I’m here today.

Question: Was there an experience early in your career that taught you about responsibility and leadership?

Mangaran: During my first few commands as a lab tech, I was mentored by some of the people my dad mentored. Their advice — to purposely get lost on the ship — helped me discover new spaces and understand how the ship operated while learning to think through solutions and connect dots. This set me up for success, especially when, as a senior NCO (noncommissioned officer), I found myself in charge of operations at a regimental aid station in Southern California. There were major fires in the area, and the senior chief couldn’t make it in. We had displaced families and Marines throughout the camp that needed medical care. The logistics were complex, and I worked for 72 hours straight, living on energy drinks, until I had to take a knee. Operations went on for a little over 96 hours. That was my defining moment as a chief petty officer. It took a lot of grit to press forward with so many unknowns, like building a plane while you’re flying it. I had to think outside the box and teach others to think outside their own boxes. Once it was over and I saw just how much my team had accomplished, I knew I could lead others through difficult situations. It also solidified for me that I had the ability to find solutions to whatever problems life threw at me.

Question: Looking back on your tours aboard the USS Constellation and USS Tarawa, were there any formative experiences during deployment that shaped your views on leadership and readiness?

Mangaran: Aboard the USS Constellation we got hit with a typical norovirus and had more than 100 patients come through medical. It felt like everyone was sick — even the medical team. Most of us had our own IV bags on while giving patients IVs. It was a crash course in direct patient care: The mission doesn’t change just because “Doc” is down. We have to take care of our warfighters. Period. For the rest of my deployment, I wasn’t just working in the lab. I was also conducting sick call, working on the flight deck as a leading petty officer, and taking care of the other corpsmen.

On USS Tarawa I took on a lot of collateral duty jobs. It was overwhelming and made me realize I needed to learn how to delegate. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, but I learned that I need to rely on my team, not just myself.

Question: How is your leadership style informed by that lesson of learning how to delegate responsibility?

Mangaran: When I feel compelled to jump in, usually because I’ve seen a specific situation before and want to help, I remind myself that even if I did something a certain way in the past, it might not be the right way to do it today. Leadership is situational.

The year my now 17-year-old son was born, I was the leading chief petty officer (staff noncommissioned officer in charge) of Navy Education and Training Office for 1st Marine Division. He had some medical issues that required multiple hospital visits and hospitalizations during the first few months of his life. I had to lean on my team in order to be physically present with my son during that time. They helped facilitate the combat trauma medicine training and professional development courses we were running, as well as a train-the-trainer course for other chief petty officers on base. Technology allowed me to stay in touch with the team (this was back when we carried Blackberrys) and every course was completed successfully. It was an important lesson in trusting others to get the job done and ensuring my team felt empowered to carry on with the mission in my absence.

Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?

Mangaran: Beating the drum on our purpose: keeping the warfighter in the fight, keeping our medical teams in the fight, keeping ourselves in the fight. Our deployable warfighters are our priority. We can’t focus on large-scale combat operations if we can’t get warfighters out the door. Whatever your job is, master it. No matter where you are in the organization, it takes all of us working together to meet our military medical mission. I’d also like to see us leverage technology, like AI (artificial intelligence), to increase access to care.

Working to achieve Leapfrog standards aligns with our overall commitment to Ready Reliable Care.

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program allows all participating hospitals to benchmark their safety efforts on a national level.Updated twice per year, the grades evaluate 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety and make it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

In the Fall 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an ""A""grade.

“Earning the top grade among America’s participating hospitals is truly a team effort; this recognition is not earned by a small number of leaders, but truly the entire organization,” said BAMC Commander U.S. Army Col. Kevin Kelly. “Considering that the grade includes 22 evidence-based measures, there are many processes that must be monitored by many people and adhered to by many more to achieve this top grade.”

Even something as simple as proper hand washing can make a significant impact on preventing infection.

“These ratings underscore the strength of our integrated military health system and the unwavering commitment of our teams to safe, high-quality care,” said Maj. Gen.

Unequal standards of care based on age move military healthcare backward.
This is the moment to ensure retiree healthcare is not treated as a legacy system scheduled for decommissioning.","A recent TRICARE policy change has ended coverage of certain weight-loss drugs for Medicare-eligible military retirees.

This policy sets a precedent that could allow for future denials of other expensive treatments for retirees.

The author calls for action as the 2027 defense budget is being drafted to protect retiree healthcare promises.

In the mid-1990s, I stood on test ranges with the ARDEC research and development team, documenting the birth of the Modular Artillery Charge System. Our job was simple in concept but critical in practice: eliminate unreliable systems, reduce risk and make sure soldiers had what they needed when it mattered most.

Later, producing Army training media at MANSCEN and supporting readiness operations for the 82nd Airborne Division, my mission remained the same — turn complexity into clarity so warfighters could execute without administrative friction.

Today, as a military retiree, I see that same dangerous friction creeping into our healthcare system.

The TRICARE victory we thought was final was only a truce.

Many of us believed the battle for retiree healthcare was settled in 2001 with the creation of TRICARE For Life. But as we enter 2026, new battle lines have quietly been drawn.

When budgets tighten, the Department of Defense has historically looked inward for savings. In the late 1980s, base medical facilities were closed. In the 1990s, retirees over age 65 were excluded from TRICARE. It took a Medal of Honor recipient — Colonel Bud Day — and a federal lawsuit to restore the promise of healthcare for life.

We believed that victory was final.

It turns out it was only a truce.

On August 31, 2025, the Defense Health Agency implemented what TRICARE described as “regulatory controls,” ending coverage of GLP-1 medications for TRICARE For Life beneficiaries when prescribed for obesity. At the same time, retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime or Select retained a pathway to coverage.

The result is a two-tiered system — one standard of care for working-age retirees, another for Medicare-eligible retirees. Not based on medical judgment. Based on plan classification tied to age.

We are potentially moving military healthcare backward.

Some may say this concerns only one class of medication. But anyone who has worked in testing, doctrine or acquisition knows that small skirmishes are often proof-of-concept for larger operations. Once a precedent exists to deny a medically recognized treatment to one retiree population, the mechanism is in place to repeat it.

If this stands, what happens when the next breakthrough treatment for cardiac disease, diabetes or cancer carries a high price tag? Who decides which retirees qualify?

The Defense Health Agency explains this decision as statutory alignment. But statutes creating TRICARE For Life were written to protect retiree benefits — not to serve as tools to carve them away.

Unequal standards of care based on age move military healthcare backward. They erode trust in the system and signal to those still serving that promised benefits can be redefined later.

'For life' was a promise.

In Army training and system development, we never accepted a design that failed the end user. We demanded correction before fielding. We should demand no less now.

The first drafts of the 2027 Defense Budget are being written today. This is the moment to ensure retiree healthcare is not treated as a legacy system scheduled for decommissioning.

“For Life” was a promise.

Promises to those who serve should not expire.

This change is a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, a federal law that gives you faster access to your health information.

“This change puts you in control of your health care,” said Dr. Paul Doan, Chief, Specialty Care Policy Support, at the Defense Health Agency.“You’ll get your results sooner, which helps you ask your health care team better questions and decide the care that’s best for you or your family.”

What this means for you Starting Jan. 20, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal will send you a notification when new results or notes are available. Sometimes, this may mean you see your results before your care team reviews them. You’ll need to verify that an active email account is associated with your patient portal to get these notifications. Check your settings to verify your email address.

When you log in to view results, you’ll see a banner. The banner will explain that your provider or care team may not have reviewed them yet. Your provider will contact you if your results need further discussion or explanation.

What you should know · Results appear quickly. The system releases information right away. You might see your results before your provider does. Your provider will reach out about anything that requires immediate attention. If you have any questions about your results, contact your provider. · Take time to review. Read your results carefully. The patient portal may include explanations for certain values or findings. Reach out to your provider or care team if something confuses you or seems unexpected. · Some results may be sensitive. You might view emotionally difficult results before speaking with your provider. Your provider or care team can walk you through what the findings mean and discuss next steps. · You can choose when to view your results. Do you want to discuss results with your provider first? You can wait to open them in the patient portal until your provider contacts you or until your next visit.

Why this change matters Federal law requires health systems to give patients real-time access to their electronic health information. This change improves transparency. It enables faster, more informed conversations about your care. You gain more control over your health information.

Questions? Reach out to your provider or care team for context, next steps, or follow-up care. They’re here to help you understand your results and support you through your health care journey.

The defendant took issue with the jury’s finding that he lacked intent for his conspiracy charge but not the substantive Anti-Kickback charges.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction of the co-owner of a pharmacy for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, finding that the government presented sufficient evidence at trial to show the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful. The court also upheld the defendant’s sentencing, finding no clear error in the district court’s application of the sentencing guidelines (U.S. v. Copeland, No. 23-13888 (11th Cir. Jan. 9, 2026)).

Scheme. The defendant was a co-owner of a pharmacy specializing in expensive compounded prescription pain and scar creams, Florida Pharmacy Solutions, Inc. (FPS). FPS produced the creams and marketed them to beneficiaries of TRICARE, which would reimburse FPS. In May 2020, the defendant was charged with one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and to receive and pay health care kickbacks; two counts of receiving health care kickbacks; and three counts of paying health care kickbacks. The indictment alleged that the defendant and others associated with FPS would, using direct and indirect payments of bribes and kickbacks, solicit medical providers to prescribe FPS’s creams to TRICARE beneficiaries. TRICARE would pay for the prescriptions, and FPS would pay kickbacks to the defendant and others.

Appeal. The defendant presented four arguments on appeal: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the five substantive counts, as he was acquitted of the conspiracy count, which demonstrates an inconsistency in the jury’s verdicts; (2) the district court erred in finding the defendant qualified for an aggravating role enhancement; (3) the district court erred in finding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he was not a zero-point offender; and (4) the district court erred in finding the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he did not clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility over his offenses. The Eleventh Circuit disagreed with the defendant on each issue and affirmed his convictions and the sentence.

Five substantive counts. The defendant argued that, because the jury found he did not have specific intent to support the conspiracy count, it follows that he did not have the requisite mens rea to support the jury’s verdicts as to the five substantive counts. To establish eligibility for plain-error relief, the defendant must satisfy three threshold requirements: (1) he must establish there was an error; (2) he must establish that the error was plain; and (3) the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. If the first three requirements are satisfied, a court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The defendant has the burden to establish all four requirements; satisfying all four prongs of the plain-error test is difficult, the court noted.

The Eleventh Circuit found the defendant had not carried the burden of establishing that there was a manifest miscarriage of justice. He argued that the government must prove he knew his conduct specifically violated the Anti-Kickback statute. However, the government presented sufficient evidence at trial to show the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful. Notably, the defendant’s contract with FPS required him to comply with applicable laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. He participated in and passed two compliance training courses. The government further showed that the defendant specifically knew about and authorized various events in which medical providers were induced with various benefits to prescribe FPS’s compounded cream prescriptions for TRICARE beneficiaries. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit found the defendant had not carried his burden of establishing that the jury’s verdict as to the five substantive counts was not supported by sufficient evidence.

Sentencing. The Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court’s sentencing analysis, finding no clear error in its application of the sentencing guidelines. The court concluded that the defendant qualified for a three-level aggravating role enhancement because he was a co-owner of the pharmacy and supervised a sales team and because the scheme involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. This enhancement also disqualified him from receiving a reduction as a zero-point offender. Additionally, the court affirmed the denial of a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, noting that the defendant went to trial and contested his guilt, which generally precludes such an adjustment. Overall, the district court properly calculated the offense level and imposed a below-guidelines sentence of 51 months’ imprisonment.

The case is No. 23-13888.

Judge: Per curiam.

Attorneys: Brendan B. Gants, U.S. Department of Justice, for the U.S. David Elbert Little (Brown Doherty Little) for David Byron Copeland.
