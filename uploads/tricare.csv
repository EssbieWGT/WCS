His insights into the program’s funding mechanisms and his understanding of the demographics associated with the current and future participants in this critical senior program were the origin of Association’s position, resulting in the AMAC Social Security Guarantee.

The Social Security Guarantee (SSG) has undergone several iterations since its 2014 creation, each time adjusting the components to accommodate evolving conditions. Most recently, AMAC convened a dedicated working group to evaluate Social Security’s worsening financial trajectory and recommend changes to the SSG that would lead to its preservation and its modernization to meet the challenges of 21st Century economics. This process examined many proposed solutions presented in recent Trustees Reports and selected the alternatives felt to be best suited to save Social Security’s retirement trust fund. These proposals have been combined with our own research to achieve what we believe to be the best path to long-term trust fund solvency without the necessity of tax increases.

A summary of the current AMAC Social Security Guarantee can be viewed on the AMAC.us website. The full SSG research paper and recommendations can be downloaded from that site.

In 2013, AMAC—The Association of Mature American Citizens—took a big step with the creation of the AMAC Foundation, Inc., a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit entity designed to serve Americans. The Foundation’s mission is to help protect and ensure the financial security, health, and social lives of current and future mature Americans, and to help Americans navigate the bewildering array of decisions they need to make.

The Foundation’s projects and plans include providing factual information that improves understanding of the positive value of Social Security and Medicare and the current and long-term challenges these programs face, as well as providing interpretations by Certified Social Security Advisors through AMAC publications, workshops, webinars, podcasts, and telephone support.

In addition, the Foundation serves all Americans in a variety of capacities, including provision of a source of education on the principles of American Free Enterprise, long-term retirement financial planning, and preparing for life—and potential employment—after retirement.

Back to top Sources [1] nida.nih.gov [2] www.tricare.mil [3] www.tricare.mil [4] www.tricare.mil","Substance abuse is a common issue among active soldiers and veterans. The stress and trauma that are part of military life can often cause personnel to turn to drugs or alcohol. Studies have shown that one in ten veterans are diagnosed with substance use disorder, a slightly higher proportion than the general population [1]. In an attempt to aid the recovery of military personnel and veterans, and help them and their families lead healthy, productive lives, the government established Tricare insurance. Tricare offers multi-tiered coverage for medical treatment for active military, veterans and their dependents. In this article, Avenues Recovery shares guidance on eligibility and treatment options covered by Tricare, including Tricare substance abuse coverage.

What Treatment Types Does Tricare Cover?

Included in the long list of Tricare-covered treatment are the following [2]:

Applied Behavior Analysis

Autism Spectrum Disorder

Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy

Collateral Visits

Drug Testing

Eating Disorder Treatment

Electroconvulsive Therapy

Family Therapy

Gender Dysphoria

Intensive Outpatient Programs

Inpatient Hospital Services (emergency and non-emergency)

Management of Withdrawal Symptoms (Detoxification)

Medication Assisted Treatment

Office Based Opioid Treatment

Opioid Treatment Programs

Partial Hospitalization program

Psychoanalysis

Psychological Testing

Psychotherapy

Psychotropic Drugs

Residential Treatment Facility Care

Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Therapeutic Services

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

Conditions such as PTSD, depression, and all forms of addictions are covered by Tricare plans as well.

Locations for Tricare Insurance

Tricare is available across the globe [3]. Its management is split into three different regions.

Tricare West includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa (excludes Rock Island arsenal area), Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri (except St. Louis area), Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas (southwestern corner including El Paso), Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

Tricare healthcare plans in this region are administered by Health Net. This means that Health Net serves as the contractor to the government to provide access and benefits to the end users, in this case active military personnel, veterans, and their dependents. They provide networks, claims processing, and education.

Tricare East includes, Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa (Rock Island area), Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri (St. Louis area), New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas (excluding El Paso area), Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

The contracting partner for the eastern region is Humana Military.

Anywhere outside the United States is called the overseas region, and is managed by International SOS.

Tricare Plans and Eligibility

Tricare offers several different plans, each with unique eligibility, benefits and costs. A common question we get asked is “does Tricare cover therapy for dependants of military personnel?”, and the answer is yes. Returned soldiers often have emotional scars that affect those they live with, in many cases to the extent that family members of veterans require therapy themselves.

Tricare Prime

Who can enroll?

Active military personnel and family members

Retired military veterans and dependents (until eligibility for Medicare is reached)

Those who have received the Medal of Honor and families

Activated members of the National Guard, and in some cases Reserve and Retired personnel.

Former spouses who fill specific qualifications.

Any member of Prime on active duty as well as their families have zero out-of pocket costs. All others are subject to nominal enrollment fees and co-pays.

Tricare Select

Select is accessible in the U.S. and is a fee-for-service program. All above-mentioned members are eligible, excluding those on active duty. Out-of-pockets costs will include annual deductibles and some cost sharing. This varies according to each client’s military status.

Select can be a great option for those who have supplemental insurance to Tricare, like Medicare or commercial insurance from their workplace, or people who are happy with their current healthcare situation and don’t want to change to an in-network Tricare provider.

In order to confirm your eligibility and registration, connect with a preferred Tricare addiction treatment center. Because Avenues Recovery is one of the Tricare-approved rehab facilities, we are authorized to provide Tricare benefits and can get you properly set up right away. Our staff will navigate the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) [4], get you registered, and connect with your Primary Care Physician (PCPM) to arrange necessary referrals. All you have to do is give us a call, and we will take care of the rest!

Variations of these two main plans include:

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

TRICARE Select Overseas

TRICARE For Life

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

TRICARE Young Adult

Tricare Substance Abuse Coverage

People receiving addiction treatment services from an approved provider such as Avenues Recovery can often receive Tricare substance abuse coverage. Medications and care for detox and residential treatment are all part of Tricare benefits. Furthermore, once a member is enrolled in Tricare-approved drug rehab programs like inpatient rehab and Partial Hospitalization Programs, drug and alcohol detox services may be included as well.

Does Tricare Cover Inpatient Rehab?

Yes! As long as you have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD), are dealing with withdrawal symptoms requiring medical attention, and are having difficulties coping with daily routines, residential treatment is absolutely necessary and covered by your Tricare plans. This falls under emergency treatment.

In the event of non-emergency addiction treatment, such as when a person feels the need for treatment on his own, he must be authorized by Tricare or its managing partner. Avenues can help facilitate those authorizations upon contact from the client seeking addiction treatment.

Does Tricare Cover Outpatient Programs?

When qualifying, Tricare will give coverage for many types of outpatient treatments . Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) and PHP are often eligible. There are many individuals who while not needing round the clock medical care and supervision, greatly benefit from treatment groups and counseling sessions offered by Tricare preferred providers. The flexibility of such treatment gives clients the chance to resume their daily routines, family responsibility and jobs while remaining under the care of addiction treatment facilities. In some cases, Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is necessary and covered as well.

Can Veterans Affairs Beneficiaries Access Tricare?

The Department of Veterans Affairs is a cabinet-level agency tasked with providing benefits and and support for military veterans in their time after service. The VA provides health care through its medical facilities and clinics across the country. Since 1995, every Veterans Affairs’ health care facility has been part of the Tricare network [5]. This means that they are able to service all Tricare members, including Active Duty personnel, retirees and their families on a space available basis. This is true for both primary and specialty care.

There’s no premiums for active duty dependents and the deductible is Pennies compared to most of my friends civilian deductibles. Tricare covers most medically necessary things as long as there’s proper documentation.

You can enroll her in Tricare Select and she can go to any in network provider without a referral (some things still need prior authorization though). Active duty SMs/families have an annual $1,000 catastrophic cap, so you’ll never pay more than that for healthcare in a calendar year. My wife dropped her workplace coverage when we got married and did not regret it.

The Defense Health Agency announced on Jan. 23 that people who use TRICARE in Kansas can get emergency prescription refills due to the impending arrival of severe winter weather. This offer expires on Feb. 2 and is offered throughout the State of Kansas.

TRICARE beneficiaries who want to receive an emergency refill of prescription medications in Kansas are instructed to take their prescription bottles to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Beneficiaries who don’t have a bottle to bring in, or if the label is damaged or missing, should get in touch with Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for help. You can find a network pharmacy by calling Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303 or by clicking here.

The DHA encourages people to visit the pharmacy where they had their prescriptions filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain can be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, people can talk to them about calling in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

TRICARE beneficiaries who are not active duty military can get urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral, according to the DHA. This allows beneficiaries to get non-emergency help for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is not available due to emergencies.

You should know there are some steps to take to ensure your TRICARE coverage continues as you make the transition to civilian life. This article explains what you need to do to keep your TRICARE benefit in retirement.

“Your TRICARE coverage doesn’t automatically continue when you retire,” said Zelly Zim, senior program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Division at the Defense Health Agency. “You must take action to keep your TRICARE coverage for yourself and any eligible family members.”

Why you need to act now

When you retire from active duty or the National Guard or Reserve, you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. A QLE gives you 90 days to enroll in a TRICARE health plan. You’ll still have access to TRICARE coverage. Unlike during your military service, in retirement you need to choose your plan.

Before you retire

Schedule your Separation History and Physical Examination between 90 and 180 days before you retire or start terminal leave. The Department of Veterans Affairs uses the SHPE as a single separation examination to capture your complete medical history.

Update DEERS

Your first priority is updating your status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. You have three ways to do this:

Log in to milConnect.

Call 800-538-9552.

Visit a Uniformed Services ID card office near you.

Get new ID cards

Once your retirement paperwork processes, you’ll need to get new Uniformed Services ID cards for yourself and your family members. Find an ID card office at the RAPIDS ID Card Office Online.

Choose your health plan

Review your TRICARE options based on your situation. You’ll need to enroll yourself and eligible family members within 90 days of retirement to avoid a gap in coverage and claims processing. Eligible family members don’t have to be in the same plan, as described in the TRICARE Retiring From Active Duty Brochure.

If retiring from active duty before age 65, your health plan options are:

TRICARE Prime (if you live in a Prime Service Area)

TRICARE Select

US Family Health Plan (available in six U.S. locations)

TRICARE Prime Demo (available in Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida areas)

TRICARE For Life if you have Medicare Part A and Part B, regardless of age

If retiring from the National Guard or Reserve, your health plan options are:

Before age 60: TRICARE Retired Reserve

Ages 60-64: Same options as retirees from active duty

Age 60 and older: TRICARE For Life (once you have Medicare Part A and have Medicare Part B).

Enroll in your new plan

You must enroll within 90 days of your retirement date to avoid a gap in coverage. You can enroll:

Online through milConnect

By phone with your TRICARE regional contractor

By mail using an enrollment form

If you’re overseas: In person at a TRICARE Area Office

If you have Medicare Part A and Part B, you automatically have TRICARE for Life if you meet all other requirements for TRICARE coverage

Set up payment

Most retiree plans require enrollment fees or premiums. For TRICARE Select or TRICARE Prime, you’ll pay enrollment fees. You must set up payments to keep your coverage active.

Consider setting up an allotment from your retirement pay to cover your TRICARE enrollment fees automatically. This convenient payment option deducts the fees directly from your retirement check, saving you time. There are no enrollment forms or fees for TRICARE for Life.

Consider dental and vision coverage

When you retire, your active duty dental and vision coverage will end. You can choose to enroll in:

Dental coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage through FEDVIP if you enroll in a TRICARE health plan

Your pharmacy coverage

You’ll have access to:

Military pharmacies

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

Retail network pharmacies

Non-network pharmacies

You may need to fill maintenance medications through home delivery. Contact Express Scripts to learn about prescription requirements and copayments.

Going overseas?

If you plan to live overseas after retirement, your TRICARE options will differ. Before you move, contact International SOS, the TRICARE overseas contractor, to learn about available plans and coverage in your new location.

Plan ahead for Medicare

If you’ll turn 65 after retirement, sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65, as described in the TRICARE and Medicare Turning 65 Brochure.

If you receive Social Security Disability Insurance monthly benefits, you'll become eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B in the 25th month of receiving SSDI. You must keep Medicare Part A and Part B to remain eligible for TRICARE.

What if you miss the 90-day window?

If you miss the 90-day enrollment window and you’re not yet age 65, you can request retroactive enrollment up to 12 months from your retirement date. Remember:

Claims can’t process until enrollment completes.

Coverage starts from your retirement date.

You must pay applicable enrollment fees back to your retirement date.

Until you enroll in a plan, you can only get care at military hospitals and clinics. This is only true during your time between the 90-day enrollment window and when you sign up for a plan.

Changes to your coverage

You no longer have access to certain TRICARE services after you retire. These include but aren’t limited to the following:

The Extended Care Health Option for family members with special needs

Hearing aids and hearing aid services, although you may be able to get hearing aids through the VA or the Retiree-At-Cost Hearing Aid Program

Chiropractic care through military hospitals or clinics

Routine eye exams except with TRICARE Prime or enrollment in FEDVIP

The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.
At the core of the new platform are the patient advocates who help patients navigate the MHS.
Capturing the patient experience PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments.
The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels.","The Defense Health Agency implemented a new system for patient advocates to track and manage patient feedback across the Military Health System.

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr. Gabrielle Crane, chief of the patient experience branch at DHA.

The primary goal of PAART is to use patient feedback provided to drive improvements within military hospitals and clinics, Crane said. The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.

""It's standardized and consistent,"" she explained. ""The old process was fragmented within each MTF, and patient advocates had differing processes for how they managed feedback. The new system is exciting because now it will be streamlined and provide transparency enterprise-wide.""

For military hospital and clinic leadership, PAART will provide data across the MHS and make better decisions to ensure data-driven improvements — ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience and safety.

At the core of the new platform are the patient advocates who help patients navigate the MHS.

“An advocate is the shipmate, the battle buddy, and the wingman,"" said Crane. “PAART enables an advocate to document interactions and ensure warm handoffs and transfers to the appropriate person who can provide service recovery.""

Capturing the patient experience

PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments. Advocates can select preestablished fields including case date, type, location, and patient category.

The system categorizes cases by severity, which dictates the timeline for resolution:

Emergent cases, posing an immediate threat to life or safety, are flagged for immediate action.

Urgent cases, with a significant impact on health, have a 24-hour response time.

Routine casesare to be completed within 10 business days.

Crane noted PAART’s technology will flag cases to ensure meeting those windows, giving leaders ""at each level an awareness of those timelines and where we are in meeting them.""

The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels. Using the PAART system is mandatory for patient advocates — and a vital measure of effectiveness. PAART data can be used to analyze patient feedback and identify common trends, which ultimately assist in developing solutions as well as inform training programs for military hospital and clinic staff. The portal enables advocates to inform supervisors or military hospital and clinic leadership of concerns expressed by patients in their local area.

""It will allow us to see how we're doing across the entire system,"" Crane said. ""We will be able to identify which areas we can work on or which areas we can leverage and are doing well. We can learn best practices and incorporate those best practices across our system.""

Improving patient experience through PAART

Crane said the new system ""allows transparency at all levels: at the MTF level, at the network level, and at headquarters.”

Through centralizing feedback, the DHA aims to foster a ""culture of continuous improvement,"" Crane said. She noted the system strengthens trust by showing patients that the DHA created it with them in mind: When feedback goes into a system where it can be tracked, trended, and escalated, it counters the feeling that a complaint ""goes nowhere.""

""This was designed with the patient at the center of everything we're doing,"" she added, “we want to make sure that our patients’ voices are being heard and that they're being provided with the appropriate service recovery. That is what’s necessary to ensure the patient journey and experience is where it needs to be.”

Safeguards are in place to protect patient confidentiality. All users of PAART must complete Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training, and patients can choose not to provide certain demographic information if they feel uncomfortable.

Looking ahead, Crane envisions technology will always evolve and that ""we are here to ensure that our patient advocates at the MTFs have the tools, resources, and training that they need to successfully complete their job and be the advocate our beneficiaries deserve.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9463019/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-23 16:56:38.944233

Consider setting up an allotment from your retirement pay to cover your TRICARE enrollment fees automatically. This convenient payment option deducts the fees directly from your retirement check, saving you time. There are no enrollment forms or fees for TRICARE for Life.

Consider dental and vision coverage When you retire, your active duty dental and vision coverage will end. You can choose to enroll in:

Dental coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage through FEDVIP if you enroll in a TRICARE health plan

Your pharmacy coverage You’ll have access to:

Military pharmacies

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

Retail network pharmacies

Non-network pharmacies

You may need to fill maintenance medications through home delivery. Contact https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/contact-us to learn about prescription requirements and copayments.

Going overseas? If you plan to live overseas after retirement, your TRICARE options will differ. Before you move, contact https://www.tricare-overseas.com/, the TRICARE overseas contractor, to learn about available plans and coverage in your new location.

Plan ahead for Medicare If you’ll turn 65 after retirement, sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65, as described in the TRICARE and Medicare Turning 65 Brochure. If you receive Social Security Disability Insurance monthly benefits, you will become entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B in the 25th month of receiving SSDI. You must keep Medicare Part A and Part B to remain eligible for TRICARE.

What if you miss the 90-day window? If you miss the 90-day enrollment window and you’re not yet age 65, you can request retroactive enrollment up to 12 months from your retirement date. Remember:

Claims can’t process until enrollment completes.

Coverage starts from your retirement date.

You must pay applicable enrollment fees back to your retirement date.

Until you enroll in a plan, you can only get care at military hospitals and clinics. This is only true during your time between the 90-day enrollment window and when you sign up for a plan.

Changes to your coverage You no longer have access to certain TRICARE services after you retire. These include but aren’t limited to the following:

The Extended Care Health Option for family members with special needs

Hearing aids and hearing aid services, although you may be able to get hearing aids through the VA or the Retiree-At-Cost Hearing Aid Program

Chiropractic care through military hospitals or clinics

Routine eye exams except with TRICARE Prime or enrollment in FEDVIP

The Leapfrog Group recognized Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point on Monday, December 15, 2025 as a recipient of a Top Ambulatory Surgery Center Award, marking the first time a military clinic earned the honor.

“This award recognizes the exceptional skill and knowledge of the staff aboard the clinic and our commitment to providing high-quality, safe patient care. Both are critical to our mission of ‘Keeping the Warfighter in the Fight,” said Navy Captain James Driscoll, the clinic’s commanding officer. “The core of that mission: the medical readiness of forces assigned to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and the wellness of communities surrounding the base, is at the forefront of everything we do here.”

The recognition, according to a press announcement by the Leapfrog Group published on December 15, 2025, “honors top hospitals and ASCs that demonstrate the highest performance in the nation on quality and patient safety, including ethical billing and informed patient consent procedures, lower infection rates, prevention of medication errors and surgical safety.”

“Having 13 of our military treatment facilities recognized is a remarkable achievement,” said Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, DHA’s acting assistant director for Health Care Administration in an article published December 18, 2025. “These facilities exemplify the Defense Health Agency’s steadfast commitment to high-quality care and is a testament to the exceptional care delivered to our patients.”

Mrs. Chelsea Mull, the clinic’s Infection Preventionist, and Navy Commander Carlton Bennett III, Director of the clinic’s Public Health Services, championed the effort to earn the award. “Achieving the Leapfrog Top ASC designation demonstrates that we consistently exceed national standards in these critical areas,” said Mull. “This achievement is a direct reflection of our staff’s dedication, hard work, and commitment to providing the highest level of care to our patients.”

The clinic serves as the keystone of medical readiness for units stationed aboard Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point such as the 2nd Marine Air Wing and Fleet Readiness Center East, and in the health and wellness of communities surrounding the base. In March 2025, a Veterans Affairs clinic opened within the facility and now provides outpatient care to eligible veterans.

When We March for Life, We Must Fight for the Hyde Amendment

By: James Lankford

This Jan. 23, as we mark the 53rd annual March for Life, we also recognize the 50th anniversary of the Hyde Amendment, which settled in law that American taxpayers do not subsidize elective abortions. Period. The Hyde Amendment is not about if elective abortion should be legal, it’s about who has to pay for it. For five decades, each Congress has voted in favor of the annual appropriation bills to affirm the Hyde Amendment. The citizens of our great nation have strongly held and widely diverse opinions about abortion, but in poll after poll, Americans agree that they should not be forced to pay for someone else’s abortion.

The Hyde Amendment has two clear tenets: federal taxpayers do not pay for abortions or subsidize programs that pay for abortions. Every federal healthcare program has Hyde Amendment protections, including Medicaid, Tricare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and Indian Health Services and Medicare, except for one healthcare program: Obamacare.

The so-called “Affordable Care Act” is the only healthcare plan that circumvents Hyde protections with its notorious “Section 1303” accounting gimmick created when the bill passed 16 years ago.

Democrats will often say that Obamacare abides by Hyde because Section 1303 requires a “separate payment” of at least a dollar each month for abortion coverage, which they know is an accounting sleight of hand. As soon as the law passed 16 years ago, the Obama administration ruled that “separate” actually meant “together” which allowed one payment to be split into two parts, often paid for by federal tax dollars.

The millions of people paying zero premiums for Obamacare do not pay an additional dollar for their abortion coverage; it’s included in their taxpayer-subsidized premium tax credit.

There are now 12 states that will not even allow a healthcare plan to be sold in the state unless it covers surgical and chemical abortion. In those states, every taxpayer is forced to subsidize abortions with their tax dollars and with their monthly premium dollars. Roughly 15 different insurers failed to even itemize dollars associated with abortion coverage on their enrollees’ bills, nor did they separately bill for the abortion premium amount, which is required by law.

Of course, the biggest evidence that Obamacare does not really have Hyde Amendment protections actually comes from the pro-abortion groups Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Freedom for All. They recently sent a strong letter to all Democratic members of Congress letting them know that they would fight against any member of Congress who adds Hyde protections to the Obamacare tax credits. They know that Obamacare is the only federal healthcare that pays for abortions, and they do not want to lose that revenue stream.

There is no debate that the cost of healthcare has skyrocketed. Former President Barack Obama’s pledge of a $2,500 savings for all American families in healthcare premiums has never materialized. For years, Republicans have laid out simple strategies to reduce the cost of healthcare, like allowing small businesses to join together into groups, creating subsidized high-risk pools to lower the cost for all health insurance and confronting the pharmacy benefit managers that limit formulary choices and drive up costs for the consumer.

But, each time we attempt to address healthcare costs, Democrats demand that any deal must include elective abortion coverage, paid for by American taxpayers. That is a non-starter for the millions of Americans that want healthcare to save lives, not take it. We don’t believe that some children are disposable and some children are valuable. We believe all children are valuable.

Which is why the conversation about the 50-year-old Hyde Amendment matters, because children matter. All of them. We can reduce the cost of healthcare, but to do it, Democrats are going to have to be more flexible on Hyde.

No Room for Delay

You don’t have time for waitlists or red tape. When you need care, you need it now—before that nagging issue becomes a sidelining injury.

That’s why we work hard to ensure:

Referrals and authorizations don’t stand in your way of getting started with us

Appointments are typically available within 24–48 hours

You can access us easily at both South Tampa and Westchase

Whether you’re between deployments or navigating transition to civilian life, we make it easy to get in, get evaluated, and get a plan that respects your time.

Beyond Rehab: Precision Care Built Around You

We don’t just treat the injury, we treat the person behind it. Your background, your career, your physical history—these are the building blocks of how we customize your care.

Maybe it’s your shoulder that’s never been the same since a training injury. Maybe it’s your knees after airborne school. Or maybe it’s your back after a decade wearing gear. Whatever it is, we’re not guessing.

We listen first. Then we evaluate thoroughly. We explain everything in clear terms and make sure you understand what’s happening—and what comes next.

Technology That Works as Hard as You Do

Our therapists don’t just rely on manual techniques and exercise. We’re equipped with clinical technology that accelerates outcomes and elevates your care experience:

Neubie electrical stimulation to rebuild neuromuscular control and reduce pain

PEMF therapy to reduce inflammation deep at the cellular level

TECAR therapy to accelerate healing and restore tissue function

HRV diagnostics to measure your readiness and recovery potential

We use these tools strategically—not because they’re flashy, but because they work. When you’re balancing physical demand with limited time, precision matters.

Not Just for the Injured

You don’t have to be broken to benefit from physical therapy. Some of the most successful outcomes we see come from patients who show up before things fall apart.

We work with service members prepping for training cycles, veterans easing back into fitness, and military parents who simply want to stay strong for the demands of everyday life.

Whether it’s refining how you move, keeping old injuries from resurfacing, or helping your body recover better between workouts, we help you stay ahead of setbacks.

This includes veterans returning to the gym, parents carrying the weight of family life, and service members preparing for their next move, physically or professionally.

We also work with military spouses and dependents, ensuring that the entire family unit has the tools and care needed to stay healthy, strong, and pain-free.

Your Mission, Our Priority

You’ve taken care of others your whole career. Now it’s your turn.

We bring the same commitment to excellence that defines military service into every session. Our clinic is calm, efficient, and driven by purpose, just like the patients we serve.

Here, you’ll find:

Experienced clinicians who respect your experience

A clear plan that fits your goals and schedule
