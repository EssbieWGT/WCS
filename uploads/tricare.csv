So retired over the summer and this past weekend had my first real health problem requiring me to use the system. I have both tricare prime retiree and VA healthcare.

Anyways Saturday rolled around and I felt like ass, coughing, fever, etc. Figured probably Covid, so hid away in my room and tried to sweat it out a few days.

Yesterday (Labor Day) it was unbearable and getting worse so I contacted the VA who referred me to an urgent care clinic. I went in and they told me possibly bronchitis or pneumonia, prescribed me some steroids and an inhaler and sent me on my way.

This morning it was even worse so I called the tricare nurse advice line. They tried getting me in to my PCM, but were unable so they recommended I go to the ER. I live next to a base, so my PCM is at an MTF. So it is my understanding that between these two visits I shouldn’t hypothetically be charged for anything correct?

It may include funny memes, entertainment and news stories, and pictures and updates from friends and family. With so much to scroll through, it can be difficult to spot a concerning post made by a fellow warrior, friend, or family member when they may be thinking about suicide.

Learn how to recognize the warning signs of suicide on social media and what you can do to help. Recognizing the signs and taking the right steps can save lives.

What to look for

Signs of emotional crisis or thoughts of suicide are not always obvious on social media. A fellow warrior, friend, or loved one may share that they are going through a challenging time and may mention feeling hopeless or ending their lives. They might frame these statements as a joke or even include a meme or a lighthearted emoji. Regardless of how casual they seem, these posts can be signs of more serious psychological health concerns.

If someone you know makes comments about suicide or expresses emotional pain online, always take them seriously. Whether it's a single post or multiple, do not ignore them. In addition to posts that directly reference dying, signs of emotional crisis in social media posts may include those that mention:

Self-medicating in response to emotional or physical pain

Feeling alone or isolated

Feeling guilt, shame, anger, or rage (seeking revenge)

Feeling like a burden to coworkers or loved ones

Feeling trapped or in unbearable pain

Expressing hopelessness or having no reason to live

Saying goodbye or expressing a desire to escape

Describing methods of suicide

Some of the above signs may be expressed through images as well. If you spot a post that contains one or more of the above signs, it could indicate that the person is in crisis. Do not wait for someone else to respond. Reaching out and taking the right action may save their life.

What to do

A common misconception is that by asking someone about suicide, you are putting the idea into their head. However, reaching out is one of the most helpful things you can do. If you notice someone engaging with social media in a concerning way, immediately reach out to them through private message or chat, or by calling or meeting with them in person. Starting the conversation can be as simple as saying, ""It seems like you're going through a hard time right now. Can we talk?""

Follow these three simple steps when reaching out:

Ask:

Are they considering suicide?

Listen:

Check in with them and see how they are feeling. Listen to their concerns and remind them that they are not alone.

Get Help:

Speak with a trained crisis responder through the Veterans/Military Crisis Line: dial 988 and press 1 or text 838255.

They can provide guidance to you and/or the person in crisis and help connect you with services.

If they are in immediate danger of suicide, call 911.

Are you calling the Military/Veterans Crisis Line from overseas? The country code to reach the United States will be required for each of these numbers, depending on your location.

Europe, call: 844-702-5495 or DSN 988

Pacific, call: 844-702-5493 or DSN 988

Southwest Asia, call: 855-422-7719 or DSN 988

Contact the Safety Team:

Along with reaching out directly and providing crisis resources, you should also alert the social media platform's safety team. While each platform's protocol is different, generally they will assess the post and reach out to the user with resources to connect them with help. To learn more about the safety teams and protocols visit Facebook, X, Instagram, and Snapchat.

For many Americans, turning 65 is a milestone not just in life but in healthcare. While some people can delay Medicare without penalty, others are required to enroll immediately to avoid costly mistakes. Knowing which group you fall into can mean the difference between smooth coverage and a lifetime of penalties.

The Five Groups Required to Enroll at 65

No Employer or Group Coverage

If you’re not working and don’t have insurance through your own job or your spouse’s employer plan, Medicare enrollment at 65 is mandatory. Failing to sign up leaves you uninsured and subject to penalties.

Employees of Small Companies (19 or Fewer Employees)

For workers at small businesses, Medicare becomes the primary payer at age 65, and the employer’s plan shifts to secondary coverage. If you don’t enroll in Medicare, you could be responsible for most of your medical bills.

ACA, Marketplace, or Obamacare Plans

Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans stop making financial sense once you turn 65. Premium credits and tax subsidies vanish, and you’re required to transition to Medicare. Staying on ACA could cost you far more than switching.

Retired Military with Tricare or Tricare for Life

Tricare requires enrollment in Medicare Part B at age 65. Without it, you risk losing Tricare coverage and may face permanent late enrollment penalties. Active-duty military are the only exception until their service ends.

COBRA Participants

If you’re on COBRA when you turn 65, you still need to enroll in Medicare. COBRA drops to secondary coverage, paying only 20% of claims—leaving you responsible for the other 80% if you don’t sign up for Medicare.

Enrollment Timeline and Process

Your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) begins three months before your 65th birthday, includes your birth month, and extends three months after. Enrolling early ensures coverage starts the first day of your birth month. Waiting until or after your birthday can delay coverage by up to three months.

Already on Social Security? You’ll be enrolled automatically, with your Medicare card arriving about 100 days before your birthday.

Not on Social Security? You must enroll yourself either at ssa.gov, by submitting paper forms, or with help from a Medicare educator.

Penalties for Missing the Deadline

The stakes are high if you miss your Medicare Part B enrollment:

10% penalty added to your premium for every 12 months of delay.

Penalties last for life.

For Tricare members, skipping enrollment risks losing Tricare altogether.

COBRA participants without Medicare at 65 could face massive out-of-pocket costs, as COBRA won’t cover what Medicare should.

How Medicare Coordinates with Other Coverage

When you turn 65:

Small employer plans, Tricare, and COBRA all move to secondary status, meaning Medicare pays first.

Tricare + Medicare together provide excellent, comprehensive coverage, including drug benefits.

COBRA can still cover younger spouses or dependents, but the primary enrollee must transition to Medicare.

Getting Help with Enrollment

Navigating Medicare’s rules can feel overwhelming, but you don’t have to do it alone. Experts like Erica Smiley at MedicareSchool.com help seniors:

Understand whether they need to enroll at 65

Compare plan options (Medigap, Advantage, Part D)

Avoid penalties and gaps in coverage

If you’re approaching 65, review your coverage early, check your Initial Enrollment Period dates, and get help if you’re unsure. A misstep could cost you for life.

According to a recent report from KNSI Radio, 40-year-old Adelle Starin – who operated a store that sold baby products and toys – made false claims for reimbursement to the healthcare program TRICARE to the tune of $9 million.

Authorities say that TRICARE initially paid out the claims, but when it started rejecting them, she created a fictitious shell company – Sunshine Medical LLC – in which she falsely claimed she represented two lenders who needed financing to purchase supplies from her firm.

However, according to a previous press release from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), her firm “had no business operations or revenue.” Therefore, to pull off the scheme, she had to create fake invoices for Sunshine Medical LLC and send them to the lenders she claimed the firm represented.

All in all, she fraudulently raked in $9 million from her fabrications to TRICARE.

She pleaded guilty to wire fraud in December 2024 and was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $2.35 million in restitution in addition to her time behind bars.

In an email sent August 26 to The Dallas Express, DHA acknowledged receiving a request for records.
“We regret the substantial delay in processing requests,” DHA’s FOIA analyst wrote in the interim response.
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed in 1967, states that “all federal agencies are required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business days, unless there are ‘unusual circumstances,'” per the Department of Justice website.
The agency’s handling of FOIA requests echoes similar struggles across the federal government.","The Defense Health Agency says it is so backlogged with Freedom of Information Act requests that it cannot meet the law’s 20-day deadline.

In an email sent August 26 to The Dallas Express, DHA acknowledged receiving a request for records. However, the FOIA agent said the request was number 950 out of 951 open cases and estimated a completion date of October 8, 2025 — roughly three weeks after the statutory deadline.

“We regret the substantial delay in processing requests,” DHA’s FOIA analyst wrote in the interim response.

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed in 1967, states that “all federal agencies are required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business days, unless there are ‘unusual circumstances,'” per the Department of Justice website. The unusual circumstances include situations where it will take an exceptional amount of time to collect records from field offices, requests for large amounts of documents, or those that require consultation with another agency.

Delays are now common, and transparency advocates warn that mounting backlogs weaken the law’s role as a tool for public oversight of federal agencies.

Federal News Network has reported that FOIA offices across the government are chronically underfunded and understaffed, despite receiving a record 900,000 requests in fiscal 2022.

“FOIA offices have traditionally been understaffed and underbudgeted,” Marshall Hamilton, an executive at Tyler Technologies, told the outlet. He added that shortages are “a big reason why these [FOIA] backlogs are increasing governmentwide.”

The Defense Health Agency manages health care delivery for 9.5 million beneficiaries worldwide through TRICARE and serves as a medical combat support agency to the Army, Navy, and Air Force, according to the agency website. Its FOIA office is based in Falls Church, Virginia, and processes requests for multiple subcomponents, including Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System.

The agency’s handling of FOIA requests echoes similar struggles across the federal government.

On July 8, the Federal Communications Commission agreed to expedite the processing of an earlier records request from The Dallas Express due to a “compelling need” to inform the public about government affairs. Seven weeks later, the special government process intended to produce records quickly has still not produced any documents.

The Dallas Express recently reported that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to cite COVID-19 as a reason for reduced FOIA capacity, despite the pandemic emergency ending more than two years ago. In another case, the Air Force blew past multiple deadlines for records regarding water contamination at Dyess Air Force Base before ultimately stating that no responsive documents existed.

Hamilton said agencies are increasingly turning to automation and artificial intelligence to manage FOIA case loads, describing the tools as “force multipliers” that can speed reviews and balance workloads among analysts. But without more staff and resources, watchdogs argue, the law’s guarantees of timely public access remain out of reach.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Waiting-concept.-Human-skeleton-sitting-at-wooden-table-with-laptop-indoors-Image-by-New-AfricaShutterstock.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-31 11:56:13.928035

Tricare just approved Wegovy for me though so I’m begrudgingly switching to see if I get same results and not have to pay out of pocket.
So I downloaded the PA form so I could see what is up.
The form says for Zepbound or Wegovy but if you go thru the questions it seems there is no answer that gets you approved for Zepbound.
If the PA form has both meds listed how is it not in the formulary?",No. I have been paying out of pocket for compounded.

If the PA form has both meds listed how is it not in the formulary? Anyways….health insurance companies really tick me off.
