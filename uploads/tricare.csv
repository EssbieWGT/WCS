Hubby works as a mechanic technician for the army. Unfortunately, his salary disqualifies him from Tricare so he is on a healthcare plan with SelectHealth through his job. It seems to take a decent amount out of his check and benefits are so/so.

I'm currently on my parents insurance but I turn 26 in a few months so I'll be kicked off at that point. I will also be finishing a limited term internship the same month as my birthday so I will (hopefully) be transitioning to a new job around that same time that will be full time and likely offer benefits.

As a military spouse should I just get on Tricare and not sign up for any healthcare plans through my employer? Are Tricare benefits and cost typically better than what I could be offered through other major healthcare insurance providers?

I also have to consider that hubby and I want to have kids within a couple years and I've heard that Tricare is really good for families including covering all delivery costs at the hospital etc. Also, I might have some employment gaps so I can stay at home once I start having kids.

There is also, of course, the option of getting added onto my husband's healthcare plan with SelectHealth. Not sure if that will somehow be cheaper or easier than me being on Tricare separate from him but obviously I want the best coverage I can get.

What would y'all recommend I do at this point?",,N,0.0,2026-01-04 00:12:03.928486

The births of these little ones mark a special moment for both sets of proud parents and the dedicated staff at TAMC. Col. William Bimson, commander of TAMC, along with department leadership, visited the parents to present baby gift baskets for the new arrivals, celebrating their milestones and offering support as they begin their journey of parenthood.

The first baby of the year, a boy, was born at 5:16 a.m. on Jan. 1 to U.S. Army Capt. Henry Zenger, a current graduate student at of the University of Hawaii, and U.S. Army Capt. Cecelia Zenger, a social work intern at TAMC. The couple arrived in Oahu in October 2024 and is thrilled to welcome their second child to the family.

The second baby, a girl, was born at 5:49 a.m. on Jan. 1 to Pfc. LaShawn Brabham, an infantry soldier with the 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, and his wife, Kayla Brabham. The couple arrived in Oahu in May 2025 and is excited to add their second child to the family.

Reflecting on their experiences at TAMC, both couples shared their positive thoughts about the physicians, nurses, and staff in the Mother Baby Unit:

“The support from the staff made all the difference, and we couldn’t be more grateful,” Henry Zenger said. “New year, new baby, let’s go!”

""I had a fast birth. It was four minutes, and I couldn’t have done it without my amazing nurse, Leilani Jimenez,” Kayla Brabham said.

“It’s always a privilege to be part of such a special moment for families,” Dr. Jonathon Yu, a family medicine physician at TAMC, said. “Seeing the joy on the parents' faces when they meet their babies for the first time is what makes our work so rewarding.”

“Every birth story is unique, and being able to support families through this journey is an honor,” Taylor Dusa, an attending registered nurse, said.” We’re thrilled to welcome two beautiful lives into the world.”

TAMC is a vital center for maternal care, delivering approximately 1,289 babies each year. The facility serves military families stationed in Hawaii and supports the entire Indo-Pacific region, including active-duty personnel, their dependents, and eligible beneficiaries from various branches of the military.

TAMC's Labor and Delivery Unit is equipped with state-of-the-art technology, ensuring comprehensive prenatal care, labor support, and postnatal care for mothers and babies. The services offered at TAMC include:

Comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care

Take these steps to avoid some common trouble spots, and check out this TRICARE.mil article for even more details:

Address Changes

You’ll want to ensure the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) has your new residence on file. Update your contact information via the ID Card Office Online or call DEERS at (800) 538-9552. Note: You cannot use a post office box as your DEERS address.

You’ll also need to update your address with Express Scripts to use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. You can update your information online or by calling Express Scripts at (877) 363-1303.

Finally, update your address with the Social Security Administration, which handles Medicare processing.

Plan Changes

You will retain your Medicare and TRICARE For Life benefits in your new location, but keep these potential changes in mind:

If you’ve signed up for a Medicare Advantage Plan (MAP, or Medicare Part C) and you move out of that plan’s coverage area, you can enroll in a new MAP or revert to Original Medicare coverage during a special enrollment period.

Moving overseas? TRICARE For Life becomes your primary payer for TRICARE-covered services unless you have other health insurance. Note: You must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums to use TRICARE For Life. Contact International SOS to find a provider or learn more about overseas care options.

Family members using TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select who move with you will be eligible to change their coverage, as the move counts as a Qualifying Life Event.

It is so worth it to avoid nonsense like this article is describing.

Tricare as a whole isn't the best that's for sure. But I sure went prime when I was pregnant and I guess I was lucky everyone was covered(I was high risk both times).

Now, as far as using normal Tricare as opposed to prime or select(whatever they call it these days), I will say normal Tricare covered all of my gastric bypass and everything after it, including having to go back in for a bleed.

Now, my husband is on recruiting duty and in MN there are no active bases. So here when have prime remote? But we never have copays unless it's for like plastic surgery or contact fittings.

First off, I’m SO happy I found this forum. It’s helping me get answers and so I hope to contribute to answers and topics to help others. So here’s my newest speedbump, and maybe this will help others in the future if they find it!

I’m retired US military and through some inheritance, and careful saving through my time in the military, have had enough saved to apply for the Golden Visa (while my wife continues to work a full time job until she’s ready to leave). I have a retirement, some disability, and we look forward to spending our retirement time in Portugal.

As part of the AIMA appointment, they require an apostilled private health insurance showing that I am covered in Portugal (as I can’t be covered by the public system… fair). My Tricare coverage (tricare overseas) covers everything we need, for the duration of my lifetime. But in the US, as far as I can tell, you cannot apostille documents that are not issued by a government agency. I can apostille marriage certificates, FBI background checks, etc, because they are all signed by government agencies.

Tricare, is a private company, contracted by the government. THey also don’t have a pdf policy, you can only search online to get answers, so it’s hard to ‘prove’ that they cover the necessary things.

Any advice? I’d like to NOT purchase private insurance just to qualify for a VISA considering I have private insurance that DOES cover me… I’m just having a hard time getting apostilled proof.
