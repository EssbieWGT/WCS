So I'm retired which gives me access to Tricare. I also get Health Insurance through my job.

My spouse wants to give up Tricare and only use my job healthcare because Tricare has been crappy the last year for them (example, not once, not twice, but on 5 separate occasions Tricare has assigned my spouse a PCM or medical office that has not been operational for 2 or more years).

This year’s theme, “The Kaleidoscope of Radiologic Technology,” emphasized the multifaceted role of all Defense Health Agency military treatment facility Radiology Department staff who support operational readiness, medical diagnosis, and military healthcare.

The Radiology Department staff provide critical clinical support services in support of force health protection and operational readiness. Compiled statistics from last year help to tell their multi-faceted importance.

There was a total of [approximately] 17,260 diagnostic exams performed in 2024, consisting of more than 750 computed tomography exams, nearly 1,300 mammography exams, over 340 magnetic resonance imagery exams, 465 ultrasounds and approximately 13,515 X-rays.

The annual Rad Tech Week gave the team thew opportunity to showcase radiology history, recognize staff achievements, and host training events designed to strengthen readiness and cross-departmental collaboration.

Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Marlon Spruance Mercurio Fleming and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Juliana Raines, two of NMRTC Bremerton’s radiologic technologists dedicated to safeguarding readiness and delivering patient care reflected on their professional journeys and commitment to technical excellence and operational efficiency in their chosen field of expertise.

“Knowing the images I obtain directly impact diagnosis and treatment is what motivates me,” Fleming said. “We’re a key part of operational readiness, helping service members recover and return to the mission.”

Raines added, “Radiology is always evolving. Every day presents new challenges, whether it’s supporting surgical teams or urgent care. Our adaptability is vital for readiness.”

Each day begins with equipment and safety checks to ensure mission readiness. Fleming and Raines review schedules for special cases such as operating room support, portable exams, and trauma imaging for urgent care. Their routine combines technical skill, patient reassurance, and vigilant attention to radiation safety, supporting the wider operational health mission.

“The most rewarding moments come when you see the impact on patients and their families,” Raines said. “That’s when you know you’re contributing to readiness and recovery.”

Both attest that balancing efficiency and compassion is critical, especially in trauma scenarios where rapid imaging must be paired with patient-centered care.

“A common misconception is that we’re just button pushers,” Fleming explained. “In reality, we need deep anatomical knowledge, critical thinking, and a readiness mindset to support each department and patient.”

Core qualities for success include attention to detail, adaptability, and calmness under pressure.

“Clear communication and teamwork keep the hospital running smoothly, especially during staffing shortages or high operational tempo,” Fleming said. “Imaging supports almost every department, so our readiness directly affects the care we provide.”

Technologists at NMRTC Bremerton stay current by engaging in Navy online training modules, in-service sessions, and continuing education through Navy and national accredited organizations.

“Constant learning is non-negotiable,” Raines said. “Technology evolves rapidly, and staying updated ensures we’re always ready for any mission.”

In collaborating with nursing, surgery, urgent care, and outpatient clinics, Fleming, Raines and others coordinate closely, delivering the diagnostic support required for timely medical diagnosis and treatment.

When patients are anxious, in pain, or have special needs, technologists prioritize comfort and clear communication. Fleming and Raines take time to explain procedures, offer reassurance, and adapt imaging techniques to meet operational and patient care requirements.

For those considering a career as a Navy HM specializing in Rad Tech, Fleming advises, “Be ready to work hard and learn constantly. The technical and leadership skills you gain are unmatched. You’ll play an important role in maintaining operational readiness.”

Staffing shortages can stretch resources, especially during deployments and periods of high clinical demand. “We rely on teamwork and cross-training to meet operational goals,” Fleming said.

Raines added, “Flexibility and collaboration are key when the department is stretched thin.”

During National Rad Tech Week, NMRTC Bremerton’s radiology team honored the profession’s history and their ongoing commitment to operational readiness.

“Every image supports the mission,” Raines said. “It’s a privilege to serve and ensure our military community is prepared for whatever comes next.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9408026/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-24 18:56:19.145588

Tricare is a common health insurance in Utah, and individuals who have Tricare may wish to find sex therapists who are in-network with their health insurance.

When you see a sex therapist who is in-network with Tricare, each session you’ll pay only a copay, which typically ranges from $0-$75/session. Depending on your plan, you may first need to pay the provider’s full session fee until you meet your annual deductible, which is the total amount of medical expenses required before your health insurance starts to cover costs. Some plans cover the cost of in-network therapy sessions before the deductible is met; to verify whether your specific plan covers therapy sessions and at what rate, visit the Tricare website or call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask about your coverage for outpatient mental health.

Best decision of my 38 year career. 10 months of full pay and benefits along with 2 years of annual leave payout leading into 12/31 retirement. Package very common in private sector but we have never seen that kind of offer in government and probably never will again. Best wishes and best of luck.

Navigating career advancement in federal jobs can be a complex and often frustrating process, but it also offers unique benefits like job security and meaningful work. Here's a succinct guide based on the experiences and advice shared by redditors:

Navigating the Hiring Process

Steps to Getting a Federal Job: The federal hiring process can be lengthy and intricate. Here are the nine steps as outlined by a redditor:

Apply.

Get referred to the hiring manager.

Get interviewed.

Get a Tentative Offer Letter.

Accept Tentative Offer.

Start a BI (background investigation).

Get Final Offer.

Get start date (EOD).

Walk through the door and take the Oath of Office. ""There are about nine steps to getting the job... The first major hurdle is to get referred to the hiring manager.""

Importance of Being ""Best Qualified"": To increase your chances, you need to be in the ""Best Qualified"" group, which is where hiring managers select candidates for interviews. ""You need to be in the Best Qualified group. That's the group that the hiring manager will choose from for interviews.""

Veterans and Other Preferences: Veterans, military spouses, and individuals with certain disabilities (Schedule A) receive hiring preferences. ""Veterans Preference: Say a disabled Veteran comes in at 90 due to how the HR specialist ranks the disabled Veteran’s resume and questionnaire, if there is one. The disabled Veteran gets a 10-point preference."" ""Schedule A is NOT a preference. It’s just a non-competitive hiring option.""

Resume Tips: Keep your resume concise and tailored to the job posting. ""As someone in HR Recruitment and Placement in the federal government, I can absolutely assure you that 2 pages of a resume is more than enough, and 8 pages is absurd."" ""I simplified my resume down to one page per my boyfriends advice and plugged it into the template. That’s when I started getting more referrals and have had two interviews since doing so.""

Challenges: The process can be slow and competitive. ""The interview process is horrifyingly slow and in my experience offers/interviews are communicated after i have already accepted another role."" ""We are getting 1500 applications for 1 position jobs that we would previously have gotten less than 150 for.""

Career Advancement Opportunities

Specific Roles: Consider roles like Legislative Aide, Foreign Service Officer, or Presidential Management Fellow (PMF). ""If you're younger or have less experience, becoming a Legislative aide or a foreign service officer are great for your career."" ""There are examples of people who use an MPA to career change, and for them something like the presidential management fellowship or consulting is great.""

Internships and Pathway Programs: These can be a good entry point into federal service. ""State/Federal Government: Internships/Pathway Programs""

Data Analysis and Consulting: If you have strong quantitative skills, data analysis jobs are an option. Consulting for federal clients can also be lucrative. ""If you go to a Quant heavy school and you like numbers you can easily land data analysis jobs.""

Pros and Cons of Federal Employment

Pros:

Job Security and Benefits: Federal jobs often come with good benefits and pensions. ""Public sector pays less upfront, but you trade burnout and instability for long-term security, union protection, and a pension.""

Meaningful Work: Many find federal jobs rewarding due to their impact. [""It's meaningful, impactful work that they (hopefully) really enjoy and wouldn't be able to do without the degree.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicPolicy/comments/1d1anwn/comment/l",,N,0.0,2025-11-24 01:56:28.306084

About 6% of the War Department’s unresolved recommendations are classified as priority, while 12% of the VA’s are.","(The Center Square) – Of the 15 federal executive departments that compose the president’s Cabinet, the Departments of War and Veterans Affairs have the most unresolved, open recommendations for improvement from congressional watchdog, the Government Accountability Office.

The Department of War, which is overwhelmingly the largest executive branch department with about 3 million military and civilian personnel, has the most by far, with 778 open recommendations stretching back to 2011. Forty-eight of those were marked as priority. The Department of Veterans Affairs is the second-largest executive department, with more than 450,000 employees, and it has the second-highest, with 180 unresolved recommendations going back to 2012 and 22 flagged as priority.

The Government Accountability Office was established by Congress in 1921 as an independent, non-partisan congressional watchdog agency founded to “investigate all matters related to the use of public funds.” It provides reports to congressional committees and subcommittees on various government departments, agencies and projects to inform legislation and oversight.

Those reports typically include a list of recommendations for how the report’s subject can be improved. The recommendations are divided into priority action items and non-priority action items based on what is most pressing or important.

The War Department has some unresolved open priority recommendations from the office dating back to 2013 on topics like the poor living conditions in military barracks, improper TRICARE payments, fraud risk management and sustainment of the F-35 fighter jet program. Of all of the department’s open priority recommendations, it has partially addressed 15.

Many of the VA’s open priority recommendations are related to the department’s attempts to replace its legacy health records system. It rolled out a new electronic health records system starting with five medical centers in 2023 and was “making incremental improvements” to the new system as of March 2025, according to GAO, but there was still a lot to be done. There are approximately 170 VA Medical Centers.

The VA’s oldest unresolved priority recommendation concerns its “incomplete” sexual harassment policies and dates back to a 2020 report. The department has resolved all priority recommendations through 2019, according to GAO records, meaning the 22 that are open only date back to 2020. Of those, the VA has partially addressed five.

Some departments have open recommendations dating back to the early 2000s.

After the War Department and the VA, the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have the most unresolved GAO recommendations, at 163, 160, and 149, respectively. About 6% of the War Department’s unresolved recommendations are classified as priority, while 12% of the VA’s are.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/89/2897ef98-d9f5-40b7-b37c-9391b4017374/68dc22f86b013.image.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-23 04:56:42.346369

Upon assuming command of the ISR, COL Brown said, “The defining question for us is no longer just how we treat a casualty, but how to enable prolonged care in an austere environment under fire with limited resources. This is our challenge. This is our time.
