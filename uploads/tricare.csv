The stock ranked 496th in market activity, reflecting heightened investor interest. This momentum followed the company’s engagement at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), where it advanced discussions with U.S. government agencies on deploying Entolimod as a radiation countermeasure for military personnel. Key meetings included representatives from BARDA, AFRRI, and the MCDC, all aligned with the Department of Defense’s focus on CBRN defense solutions.

Tivic’s leadership emphasized the strategic value of these discussions, highlighting Entolimod’s potential to protect warfighters from radiation exposure. The product, currently in late-stage development with Fast Track designation, has drawn attention for its role in addressing unmet medical needs in military contexts. The MHSRS symposium provided direct access to funding bodies and decision-makers, reinforcing the company’s position in a niche but critical therapeutic area. Executives noted the importance of these collaborations in accelerating regulatory and commercial pathways for Entolimod.

Investor optimism appears tied to the perceived progress in military partnerships, despite Tivic’s broader financial challenges. The company’s dual-platform approach—combining biopharmaceuticals and bioelectronics—remains centered on Entolimod’s development, while its ncVNS device is in early-stage trials. However, the stock’s recent performance underscores market speculation around potential contracts, even as structural risks such as regulatory hurdles and funding dependencies persist.

The strategy of buying the top 500 stocks by daily trading volume and holding them for one day from 2022 to 2025 delivered moderate returns. Total profit reached $10,720, with cumulative returns at 1.08 times the initial investment.

Here’s what you need to know about finding different types of Medicare providers.
“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency.
Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.
Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety.","AUGUST 15, 2025 – If you have TRICARE For Life, you’ll get health care from Medicare providers. Here’s what you need to know about finding different types of Medicare providers.

“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency. “Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card at any medical appointment.”

How do I find the right provider?

TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. You can see three types of providers. This is described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

Medicare participating providers. They accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment. Seeing these providers will result in the lowest costs.

Medicare nonparticipating providers. They don’t accept the Medicare amount as full payment. They can charge up to 15% more than Medicare allows. TRICARE covers this extra cost.

Opt-out providers. They don’t work with Medicare at all. You’ll pay much more when you see these providers. Medicare won’t pay anything. TRICARE only pays what it normally would. This is about 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge. You pay the rest.

How do Medicare and TRICARE pay?

Medicare is generally your primary payer. Are you seeing a Medicare participating or Medicare nonparticipating provider? If so, then you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TFL. Most health care services fall into this category. Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.

Sometimes, TRICARE is your primary insurance. In this case, you must see TRICARE-authorized providers. This occurs when:

Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

You’re in overseas locations.

Can I get Department of Defense care?

You can get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

How does Department of Veterans Affairs care work?

VA providers can’t bill Medicare. If you see a VA provider for care that isn’t related to a service-connected condition, you’ll pay about 80% of the bill. TRICARE only pays up to 20%. Want to see a VA provider? Call the TFL contractor, WPS Military and Veterans Health, at 866-773-0404 to check your coverage before you go.

What about care overseas?

Do you live overseas? You can usually see any civilian provider. You’ll need to pay up front and file your own claim. In the Philippines, you must see certified providers.

For emergencies overseas, try military hospitals first. If none are available, go to the nearest emergency care facility. Call the TRICARE Overseas regional call center within 24 hours if you’re admitted.

How do I get emergency and urgent care?

When getting emergency or urgent care, always show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card.

Do you need emergency care? Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Do you need urgent care? Urgent care treats conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t life-threatening. Examples include sprains or rising fevers.

Are virtual health care visits covered?

You can get virtual health care via phone or video appointments. Medicare covers these visits when your provider accepts Medicare. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover the virtual health service.

Is mental health care covered?

Medicare covers visits with these mental health providers:

Psychiatrists and other doctors

Clinical psychologists

Clinical social workers

Clinical nurse specialists

Nurse practitioners

Physician assistants

What about services that need pre-authorization?

Some services need pre-authorization before you get care. These include:

Dental care for medical conditions

Home health care

Hospice care

Organ transplants

Some prescription drugs

Contact WPS if you have questions about pre-authorization requirements.

Remember! Seeing Medicare participating providers gives you the lowest out-of-pocket costs.

(Nasdaq: TIVC), a diversified therapeutics company, is proud to announce it advanced discussions with key US Government agencies through its participation in the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), held August 4-7, 2025, in Kissimmee, Florida. The MHSRS is the Department of Defense’s premier scientific meeting that brings together military, academic, and industry experts to discuss medical research and innovation in support of warfighter health and readiness.

Direct Access to DoD Decision-Makers and Researchers

MHSRS provides direct access to organizations seeking military partnerships and connects companies with key funding organizations. Tivic’s President of Biopharma and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Handley, met with key members of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) and the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC) to discuss potential pathways to deploy Entolimod as a military countermeasure.

BARDA’s mission is to develop medical countermeasures that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. AFRRI’s mission is to defend the Nation from nuclear and radiological threats through research, leadership, training, and education. The MCDC was formed in response to the US Government’s expressed interest to engage and fund advanced development efforts to support the Department of Defense’s (DoD) medical pharmaceutical and diagnostic requirements as related to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel.

“It was an honor to contribute to the vital conversations that were focused generally on radiation medical countermeasures, and specifically on our lead clinical product candidate, Entolimod, which has the potential to protect the warfighter in the instance that they are exposed to radiation,” said Handley.

Representatives from Tivic joined global thought leaders, military leaders and researchers to share insights, explore collaborative opportunities, and present ongoing research intended to improve health outcomes for warfighters exposed to radiation in the field.

About MHSRS

MHSRS serves as a dynamic platform for the exchange of research findings across multiple disciplines, including combat casualty care, medical countermeasures, infectious disease, and mental health. The symposium fosters collaboration among business leaders, scientists, clinicians, and policymakers, ensuring innovations reach those who serve as quickly and effectively as possible.

About Tivic

Tivic’s dual platform utilizes the body’s biopharmaceutical and bioelectronic systems to treat unmet medical needs through targeting the immune system.

Tivic’s biologics compounds activate an innate immune pathway to prevent cell death in the bone marrow and epithelial tissues across systems impacted by radiation and age. The company's lead drug candidate, Entolimod™ for acute radiation syndrome, is a novel TLR5 agonist that has been granted Fast Track designation and is in late stage development.

Tivic’s bioelectronic program is developing a novel, non-invasive medical device designed to target the neural pathways implicated in many prevalent and debilitating diseases. Early trials show promising signals that Tivic’s approach may regulate specific biologic responses, and the company believes its early-stage vagus nerve stimulation device has the potential to deliver clinical outcomes similar to or better than those of surgically implanted devices.

• TIVC surges 15% intraday to $4.025, rebounding from a $3.80 low to a $5.60 high.

• Turnover skyrockets to 37.6M shares, 3,476% above average.

• Company announces military radiation defense talks at MHSRS, sparking strategic optimism.

Tivic Health (TIVC) has ignited a dramatic 15% rally amid a volatile trading session, driven by a mix of regulatory engagement and biopharma pipeline updates. The stock’s sharp rebound from a $3.80 intraday low to a $5.60 high reflects investor speculation around its Entolimod program’s military applications. With turnover surging to 37.6M shares and a 52-week range of $2.43–$15.64, the move underscores a critical juncture for the biotech firm as it pivots toward biopharma.

Military Health Symposium Sparks Strategic Optimism

TIVC’s 15% intraday surge is directly tied to its participation in the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), where it advanced discussions with the DoD, BARDA, and AFRRI on Entolimod’s potential as a radiation countermeasure. The company’s leadership highlighted Entolimod’s Fast Track designation and its alignment with military health priorities, fueling speculation about future contracts or funding. Additionally, the stock’s rebound follows a Q2 earnings call announcement, which investors interpreted as a transparency boost. While the ClearUP product line’s revenue decline remains a drag, the biopharma pivot has rekindled speculative interest.

Biotechnology Sector Mixed as AMGN Leads

The biotech sector showed mixed momentum, with Amgen (AMGN) rising 1.18% as a sector leader. TIVC’s 15% rally outperformed peers like Biomerica (BMRA, -11.68%) and Trinity Biotech (TRIB, -19.37%), reflecting its unique focus on military biopharma. However, the broader sector’s cautious tone, driven by regulatory risks and R&D setbacks, limits TIVC’s upside unless Entolimod’s pipeline gains concrete validation.

Technical Divergence and ETF Correlation Analysis

• 200-day average: $2.355 (well below current price)

• RSI: 32.62 (oversold territory)

• MACD: -0.152 (bearish signal)

• Bollinger Bands: Price at $4.025 near lower band ($2.866)

TIVC’s technicals present a paradox: the RSI suggests oversold conditions, while the MACD and 200-day average indicate a long-term downtrend. A short-term bounce above the $4.48 upper Bollinger Band could trigger a 5–7% rally, but the 200-day MA at $2.355 remains a critical support level. Given the absence of leveraged ETFs and a void in options liquidity, traders should focus on swing trading setups. A breakout above $4.48 could validate bullish momentum, while a retest of the $3.675 middle Bollinger Band offers a risk-managed entry. The lack of options data precludes precise contract recommendations, but a 5% upside scenario (targeting $4.226) suggests limited upside potential for hypothetical calls.

Backtest Tivic Health Stock Performance

The 15% intraday surge in TIVC has historically led to mixed short-to-medium-term performance. While the win rates for 3 to 10 days following the surge are relatively high, indicating a higher probability of positive returns in the immediate aftermath, the overall returns over 30 days and the maximum return during this period suggest that the surge may not always translate into sustained long-term gains.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-15 12:56:19.767510

(Nasdaq: TIVC), a diversified therapeutics company, is proud to announce it advanced discussions with key US Government agencies through its participation in the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), held August 4-7, 2025, in Kissimmee, Florida. The MHSRS is the Department of Defense’s premier scientific meeting that brings together military, academic, and industry experts to discuss medical research and innovation in support of warfighter health and readiness.

Direct Access to DoD Decision-Makers and Researchers

MHSRS provides direct access to organizations seeking military partnerships and connects companies with key funding organizations. Tivic’s President of Biopharma and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Handley, met with key members of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) and the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC) to discuss potential pathways to deploy Entolimod as a military countermeasure.

BARDA’s mission is to develop medical countermeasures that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. AFRRI’s mission is to defend the Nation from nuclear and radiological threats through research, leadership, training, and education. The MCDC was formed in response to the US Government’s expressed interest to engage and fund advanced development efforts to support the Department of Defense’s (DoD) medical pharmaceutical and diagnostic requirements as related to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel.

""It was an honor to contribute to the vital conversations that were focused generally on radiation medical countermeasures, and specifically on our lead clinical product candidate, Entolimod, which has the potential to protect the warfighter in the instance that they are exposed to radiation,"" said Handley.

Representatives from Tivic joined global thought leaders, military leaders and researchers to share insights, explore collaborative opportunities, and present ongoing research intended to improve health outcomes for warfighters exposed to radiation in the field.

About MHSRS

MHSRS serves as a dynamic platform for the exchange of research findings across multiple disciplines, including combat casualty care, medical countermeasures, infectious disease, and mental health. The symposium fosters collaboration among business leaders, scientists, clinicians, and policymakers, ensuring innovations reach those who serve as quickly and effectively as possible.

About Tivic

Tivic’s dual platform utilizes the body’s biopharmaceutical and bioelectronic systems to treat unmet medical needs through targeting the immune system.

Tivic’s biologics compounds activate an innate immune pathway to prevent cell death in the bone marrow and epithelial tissues across systems impacted by radiation and age. The company's lead drug candidate, Entolimod™ for acute radiation syndrome, is a novel TLR5 agonist that has been granted Fast Track designation and is in late stage development.

Tivic’s bioelectronic program is developing a novel, non-invasive medical device designed to target the neural pathways implicated in many prevalent and debilitating diseases. Early trials show promising signals that Tivic’s approach may regulate specific biologic responses, and the company believes its early-stage vagus nerve stimulation device has the potential to deliver clinical outcomes similar to or better than those of surgically implanted devices.

​LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Zynex, Inc.

Zynex investors that lost money on their investment are encouraged to contact Lesley Portnoy, Esq.

Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: info@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants artificially inflated Zynex’s stock price by issuing, or causing to be issued, false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. In particular, Defendants concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” under which Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, including electrode pads and batteries, to patients and billed insurers for amounts far exceeding what was necessary. These undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare—the federal health insurer for the military—which accounted for approximately 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue.

The truth began to emerge on March 11, 2025, when Zynex issued a press release announcing its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results, disclosing a significant revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealing that “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The disclosure that Tricare—representing a substantial portion of the Company’s revenue—was scrutinizing prior claims threatened Zynex’s financial stability.

On March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share, erasing significant shareholder value and reflecting the market’s reaction to the Company’s previously undisclosed regulatory and financial risks.

Note, if any doctor gives you a prescription that is non formulary and he fails to request authorization, or authorization is denied, you cannot get it at a VA or mil pharmacy, and would pay retail

​LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Zynex, Inc. (“Zynex” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ:ZYXI) investors that the firm has initiated an investigation into possible securities fraud and may file a class action on behalf of investors. Zynex investors that lost money on their investment are encouraged to contact Lesley Portnoy, Esq.

Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: info@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants artificially inflated Zynex’s stock price by issuing, or causing to be issued, false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. In particular, Defendants concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” under which Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, including electrode pads and batteries, to patients and billed insurers for amounts far exceeding what was necessary. These undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare—the federal health insurer for the military—which accounted for approximately 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue.

The truth began to emerge on March 11, 2025, when Zynex issued a press release announcing its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results, disclosing a significant revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealing that “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The disclosure that Tricare—representing a substantial portion of the Company’s revenue—was scrutinizing prior claims threatened Zynex’s financial stability.

On March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share, erasing significant shareholder value and reflecting the market’s reaction to the Company’s previously undisclosed regulatory and financial risks.

This marks a key milestone in the evolution of the tool for providing safe and effective weapons training that protects warfighters from blast-related injury – thereby improving their readiness, resilience and effectiveness on the battlefield.

The BOP Tool’s library now includes blast exposure profiles for all fifteen weapons systems designated as “Tier 1” by the Defense Health Agency in its landmark 2023 medical study of the health effects of blast exposure on service members. This category consists of the shoulder mounted and .50 caliber weapons, indirect fire systems, and breachers used most regularly by the armed services.

“This is an important milestone, because now the BOP Tool is available to inform critical military training decisions,” says Dr. Raj Gupta, BIRCO’s deputy director. “This accomplishment would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Uniformed Services University’s Combat and Training Queryable Exposure/Event Repository project, and our other partners.”

BIRCO director Col. Matthew Scherer and Gupta co-moderated a breakout session on “Blast Overpressure Exposure and Blast Induced TBI Mechanism, Prevention, and Treatment” at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium in Kissimmee, Florida Aug. 4-7. The session featured updates on research from across the DOD on protecting brain health from the effects of the shock waves caused by the firing of heavy weapons. Gupta and his BIRCO colleagues also presented several posters on the BOP Tool and the health risks associated with blast exposure during MHSRS. They were among over 200 DHA R&D-MRDC experts in military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine who attended the annual event, the DOD's premier medical science research and development meeting. To see photos of DHA R&D-MRDC’s participation in this year’s MHSRS, visit the event’s Flickr album.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that repeated exposure to shock waves from the firing of heavy weapons, called blast overpressure, contributes to impaired cognitive, sensory, and motor performance, degraded reaction time and decision-making ability, and other adverse health effects. To help address this concern, in 2017 Congress instructed the Secretary of Defense to undertake a medical study of blast overpressure exposure on service members. BIRCO supported the effort by collecting and analyzing available information and emerging research on the health and performance effects of blast overpressure resulting from the firing of heavy weapons and explosions. The analysis identified a gap in how information about blast overpressure exposure is communicated to service members.

The BOP Tool provides training range managers, range safety officers, and instructors with easy-to-understand guidance on how to position personnel to minimize their exposure to blast overpressure from shoulder-mounted assault weapons, indirect fire systems, rifles, machine guns, and breaching charges. Users can place computer models of the shock wave patterns of individual weapons into a model of the training environment to see how the shock waves will interact with terrain and obstacles, allowing them to identify the safety risks associated with various locations around the weapon.

The BOP Tool traces its origins back to 2018, when the National Defense Authorization Act instructed the Secretary of Defense to conduct an extensive medical study of the physical effects of exposure to blast overpressure caused by certain weapon systems. BIRCO partnered with DHA's Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence, the Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command, the Defense Centers for Public Health - Aberdeen and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to conduct the study.

BIRCO adapted computer models of blast exposures originally developed for a prototype software application that standardized the descriptions of blast wave exposure zones. These models were refined with blast overpressure exposure data collected by WRAIR from wearable sensors and pressure probes during live fire training. The result was a set of accurate 3D simulations of blast exposures on human bodies as well as 2D maps of the blast radius at various pressures.

BIRCO is also collaborating with the Army and Marine Corps to integrate the BOP Tool into the Range Management Toolkit, a suite of advanced geospatial applications that is used to plan safe range exercises – for example, by reducing the threat of injury from projectile fragmentation. Currently, the RMTK suite does not address blast overpressure exposure mitigation.

“The integration of the BOP Tool into the RMTK will enhance safety management by enabling commanders and range managers to plan training exercises more effectively,” explains Gupta. “It allows the operational community to model and assess predicted blast overpressure exposure to inform deliberate adjustments to firing locations, personal positions, firing sequence, and training plans to minimize blast effects and protect their cognitive and physical health.”

Scherer says the functionalities of the BOP Tool address critical gaps identified by the operational community. “From our conversations with the operational end users, we understand that line leaders require objective data to inform their risk management decisions around BOP exposure,” says Scherer. “The BOP Tool helps guide unit leadership as they balance the priority of sustaining unit lethality through routine heavy weapons training with the potential for compromising readiness through overexposure to blast overpressure.”

The BOP Tool will enable the operational community to increase their awareness of blast overpressure exposure effects, and to reinforce the safety warnings warfighters first learned during their initial training. It will also inform range modernization and future weapon design by providing information about predicted exposures in training environment. The BOP Tool’s blast exposure predictions can also be used to inform health and performance assessments and clinical decision-making. Such applications promise to improve the DOD’s understanding of blast overpressure exposure effects.

“The next step is to roll out the BOP Tool to warfighters, instructors, and range managers to start using it, which is expected to happen soon,” says Gupta. “We have demonstrated the BOP Tool to the Marine Corps’ Range and Training Programs Division and the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, and we are in discussions with Army Combat Capabilities Development Command to establish an agreement to transfer the BOP Tool to end users. We are also providing access to the tool to the DEVCOM’s Armaments Center and Soldier Lethality office to enhance the BOP Tool with their existing weapon data. The addition of this high-quality data will further ensure the BOP Tool is as effective as it can be in mitigating unnecessary blast overpressure exposure effects on our warfighters.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9256548.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-14 18:56:18.317658

CACREP’s Gold Standard or Legal Overreach?

The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) has become the gatekeeper to licensure and top counseling jobs. A CACREP-accredited degree is now required to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Army, and the Tricare health system. In 27 states, CACREP is either the preferred or mandated route to becoming a licensed counselor. Its status is so dominant that non-accredited programs often claim to be “aligned with CACREP standards,” as a mark of legitimacy.

But as CACREP’s influence grows, so do the legal questions. Its recent push to limit the Counseling Compact—a multi-state agreement allowing counselors to practice across state lines—could violate federal antitrust laws. In this series, we’ll examine whether CACREP has crossed legal lines, what it means for the profession, and how the public could be paying the price.

A Letter Disappears

In September 2023, CACREP published a six-page open letter to the American Counseling Association (ACA), chastising it for characterizing CACREP’s efforts to limit the scope of who can work under the Counseling Compact as demanding and relentless. Within weeks of that letter being cited in my article at Minding the Campus, the document quietly vanished from CACREP’s website.

Initially, I assumed this was damage control. But as I dug deeper into the legal limitations on nonprofit organizations—and the red flags raised under the Sherman Antitrust Act—I began to reconsider. The more I learned, the more the letter read like a roadmap for monopolization.

Fortunately, I saved a copy, and shared it.

From Standard-Setter to Gatekeeper

Originally established to promote educational quality, CACREP has grown into the most powerful entity in the counseling field. Today, it accredits 983 programs across 473 institutions. Its standards influence who gets licensed, who gets hired, and—critically—who gets excluded.

In its own words, CACREP sees its mission as “promoting professional competence … through the development of preparation standards.” But those standards have become increasingly ideological, and exclusively required for licensure and employment. The requirement for 60 graduate credit hours—more than many master’s programs in medicine or engineering—is one such barrier. So is the insistence on a rigid “Professional Counselor” identity, narrowly defined by CACREP itself.

These standards aren’t just academic—they’re political. CACREP’s own standard and the resulting required textbooks reflect a specific Critical Social Justice, DEI orientation, including an explicit requirement for multiculturalism as foundational to counselor identity. Not all counselors or counseling programs agree with this direction, and some have declined CACREP accreditation as a result. Yet CACREP continues to lobby—though it avoids that word—for its definition to become the only acceptable one.

The Open Letter’s Demands

The 2023 letter laid out CACREP’s position clearly:

Those granted the Privilege to Practice in the Counseling Compact should be licensed as Professional Counselors and not in other professions.

It referenced a 2010 report produced through collaboration with CACREP, the ACA, the National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC), American Association of State Counseling Boards (AASCB), the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (ACES), and other organizations. That report reiterated the ideological foundations of counseling, and called for the formation of a “Professional Counselor identity”—a concept CACREP developed and implemented into its standard, including in curriculum and philosophical priorities.

The letter further insisted that states should reserve Compact privileges for those who mirror CACREP’s standards, even while claiming to “respect each state’s prerogative” to set licensure rules. This doublespeak—publicly endorsing state control while privately urging uniform exclusion of anything short of the CACREP standard—raises concerns not just of ethical overreach, but of legal misconduct.

[RELATED: Psychology Has Been Overtaken by a Dangerous and Pervasive Ideology]

The Risk to Competition

Why does this matter? Because under federal law, especially the Sherman Antitrust Act, group efforts to restrain trade or dominate a market can be illegal. Section 1 prohibits collusion between organizations to exclude competitors. Section 2 forbids monopolization or attempts to monopolize a market.

CACREP is not a government agency. It is a private nonprofit—one whose decisions can determine how much a degree costs, who will be recruited, who can teach, what’s in the curriculum, and what loans are available to pay tuition.

Its coordination with licensing bodies, credentialing boards, professional organizations and educators creates a closed loop that increasingly shuts out competition, not on the basis of quality, but conformity.

Its swift removal of the open letter suggests CACREP knows the risks. The questions now are: Has it gone too far? And who pays the price?

What’s at Stake

When a single accreditor dominates a profession, it limits not just career mobility but public access to care. Counselors who train through other reputable programs—some with different theoretical orientations or less ideological coursework—find themselves locked out of licensure, jobs, and now even interstate practice.

Meanwhile, clients face fewer choices in a time of unprecedented demand for mental health services.

In Part Two, we’ll explore how CACREP’s dominance may violate antitrust laws—and why it’s time for lawmakers and professional organizations to take a closer look at who sets the standards, and why.

Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety.","If you have TRICARE For Life, you’ll get health care from Medicare providers. Here’s what you need to know about finding different types of Medicare providers.

“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager. “Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your Military Identification Card at any medical appointment.”

How do I find the right provider?

TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. You can see three types of providers. This is described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

• Medicare participating providers. They accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment. Seeing these providers will result in the lowest costs.

• Medicare non-participating providers. They don’t accept the Medicare amount as full payment. They can charge up to 15% more than Medicare allows. TRICARE covers this extra cost.

• Opt-out providers. They don’t work with Medicare at all. You’ll pay much more when you see these providers. Medicare won’t pay anything. TRICARE only pays what it normally would. This is about 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge. You pay the rest.

How do Medicare and TRICARE pay?

Medicare is generally your primary payer. Are you seeing a Medicare participating or Medicare non-participating provider? If so, then you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TFL. Most healthcare services fall into this category. Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.

Sometimes, TRICARE is your primary insurance. In this case, you must see TRICARE-authorized providers. This occurs when:

• Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

• You’re in overseas locations.

Can I get Department of Defense care?

You can get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

How does Department of Veterans Affairs care work?

VA providers can’t bill Medicare. If you see a VA provider for care that isn’t related to a service-connected condition, you’ll pay about 80% of the bill. TRICARE only pays up to 20%. Want to see a VA provider? Call the TFL contractor, WPS Military and Veterans Health, at 866-773-0404 to check your coverage before you go.

What about care Overseas?

Do you live overseas? You can usually see any civilian provider. You’ll need to pay up front and file your own claim. In the Philippines, you must see certified providers.

For emergencies overseas, try military hospitals first. If none are available, go to the nearest emergency care facility. Call the TRICARE Overseas regional call center within 24 hours if you’re admitted.

How do I get emergency and urgent care?

When getting emergency or urgent care, always show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card.

Do you need emergency care? Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Do you need urgent care? Urgent care treats conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t life-threatening. Examples include sprains or rising fevers.

Are virtual health care visits covered?

You can get virtual health care via phone or video appointments. Medicare covers these visits when your provider accepts Medicare. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover the virtual health service.

Is mental health care covered?

Medicare covers visits with these mental health providers:

• Psychiatrists and other doctors

• Clinical psychologists

• Clinical social workers

• Clinical nurse specialists

• Nurse practitioners

• Physician assistants

What about services that need pre-authorization?

Some services need pre-authorization before you get care. These include:

• Dental care for medical conditions

• Home health care

• Hospice care

• Organ transplants

• Some prescription drugs

Contact WPS if you have questions about pre-authorization requirements.

Remember! Seeing Medicare participating providers gives you the lowest out-of-pocket costs.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9257080/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-14 15:56:15.116526

The analysis identified a gap in how information about blast overpressure exposure is communicated to Service Members.
Currently, the RMTK suite does not address blast overpressure exposure mitigation.
Such applications promise to improve the DOD’s understanding of blast overpressure exposure effects.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – The Blast Overpressure Tool, an application developed by the DOD Blast Injury Research Coordinating Office to help minimize Warfighters’ exposure to the shock waves created by the firing of heavy weapons, now incorporates data on the DOD’s highest-priority weapons systems and is ready for use in training activities. This marks a key milestone in the evolution of the tool for providing safe and effective weapons training that protects Warfighters from blast-related injury – thereby improving their readiness, resilience and effectiveness on the battlefield.

The BOP Tool’s library now includes blast exposure profiles for all fifteen weapons systems designated as “Tier 1” by the Defense Health Agency in its landmark 2023 medical study of the health effects of blast exposure on Service Members. This category consists of the shoulder mounted and .50 caliber weapons, indirect fire systems, and breachers used most regularly by the armed services.

“This is an important milestone, because now the BOP Tool is available to inform critical military training decisions,” says Dr. Raj Gupta, BIRCO’s deputy director. “This accomplishment would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Uniformed Services University’s Combat and Training Queryable Exposure/Event Repository project, and our other partners.”

BIRCO director Col. Matthew Scherer and Gupta co-moderated a breakout session on “Blast Overpressure Exposure and Blast Induced TBI Mechanism, Prevention, and Treatment” at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium in Kissimmee, Florida Aug. 4-7. The session featured updates on research from across the DOD on protecting brain health from the effects of the shock waves caused by the firing of heavy weapons. Gupta and his BIRCO colleagues also presented several posters on the BOP Tool and the health risks associated with blast exposure during MHSRS. They were among over 200 DHA R&D-MRDC experts in military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine who attended the annual event, the DOD's premier medical science research and development meeting. To see photos of DHA R&D-MRDC’s participation in this year’s MHSRS, visit the event’s Flickr album.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that repeated exposure to shock waves from the firing of heavy weapons, called blast overpressure, contributes to impaired cognitive, sensory, and motor performance, degraded reaction time and decision-making ability, and other adverse health effects. To help address this concern, in 2017 Congress instructed the Secretary of Defense to undertake a medical study of blast overpressure exposure on Service Members. BIRCO supported the effort by collecting and analyzing available information and emerging research on the health and performance effects of blast overpressure resulting from the firing of heavy weapons and explosions. The analysis identified a gap in how information about blast overpressure exposure is communicated to Service Members.

The BOP Tool provides training range managers, range safety officers, and instructors with easy-to-understand guidance on how to position personnel to minimize their exposure to blast overpressure from shoulder-mounted assault weapons, indirect fire systems, rifles, machine guns, and breaching charges. Users can place computer models of the shock wave patterns of individual weapons into a model of the training environment to see how the shock waves will interact with terrain and obstacles, allowing them to identify the safety risks associated with various locations around the weapon.

The BOP Tool traces its origins back to 2018, when the National Defense Authorization Act instructed the Secretary of Defense to conduct an extensive medical study of the physical effects of exposure to blast overpressure caused by certain weapon systems. BIRCO partnered with DHA's Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence, the Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command, the Defense Centers for Public Health - Aberdeen and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to conduct the study.

BIRCO adapted computer models of blast exposures originally developed for a prototype software application that standardized the descriptions of blast wave exposure zones. These models were refined with blast overpressure exposure data collected by WRAIR from wearable sensors and pressure probes during live fire training. The result was a set of accurate 3D simulations of blast exposures on human bodies as well as 2D maps of the blast radius at various pressures.

BIRCO is also collaborating with the Army and Marine Corps to integrate the BOP Tool into the Range Management Toolkit, a suite of advanced geospatial applications that is used to plan safe range exercises – for example, by reducing the threat of injury from projectile fragmentation. Currently, the RMTK suite does not address blast overpressure exposure mitigation.

“The integration of the BOP Tool into the RMTK will enhance safety management by enabling commanders and range managers to plan training exercises more effectively,” explains Gupta. “It allows the operational community to model and assess predicted blast overpressure exposure to inform deliberate adjustments to firing locations, personal positions, firing sequence, and training plans to minimize blast effects and protect their cognitive and physical health.”

Scherer says the functionalities of the BOP Tool address critical gaps identified by the operational community.

“From our conversations with the operational end users, we understand that line leaders require objective data to inform their risk management decisions around BOP exposure,” says Scherer. “The BOP Tool helps guide unit leadership as they balance the priority of sustaining unit lethality through routine heavy weapons training with the potential for compromising readiness through overexposure to blast overpressure.”

The BOP Tool will enable the operational community to increase their awareness of blast overpressure exposure effects, and to reinforce the safety warnings Warfighters first learned during their initial training. It will also inform range modernization and future weapon design by providing information about predicted exposures in training environment. The BOP Tool’s blast exposure predictions can also be used to inform health and performance assessments and clinical decision-making. Such applications promise to improve the DOD’s understanding of blast overpressure exposure effects.

“The next step is to roll out the BOP Tool to Warfighters, instructors, and range managers to start using it, which is expected to happen soon,” says Gupta. “We have demonstrated the BOP Tool to the Marine Corps’ Range and Training Programs Division and the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, and we are in discussions with Army Combat Capabilities Development Command to establish an agreement to transfer the BOP Tool to end users. We are also providing access to the tool to the DEVCOM’s Armaments Center and Soldier Lethality office to enhance the BOP Tool with their existing weapon data. The addition of this high-quality data will further ensure the BOP Tool is as effective as it can be in mitigating unnecessary blast overpressure exposure effects on our Warfighters.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9256548/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-14 10:56:16.746321

The company's SaaS-based healthcare platform connects patients with doctors over secure video.

American Well Corporation (AMWL), a leading SaaS-based healthcare platform provider, reported its Q2 2025 financial performance, highlighting improved revenue growth and a hold rating maintained despite concerns over the renewal of its contract with the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA). The company's platform connects patients with doctors over secure video, facilitating virtual care services.

Revenue for Q2 2025 was $70.9 million, marking a 13% year-over-year (YoY) increase from $66.8 million in Q1 2025 [1]. This growth is a positive indicator for the company's ability to expand its service offerings and customer base. However, the extension of the DHA contract by only one year, instead of the anticipated three-year period, raised concerns about long-term performance stability [1].

The DHA contract, a significant growth initiative for Amwell, was extended by one year due to budget restrictions within the Department of Defense (DoD). This extension excluded deployments for Amwell's behavioral health and automated care programs, leading to a downward revision of the 2025 revenue guidance from $250 million to $245 million to $250 million [1].

Despite the revenue growth, Amwell continues to face challenges in achieving profitability. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA of -$4.7 million for Q2 2025, representing a significant improvement from the -$35 million reported in Q1 2024. However, the ongoing negative EBITDA suggests that the company is still operating at a loss [1].

The company's cost reduction efforts are evident in the Q2 2025 results. Research and development spending was reduced by 12.2% YoY to $18.3 million, while sales and marketing expenses were 32% lower than last year at $12.5 million. General and administrative expenses were also reduced by 25.7% compared to Q2 2024 [1].

While these cost reductions are aimed at achieving the company's goal of positive cash flow from operations by 2026, there are risks associated with deep or sustained cuts. Reduced investment in R&D and marketing could limit the company's ability to innovate and maintain brand visibility, potentially leading to a loss of market share and customer touchpoints [1].

The addition of Florida Blue as a new payer is a positive development that could provide more predictable revenue streams for Amwell. The company also launched Amwell Navigate, an AI-powered client experience platform, during the quarter. The platform is designed to empower clients and enable cost-effective delivery of quality support at scale [1].

Despite the positive developments, the company's financial position remains a concern. Amwell reported a quarterly cash burn of $3 million in Q2 2025, and its cash reserves have been depleting year over year. The company's valuation, as measured by EV/EBITDA, is currently non-meaningful due to its negative EBITDA, contrasting sharply with the high valuation of Teladoc (TDOC) [1].

In conclusion, American Well Corporation reported improved Q2 2025 financial performance, with revenue growth and cost reductions driving the results. However, concerns over the DHA contract renewal and the company's ongoing unprofitability remain significant. Investors should continue to monitor the company's financial position and the impact of its new initiatives on future performance.

In June 2025, the Defense Health Agency added new training requirements for healthcare providers on toxic exposures and burn pits.

On Aug. 1, 2024, the VA launched a redesigned registry after extensive feedback showing veterans found it too challenging to enroll in the program. The new registry helps inform efforts to improve benefits as part of the PACT Act of 2022, also known as the “Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act.”

The VA and the DOD also expanded PACT Act benefits and VA health care for service members and veterans who served in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, as well as related operations in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and the Vietnam War.

Key updates to the registry include:

Automatic enrollment of more than 4.7 million veterans and service members who meet the expanded eligibility criteria based on DOD manpower and deployment records

Information from all military-exposure databases

Removal of a 144-question survey required to participate in the registry

Establishment of an easy opt-out process for enrollees

New Training Required

The new DHA training is for healthcare providers at all military hospitals and clinics. It’s called the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Overview.” The training is in accordance with the requirements of Section 725 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.

Under the guidance, healthcare providers must complete the one-hour Joint Knowledge Online training course if they have not already done so. It also requires providers to review the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry DoD Health Care Provider Clinical Toolbox.”

Provider Training Updates

The updated training includes expanded information about:

AHOBPR eligibility criteria and the new auto-enrollment process

Clinical content such as recommended diagnostic codes and how to manage patient encounters related to airborne hazards and open burn pit exposures

Information about the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, and new information on the Military Health Systems’ Periodic Occupational and Environmental Monitoring Summary. Both the web-based ILER and the monitoring summaries of POEMS track and manage exposure data.

For medical personnel seeking more information on deployment-related environmental exposures, continuing education-eligible training is offered by the VA’s War Related Illness and Injury Study Center.

The resource contains:

Background information on airborne hazards and the registry

Guidance for conducting a medical evaluation associated with environmental exposure concerns

Resources for providers to review and share with service members and other healthcare providers to improve health outcomes for those exposed

Educational materials regarding military exposures are regularly updated, so providers should plan to check in for any changes in guidance.

(NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share.

The stock’s performance coincided with a high-profile legal ruling involving its subsidiary, Omnicare. A federal judge ordered CVS and Omnicare to pay $949 million in damages and penalties following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing practices. The case, which spanned nearly a decade, centered on allegations that Omnicare dispensed drugs without valid prescriptions in long-term care facilities and submitted false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The court’s decision trebled damages to $500 million and added $449 million in penalties, marking one of the largest False Claims Act verdicts in recent history. CVS faces ongoing legal challenges as Omnicare seeks to overturn the jury’s verdict, with potential appeals likely.

The ruling highlights regulatory and financial risks for healthcare companies operating in complex reimbursement environments. As the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the U.S., CVS’s exposure to legal disputes involving billing practices could impact investor sentiment. While the company maintains a strong market position, the judgment underscores the importance of compliance in an industry subject to rigorous oversight.

DETROIT — Two individuals were charged for their involvement in a $500 million, nationwide scheme that involved billing Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and other health insurance programs for COVID-19 testing services that were never rendered, United States Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. announced today.

Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik of Boca Raton Florida, and Dr. Martin Perlin of Fairfield, Connecticut were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 substantive counts of health care fraud. Biricik was the sole member and Chief Executive Officer of Fast Lab Technologies, LLC (Fast Lab). Dr. Perlin was Fast Lab’s Medical Director and provider responsible for ordering the majority of the tests. Both defendants were arrested this morning.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests. When individuals went to the website to order tests, they were asked to provide their insurance information. Fast Lab then used this insurance information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and numerous private insurances for both antigen (“rapid”) and PCR (“laboratory) tests, across multiple dates for each beneficiary. Specifically, Fast Lab’s claims represented that (1) the antigen tests had been observed by medical professionals, (2) saliva samples were collected by medical professionals, and (3) PCR testing was performed on those samples. In reality, the vast majority of antigen tests—if taken at all—were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals; saliva samples were never collected nor returned to Fast Lab; and PCR testing was never performed. Dr. Perlin was the ordering physician for these tests, despite not having a treating relationship with the beneficiaries. Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries. In total, Biricik billed or caused to be billed more than $500 million in claims and was paid more than $50 million.

Gorgon was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Karen Wingerd, Detroit Field Office, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Chicago Regional Office; Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit Division; Special Agent in Charge Derek M.

By Mr. Thomas Cieslak

One team’s attention to detail and meticulous execution of their duties plays a critical role in supporting the healthcare of Marines, Sailors and families of Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point while ensuring service members are ready to train and deploy.

Staff of the Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point Patient Administration Department conduct their duties out-of-sight of most visitors to the facility. They ensure the accuracy, accessibility and confidentiality of patient medical records and sensitive patient administrative information.

“It’s more than filing paperwork. Many may think Patient Administration is just about filing records or checking patients in,” said Ms. Cindy Godley, the clinic’s Medical Records Administrator and Assistant Department Head. “In reality, it involves complex processes like medical board coordination, coding audits, proper registration processes, and HIPAA compliance, all of which are vital to patient care and organizational readiness.”

Staff serving in the PAD support a multitude of functions critical to the clinic’s function, the wellness of patients and the deployment readiness of units assigned to MCAS Cherry Point. Those functions include management of Limited Duty, coordinating the process to determine a service member’s fitness for duty, managing overseas screenings and even assisting mortuary affairs.

“We are the gatekeepers of patient data,” said Godley, a native of Havelock, North Carolina. “The department [PAD] ensures data accuracy, privacy, and legal compliance. A single error in documentation or patient eligibility could impact treatment, billing, or readiness for deployment—especially in military healthcare systems.”

Additionally, PAD’s work protects the clinic from numerous risks. The department prevents financial and legal issues through careful oversight of records requests, third-party liability, coding documentation verifications and maintaining Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance. PAD staff helps the clinic avoid penalties, litigation or lost revenue due to noncompliance or incomplete documentation.

“We are an essential part to continuity of care. From birth to end-of-life, we assist with ensuring documentation is available for the next patient’s visit, either in our clinic or at other facilities,” said Godley. “Patient Administration tracks the full lifecycle of medical care. Without it, care would be delayed, incomplete, or undocumented.”

Though often in the background of all patient interactions, PAD ensures the smooth provision of medical care to the MCAS Cherry Point and surrounding communities.

The negative implication of this, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, prohibits states from unjustifiably discriminating against interstate commerce.
The judge granted the preliminary injunction, and Arkansas Act 624 is currently blocked from taking effect until the case is ultimately decided.","Last month, we wrote about the CVS, Express Scripts, and Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) lawsuit challenging Arkansas Act 624—a law prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in Arkansas. At the end of July, a federal district court judge granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, blocking the law from taking effect until a final disposition in the case has been made.

Arkansas Act 624

The Act, the first of its kind, was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026. However, the plaintiffs alleged that Arkansas Act 624 is unconstitutional and violates the Commerce Clause and other provisions. They asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the law. After hearing arguments from both parties, the district court judge issued a 17-page opinion.

Court Sides With Plaintiffs

“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,” noted the judge. “A party seeking a preliminary injunction must prove that: (1) there is a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (3) the harm to the movant, if the injunction is denied, outweighs the harm to the non-movant if the injunction is granted; and (4) an injunction is in the public’s interest.”

To determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the judge considered the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their argument. The plaintiffs made many different arguments as to why they believed the law was unconstitutional. While the judge rejected the bulk of these arguments, he ultimately agreed that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on 2 claims—one involving the Commerce Clause and the other involving a Supremacy Clause claim related to TRICARE preemption.

The Commerce Clause

The Commerce Clause seeks to ensure free trade among the states. The negative implication of this, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, prohibits states from unjustifiably discriminating against interstate commerce. “Act 624 appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interest,” wrote the judge. “This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ “business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business.”

The Supremacy Clause

The Supremacy Clause provides “that the Constitution and the laws passed pursuant to it are the supreme laws of the land, binding alike upon states, courts, and the people, ‘anything in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.’” The purpose is to prevent confusion and conflicts between state and federal law. Thus, state laws that interfere with or contradict federal law are invalid. The plaintiffs argued that Act 624 interferes with and contradicts 3 federal laws: (1) TRICARE (health insurance for service members), (2) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and (3) Medicare. While the judge rejected the ERISA and Medicare arguments, he agreed that Act 624 is explicitly and impliedly preempted by TRICARE.

“TRICARE contains an express preemption clause that overrides any ‘law or regulation of a State or local government relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods’ that is ‘inconsistent with’ or ‘necessary to implement or administer’ the TRICARE program,” wrote the judge.

The judge granted the preliminary injunction, and Arkansas Act 624 is currently blocked from taking effect until the case is ultimately decided.

Clinicians were spending a lot of time researching product specifications and vendor pricing before filling out paperwork to order prosthetic limb components for their patients. What if the process could be streamlined?

The Hearing Center of Excellence led the way with hearing device ordering through VA DLC. They established a way to allow DHA providers to order needed items through VA DLC contracts. In 2018, EACE followed in their footsteps by partnering with VA in a pilot project allowing online ordering of lower-extremity prosthetic componentry. It standardized ordering processes, improved efficiency, and tremendously reduced the administrative burden on clinicians. The pilot was a huge success.

Good news for providers and patients

In 2021, DHA launched the new ordering process at its three advanced rehabilitation centers, helping providers order components as easily as they could order a sandwich online. Ordered parts now arrive quickly in these military hospitals and clinics, often within just a few days. “Use of the ordering process off a VA contract allows clinicians to order exactly the parts they need for scheduled procedures,” said Miller. “It saves time, giving them more time with patients and relieving some of their administrative work.”

This means good news for patients, too. Knowing when a part will be available makes it easier to schedule timely appointments. Fitting patients with prosthetic devices quickly can improve their ability to adapt to the new device. A clinician’s ability to swiftly order and receive a prosthetic device helps their patients in recovery.

Combat support and readiness

DHA and VA DLC set up their contract to be modified throughout the year. This flexibility, coupled with close collaboration, means requests from the three ARCs can be incorporated quickly into the VA DLC catalog of products. In turn, this means DHA providers can offer patients the newest commercially available items.

This has implications for readiness, too. Staying on the cutting edge of technology keeps DHA clinicians’ skills sharp, ready to be put to good use whenever and wherever they’re needed.

In addition, the ordering process is scalable, which helps DHA respond to changing needs in combat support. The system is set up to make it easy to order one part or 10,000. This is a radical departure from how the system worked ago.

The new scalability ensures DHA can have components available to clinicians when and where they’re needed. End-to-end, this process supports healthcare personnel in their readiness mission and supports service members who are approved to return to active duty.

What does the future hold?

The two departments are constantly exploring ways to improve, for example, making the once-laborious process of returns and recalls easier. VA also recently awarded a contract to expand options for lower-extremity devices. According to Miller, the collaboration between DHA and VA continues to expand as the partnership deepens. “VA has been a great partner for us,” said Miller. “I sit on the technical committee and consult on items that we need in DHA, and VA is very responsive. There are things we need more of here in DHA, and VA listens and responds to those needs.”

From faster access to devices to improved clinician satisfaction, the prosthetic component ordering system is delivering tangible benefits. This collaborative approach exemplifies how federal partnerships improve the lives of service members and enhance military readiness.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9157989.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-13 22:56:17.607887

Chronic fatigue is a symptom of many conditions, while Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multi system illness. ME/CFS often occurs after infections but the pathogenesis is not certain. The syndrome ""Long COVID"" may be a subset of ME/CFS or a distinct condition. An array of symptoms is required for ME/CFS diagnosis, with the most distinctive symptom being post-exertional malaise (PEM). ME/CFS cannot be improved by exercise or psychiatric treatment.

For those seeking exposure to the AI-driven healthcare revolution, Amwell offers a strategic and resilient investment opportunity.","The digital health sector is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by macroeconomic pressures, regulatory changes, and the relentless march of artificial intelligence. For American Well (AMWL), a company deeply embedded in the U.S. military healthcare ecosystem and the broader telehealth market, these forces have created both headwinds and opportunities. The recent revisions to its contract with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) have forced a recalibration of its business model, but the company's strategic pivot toward AI-driven efficiency and high-margin subscription software positions it as a compelling long-term investment.

Navigating DHA Contract Revisions: A Test of Resilience

In 2025, Amwell extended its partnership with the DHA to modernize the Military Health System (MHS) through its virtual care platform. However, the revised contract excluded behavioral health and automated care programs—a $180 million initiative—due to budget constraints tied to the Trump administration's spending cuts. This exclusion directly impacted Amwell's revenue guidance, which was revised downward to $245–$250 million for 2025, from $250–$260 million. Adjusted EBITDA losses also narrowed slightly, from a projected $55–$45 million to $50–$45 million, reflecting cost-cutting measures such as workforce reductions and operational streamlining.

While these changes are a near-term drag, they underscore Amwell's ability to adapt. The company's CEO, Ido Schoenberg, has emphasized that the exclusion of these programs is a function of broader fiscal constraints, not a critique of their value. Behavioral health and automated care have demonstrated measurable cost savings and improved patient outcomes, and their reintroduction in future contracts remains a distinct possibility. For investors, this highlights Amwell's resilience in navigating government contract volatility—a critical trait in a sector where public-sector clients often dictate growth trajectories.

AI-Driven Efficiency: A Catalyst for Long-Term Value

Amwell's response to the DHA revisions has been twofold: accelerating cost discipline and doubling down on AI-driven operational efficiency. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 12.2% reduction in R&D expenses and a narrowed adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.7 million, compared to $35 million in Q2 2024. These improvements were fueled by AI-powered tools that streamline clinical workflows, automate administrative tasks, and optimize resource allocation.

The company's AI initiatives are not just cost-saving measures—they are strategic enablers of growth. For instance, Amwell's platform has been integrated into the MHS's Digital First Program, which has already tripled virtual visits compared to the legacy system. AI is being used to enhance hybrid care models, reduce provider burnout, and improve patient engagement. Schoenberg has described the platform as a “force multiplier” for healthcare systems, a characterization that aligns with the broader industry's shift toward AI-augmented care delivery.

Subscription Model: A Path to Sustainable Margins

Amwell's pivot to a high-margin subscription software model is another pillar of its long-term value creation. In Q2 2025, subscription revenue grew 47% year-over-year to $40.4 million, accounting for 57% of total revenue. This shift is critical in a sector where recurring revenue provides stability amid the volatility of government contracts. The company's SaaS platform is now deployed across diverse clients, including the Military Entrance Processing Command, the U.S. Coast Guard, and commercial partners like Florida Blue.

The subscription model also positions Amwell to capitalize on the AI-driven healthcare transformation. As health systems prioritize cost-effective, scalable solutions, Amwell's platform offers a unified infrastructure for virtual care, AI-powered diagnostics, and data analytics. This aligns with industry trends: the global AI healthcare market is projected to grow from $15.1 billion in 2022 to $187.9 billion by 2030, a 37% CAGR. Amwell's early integration of AI into its workflows gives it a first-mover advantage in this high-growth segment.

Competitive Positioning and Risk Mitigation

Amwell's competitive edge lies in its ability to solve fragmentation in digital health. Unlike point solutions that address isolated aspects of care delivery, its platform integrates virtual visits, AI tools, and EHR interoperability into a cohesive ecosystem. This is particularly valuable for large clients like the DHA, which require seamless, scalable solutions. The company's partnership with Leidos to replace the MHS Video Connect system further cements its role as a key player in federal healthcare modernization.

However, risks remain. The DHA contract's exclusion of behavioral health programs highlights the vulnerability of government contracts to budgetary shifts. Additionally, the telehealth sector is highly competitive, with rivals like Teladoc Health and Doxy.me vying for market share. Yet, Amwell's focus on AI-driven efficiency and its strong balance sheet ($219 million in cash, zero debt) provide a buffer against these challenges.

Investment Thesis: A Buy for the Long-Term

For investors, Amwell represents a compelling case of strategic resilience. The company is navigating near-term headwinds with disciplined cost management and AI-driven innovation, while its subscription model and federal contracts provide a foundation for sustainable growth. Schoenberg's roadmap to positive cash flow by 2026, coupled with the AI healthcare market's explosive growth potential, suggests that Amwell is well-positioned to outperform in the long term.

The key risks—government budget volatility and competitive pressures—are mitigated by Amwell's diversified client base, recurring revenue model, and technological differentiation. While the stock may remain volatile in the short term, its fundamentals point to a strong value proposition for patient investors.

In a digital health landscape defined by rapid change, Amwell's ability to adapt and innovate is its greatest asset.

The companies were ordered to pay about $949 million in a settlement.

The case was initially filed in 2015 (the same year CVS acquired Omnicare) by a whistleblower: an Omnicare pharmacist who worked primarily in New Mexico. The whistleblower filed her suit under the False Claims Act (FCA) and state equivalents. These are laws that allow private individuals to file suit in the name of the U.S. (or states) and allege that healthcare programs like TRICARE, Medicare, or Medicaid are being defrauded. Whistleblowers are eligible to share in 15-30 percent of any ultimate recovery.

The crux of the allegations in this case is that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in various long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and charged Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE for those drugs. The allegations touch patients in more than 3,000 facilities. Allegedly, the prescriptions were automatically assigned new prescription numbers, refills were automatically authorized, and prescriptions were periodically refilled in bulk without confirming that the prescriptions were still medically necessary or authorized by a physician.

CVS, as Omnicare’s parent company, was accused of “causing” the false claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices, but failed to correct them.

The federal government and 29 states joined the case in 2019, and it went to trial this Spring, in New York. After the trial, the jury unanimously found about $135 million in damages and held both companies, Omnicare and CVS, liable for the conduct. This was one of the largest-ever jury verdicts under the FCA.

In July, the Judge trebled (tripled) damages, which is required under the law, upping the damages figure to nearly $500 million. In the same ruling, the Judge also imposed penalties, which the law allows to attach to every false claim. The penalty amount was roughly another $500 million, with CVS Omnicare being held to have liabilities of $949 million. Additional motions are pending, including requests by Omnicare to toss the jury’s verdict and by CVS to be removed from the case. After those are decided, an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is possible. Last month’s ruling is an important milestone, but this legal battle is likely far from over.",https://medlearnpublishing.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/elderly-drugstore-worker-holding-cup-of-coffee-whi-2025-02-19-10-21-48-utc-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-13 12:56:08.616514

Estimate Reviewed By David Newman Chief, Defense, International Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs Cost Estimates Unit Kathleen FitzGerald Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit","Bill Summary

H.R. 3838 would specify authorizations of appropriations totaling $884.3 billion for 2026. The bill also includes provisions that would affect the costs of defense programs that would be funded with discretionary appropriations in 2026 and future years. Those provisions mainly would affect force structure, compensation and benefits, and multiyear procurement of weapons systems. For 2026, those costs are included in the authorizations specified in the bill for that year. CBO expects that some costs after 2026 will be covered by specified authorizations in future National Defense Authorization Acts.

Estimated Federal Cost

The estimated budgetary effects of H.R. 3838 are shown in Table 1. Of the $884.3 billion authorized for 2026, nearly all—$882.9 billion—would be for activities within budget function 050 (national defense). The other $1.4 billion would fall within budget functions 270 (energy), 400 (transportation), and 700 (veterans benefits and services).

Basis of Estimate

For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 3838 will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2026 and that the authorized amounts will be appropriated in 2026. CBO estimates that appropriation of the specified amounts would increase outlays by $868.1 billion over the 2026-2035 period; those outlays were estimated using historical spending patterns for similar programs.

Spending Subject to Appropriation

H.R. 3838 would specifically authorize appropriations of $884.3 billion for 2026. Almost all of that amount—$882.9 billion—would be for defense programs; $1.4 billion would be for nondefense programs (see Table 2).

The amount authorized for defense programs in 2026 would be $9.6 billion (or 1 percent) less than the $892.6 billion in discretionary funding that was appropriated for defense in 2025. That 2025 appropriation includes $11.8 billion in funding that was designated as an emergency requirement—mostly for shipbuilding and expenses related to natural disasters. Excluding that emergency-designated funding, the amount authorized for 2026 would be $2.1 billion more than the amounts appropriated in 2025. (Those appropriated amounts also exclude the estimated $153.4 billion in mandatory budget authority that was provided for defense activities by Public Law 119-21, the 2025 reconciliation legislation enacted on July 4, 2025; those mandatory amounts are available for obligation through 2029.)

H.R. 3838 would increase authorizations for all major categories of defense spending except procurement. Authorizations would increase for the following categories:

military personnel by $11.5 billion (or 6 percent),

operation and maintenance and revolving funds by $0.5 billion (or less than 1 percent),

research and development by $1.7 billion (or 1 percent), military construction and family housing by $1.4 billion (or 8 percent), and

atomic energy activities by $0.8 billion (or 3 percent).

Authorizations would decrease for procurement by $13.7 billion (or 8 percent).

For nondefense programs, the bill would specifically authorize $1.4 billion in 2026. That amount includes $1.1 billion for the Maritime Administration, $163 million for a Department of Veterans Affairs medical-facility demonstration fund, $77 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and $13 million for the Naval Petroleum Reserves.

Estimated Costs for Selected Provisions for 2026 through 2030

H.R. 3838 includes provisions that would affect the costs of various defense programs in future years. The estimated effects of some of those provisions are shown in Table 3 and described below. Spending for affected programs and activities would be subject to the appropriation of the estimated amounts. The net costs of those defense-related provisions are not added to the total specified authorizations described above because CBO expects those activities would be funded from the amounts specifically authorized in this bill for 2026 and that, over the 2027–2030 period, the costs associated with those activities would be specifically authorized in future defense authorization acts.

Military End Strength. The bill would affect the force structure of the various military services by setting end-strength levels for 2026. Assuming those authorized end-strength levels continue after 2026, those changes would affect spending in future years.

For 2026, title IV would authorize end-strength levels for active-duty personnel and personnel in the selected reserve of 1,302,800 and 773,400, respectively. Of those reservists, 91,554 would serve full time on active duty in support of the reserves. In total, when compared with levels authorized under current law for 2025, active-duty end strength would increase by 26,100, and the selected-reserve end strength would increase by 100. The number of selected reservists who would serve in full-time support positions would decrease by 627. The specified end-strength levels for each component of the armed forces are detailed below along with CBO’s estimate of how those changes would affect costs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Those costs for personnel include components of military compensation such as basic pay, allowances, bonuses, and health care, as well as operating costs for training and maintenance.

Active Duty. Section 401 would increase the authorized number of active-duty personnel by 26,100. End strength would increase by 12,300 for the Navy, by 11,700 for the Army, by 1,500 for the Air Force, and by 600 for the Space Force. The end strength authorized for the Marine Corps would remain the same. CBO estimates that the increase in active-duty personnel would increase costs to DoD by $22.5 billion over the 2026-2030 period.

Selected Reserve. Under section 411, the authorized end strengths for the six reserve components in DoD would decrease by a net of 1,400. Authorized end strength would decrease by 3,800 for the Army Reserve, by 2,000 for the Air National Guard, and by 200 for the Navy Reserve. End strength would increase for the Army National Guard by 3,000, for the Marine Corps Reserve by 1,100, and by 500 for the Air Force Reserve. CBO estimates that the net decrease would reduce DoD’s costs by $0.4 billion over the 2026‑2030 period.

In addition, section 411 would raise the authorized end strength for the Coast Guard Reserve by 1,500. CBO estimates that change would increase DHS’s costs by $0.4 billion over the 2026-2030 period.

Full-Time Selected Reserve. Section 412 would reduce by 627 the number of reservists who serve full time on active duty in support of the reserves in 2026 compared with currently authorized end-strength levels for 2025. That decline in full-time reservists would decrease DoD’s costs by $0.6 billion over the 2026-2030 period, CBO estimates.

Reserve Technicians.Section 413 would decrease the end strength for dual-status military technicians by 1,815. Those personnel are federal civilian employees who are required to maintain membership in the selected reserve as a condition of their employment. CBO estimates that spending on salaries for dual-status positions would decrease by $1.2 billion over the 2026-2030 period. (Changing the number of dual-status technicians would not change the number of reservists set by sections 411 and 412, discussed above. Thus, the only budgetary effects would be the decrease in civilian compensation.)

Defense Compensation and Benefits.H.R 3838 would affect compensation and benefits for uniformed personnel and civilian employees of DoD. That compensation includes bonuses and certain allowances.

Expiring Bonuses and Allowances. Section 611 would extend for one year DoD’s authority to enter into agreements to pay certain bonuses and allowances to military personnel. The authority to enter into such agreements currently expires after December 31, 2025. Some bonuses are paid in lump sums; others are paid in annual or monthly installments over several years of military service. Using information from DoD’s budget request for fiscal year 2026, CBO estimates that extending that authority through December 31, 2026, would cost $13.1 billion over the 2026‑2030 period.

Basic Needs Allowance. Section 621 would require DoD to exclude the basic allowance for housing from the calculation of gross household income used to determine eligibility for and the amount of the basic needs allowance, a monthly payment to service members whose gross incomes are less than 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. The amount of the basic needs allowance is the difference between a service member’s monthly gross income and the monthly income level at 200 percent of poverty guidelines for the location in the United States where the member lives and the size of the member’s household.

On the basis of information from the department about service members’ pay and family sizes, CBO estimates that under current law, DoD will spend roughly $10 million on the basic needs allowance, paying about $300 a month, on average, to 3,000 families whose gross incomes—including the housing allowance—are less than the 200 percent threshold. If the housing allowance were excluded from the calculation of gross income, 52,000 families would receive an average of $760 each month, CBO estimates. Accounting for the time needed to implement the new policy, CBO anticipates that DoD would begin making payments using calculations required by the bill in April 2026 (halfway through the fiscal year). The authority to pay the basic needs allowance expires after December 31, 2027.

Thus, implementing section 621 would increase costs for the basic needs allowance by $230 million in 2026 and $805 million over the 2026-2030 period, CBO estimates.

Military Health System. Title 7 would increase costs paid from discretionary appropriations for the Military Health System by requiring DoD to cover costs associated with assisted reproductive technology (ART), eliminating out-of-pocket costs for reserve members enrolled in the TRICARE dental program, adding requirements to annual health assessments, and increasing reimbursements to children’s hospitals.

Assisted Reproductive Technology. Section 703 would require DoD to provide assisted reproductive technology to active-duty service members, members of the selected reserve, and their dependents as part of the regular TRICARE health benefit, beginning in fiscal year 2028. CBO anticipates that DoD would provide three services under the provision: in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), and gamete retrieval and storage. CBO estimates that implementing section 703 would cost about $1.8 billion over the 2028-2030 period. Those costs include the cost of births that would result from IVF and IUI procedures. Costs would be less in the first year because childbirths will lag the implementation of the policy. The total estimated costs were reduced to account for the approximately $50 million that DoD currently spends each year on limited ART services offered to TRICARE beneficiaries as part of its medical training programs. The total estimated cost includes the following components:

CBO estimates that IVF procedures would cost about $300 million per year. To estimate the cost of covering IVF, CBO used data from Massachusetts, which requires private health insurance to cover those procedures, to project usage rates for the approximately 900,000 married service members and unmarried female members.Based on that information and on pricing made publicly available by various private clinics, CBO estimates that DoD would cover about 25,000 IVF cycles per year at a cost of $12,000 per cycle.

CBO estimates that IUI services would cost about $30 million per year. Using publicly available data from various private clinics and literature on IUI prevalence, CBO estimates that DoD would cover about 50,000 IUI procedures per year at an average price of $600 per procedure. Because ART is generally not covered by health insurance, the less expensive and less invasive intrauterine insemination procedures are a more common option; thus, IUI procedures are four times more common than IVF. However, if both IUI and IVF were made available with low out-of-pocket costs, CBO expects that TRICARE beneficiaries would instead use IUI at twice the rate of IVF as the general population. The estimate also includes the likelihood that some people will undergo IUI before attempting IVF.

CBO estimates that additional childbirths associated with covering ART would cost about $250 million per year. Based on a literature review, information from DoD, and data from Massachusetts compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CBO estimates that about a third of IVF cycles and about a tenth of IUI cycles would result in a successful childbirth, or about 15,000 births per year. However, CBO assumes that half of those births will occur under current law, either because beneficiaries will pay for ART services themselves or will eventually have a child without ART. Because pregnancies involving IVF and IUI have a higher probability of preterm deliveries and multiple births, CBO estimates that the average cost of each birth would be about $30,000—roughly double the cost of a typical childbirth.

CBO estimates that gamete retrieval and storage would cost about $70 million per year. Under the proposal, DoD may cover gamete retrieval and storage, even in the absence of conditions that cause infertility, for TRICARE beneficiaries who wish to delay or preserve their ability to start a family because of the demands and hazards of military service. There is significant uncertainty about whether DoD would extend that benefit and how many people would use it. Using information on gamete preservation in cancer patients, with adjustments to account for the likelihood that TRICARE beneficiaries would probably use the service at a much lower rate, CBO estimates that about 10,000 men and 3,000 women would undergo gamete retrieval each year. Using publicly available information on pricing for those procedures, CBO estimates that services for men would cost about $500 for retrieval and $125 annually for storage; the cost for women would be about $15,000 for retrieval (multiple cycles are often needed) and about $500 annually for storage.

The estimated costs associated with section 703 are subject to considerable uncertainty. It is difficult to anticipate the rules DoD would set for the use of ART services, and to predict the number of beneficiaries that would ultimately use those services. As a result, the costs of section 703 could be significantly more or less than CBO estimated.

Dental Benefits for Selected Reserve.Section 701 would eliminate all out-of-pocket costs for members of the selected reserve who choose to participate in the TRICARE dental program. CBO estimates that implementing that section would cost about $1.2 billion over the 2026‑2030 period. Under current law, reserve members who participate in the dental program must pay a portion of the insurance premium, as well as any copayments or coinsurance. Based on take-up rates for other reserve health benefits and national statistics on dental care, CBO estimates those changes would increase participation in the TRICARE dental program from less than 100,000 currently to about 425,000 members, and that each enrollee would cost DoD about $600 per year. (Currently, DoD’s share of dental costs average about $225 per enrolled member.)

Health Assessments. Section 702 would require a sports physical, electrocardiogram, metabolic panel, thyroid test, and brain peptide test as part of the annual health assessment for service members. That health assessment currently consists of a detailed questionnaire; additional testing is performed only when deemed necessary by the reviewing physician. CBO estimates that adding those new requirements would increase costs to DoD by about $1.0 billion over the 2026-2030 period. CBO estimates that implementing this section would increase the cost of each assessment by about $120, on average, the maximum allowable charges under TRICARE for those additional tests and exams. Based on the current number of service members, CBO estimates that about two million periodic health assessments are performed each year.

Payments to Children’s Hospitals. Section 723 would increase by 30 percent the reimbursements for outpatient services to children’s hospitals that serve many dependents of active-duty service members. Based on hospital reimbursement data from DoD, CBO estimates that seven hospitals per year would qualify for the additional payments, and that those hospitals currently receive about $175 million per year in outpatient reimbursements. Higher payments would be made the year following an eligibility determination, which CBO anticipates would occur in 2026. Therefore, increasing those reimbursements by 30 percent would cost about $50 million per year beginning in 2027 and total $200 billion through 2030.

Multiyear Procurement and Block Buy Contracts. H.R. 3838 would authorize DoD to enter into multiyear procurement contracts and block buy contracts to purchase certain helicopters and ships. Multiyear procurement is a special contracting method that permits the government to enter into contracts covering acquisitions for more than one year, even though the total funds required for all years are not appropriated at the time the contracts are awarded. Contracts that would cost more than $500 million must be specifically authorized in both an authorization act and an appropriation act. Lawmakers sometimes authorize contracts that would cost less than that threshold. Block buy contracts are also used to procure items over a period of more than one year, but are not subject to the same statutory restrictions as multiyear procurement contracts and do not require authorization in an appropriation act.

Black Hawk Helicopters. Section 111 would authorize the Army to enter multiyear contracts beginning in fiscal year 2027 to procure UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The UH-60 is a medium‑lift helicopter that is used to transport military personnel and supplies. CBO estimates that under such contracts the service would procure 96 aircraft over the 2027‑2030 period at a cost of $3.3 billion. If the Army enters into a multiyear contract for 2027‑2031, then the service would require additional appropriations after 2030 to fulfill its contract obligations.

Aircraft Carriers.Section 121 would authorize the Navy to enter block buy contracts for not more than two Ford-class aircraft carriers: CVN-82 and CVN-83. Carriers are the largest ships in the fleet, and each carries an air wing of about 60 aircraft. CBO estimates that under such contracts, the Navy would buy one carrier at a cost of $8.9 billion over the 2026-2030 period. Additional funding would be required to complete the contract after 2030. The Navy estimates that CVN‑81, the most recently ordered carrier, will cost $15.2 billion by the time of its expected delivery date in 2032. The Ford-class program experienced schedule delays and cost growth in recent years. CBO expects that the cost of each aircraft carrier procured under the contracts authorized by section 121 would be similar to or slightly greater than CVN‑81.

Columbia-Class Submarines.Section 122 would authorize the Navy to enter a block buy contract beginning in fiscal year 2026 for not more than five Columbia-class submarines. Strategic ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), which carry Trident ballistic missiles, are one component of the United States’ nuclear triad. CBO estimates that under such a contract, the Navy would order one submarine per year at a cost of $40.3 billion over the 2026-2030 period. Additional funding would be required to complete the contract after 2030. The Navy estimates that SSBN-827, which was ordered in 2024, will cost $10.7 billion in total. The program experienced schedule delays and cost growth in recent years. CBO expects that the unit costs of the five submarines procured under the authority in section 122 would be similar to the most recently ordered submarine.

Barges.Section 125 would authorize the Navy to enter multiyear contracts beginning in fiscal year 2026 to procure Yard, Repair, Berthing, and Messing barges, which are vessels that provide temporary berthing and dining facilities for sailors when the ships to which they are assigned undergo maintenance. CBO expects that under such contracts, the Navy would buy five vessels over the 2026‑2030 period at a total cost of $180 million.

Construction Contracts. Section 2807 would authorize the DoD to enter into multiyear procurement contracts in fiscal year 2026 for the construction of military unaccompanied housing and child development centers. The authority would be limited to projects that use standardized and repeatable designs, demonstrate cost savings relative to single-year contracts, and are included in the current future years defense program. Based on DoD’s plans and the cost of similar facilities, CBO estimates the department would enter into contracts for 10 facilities in 2026 at a cost of $750 million over the 2026-2030 period.

Direct Spending and Revenues

Several provisions in H.R. 3838, described below, would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO estimates the effects of those provisions would not be significant over the 2026-2035 period because they would affect very few people, would have offsetting effects, or would involve transactions of very small amounts.

Section 512 would authorize the Marine Corps to activate certain Selected Reserve personnel for up to 545 days, an increase of 180 days from the limit in current law. Some of those Reservists could begin receiving retired pay earlier as a result.

Sections 211, 515, 818, 820, 856, 871, 876, 904, 1103, 1104, 1233, 1234, 1301, 1603, 1615, and 1842 would allow agencies to accept and spend, without further appropriation, amounts received from nonfederal entities for various purposes. Those collections are classified as offsetting receipts (or reductions in direct spending). Because CBO does not expect those agencies to spend all the funds they receive, the net effect of those sections would be an insignificant reduction in direct spending.

Sections 331 and 333 would affect DoD’s authority to use working capital funds for capital investment and minor construction projects at military depots. Through working capital funds, DoD is authorized to incur obligations in advance of appropriations. That type of authority, called contract authority, is classified as direct spending. Based on information from DoD about the current use of such contract authority, CBO estimates that the increase in direct spending from those provisions would be insignificant.

Section 534 would require the Selective Service System to automatically register for the military draft every male U.S. citizen and permanent resident between the ages of 18 and 26. Failure to register under current law constitutes grounds for civil and criminal penalties and can delay the ability of some lawful permanent residents to naturalize—that is, to become American citizens—which in turn can delay the receipt of some federal benefits. Because lawful permanent residents would be registered automatically under section 534, their ability to naturalize would not be delayed for failure to register. CBO expects any resulting increase in direct spending for federal benefits and reductions in revenues from penalties would be insignificant.

Sections 591 and 592 would authorize awards of the Medal of Honor that will not occur under current law. Recipients who are living receive monthly pensions that are paid from mandatory appropriations, and surviving spouses of deceased recipients could receive expanded health benefits or increased survivor benefits.

Section 651 would allow more people to use commissary stores on military bases. Newly eligible patrons using credit or debit cards would be required to pay a fee to offset the card transaction costs paid by the Department of the Treasury from mandatory appropriations.

Sections 705, 706, 707, 746, and 747 would change the cost of providing health benefits to service members, military retirees, and their dependents. Health benefits for military retirees who are eligible for Medicare or who are from the other uniformed services (the Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Public Health Service) are paid from mandatory appropriations.

Section 804 would authorize DoD to indemnify contractors for the loss of work in process if they are unable to obtain insurance for such losses because of the classified nature of the contracts. If indemnification claims exceed available appropriations, any additional payments would be made from the Judgment Fund.

Sections 552, 553, 831, 855, 1205, and 1722 affect the number of people who would be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including fines, for prohibited conduct. Such penalties are recorded as revenues, and some of those penalties can be spent without further appropriation.

Section 1047 would authorize DoD to transfer ownership of five T-37B aircraft to the Arizona Aviation Historical Group. Some of those aircraft, or parts thereof, could be sold as excess defense articles under current law.

Section 1081 would expand DoD’s authority to seize unmanned aircraft that threaten military facilities. Proceeds from the sale of such assets are recorded as revenues, deposited into the Assets Forfeiture Fund, and later spent without further appropriation.

Section 1211 would extend through December 31, 2028, the President’s authority to transfer obsolete or surplus defense articles in the War Reserve Stockpile for Allies to Israel. Those transfers could affect the Foreign Military Sales program. The Foreign Military Sales trust fund can receive and expend amounts without further appropriation.

Section 1514 would revise federal acquisition regulations, which could affect direct spending by some federal agencies that are allowed to use fees, receipts from the sale of goods, and other collections to cover operating costs.

Section 2842 would authorize the Government Services Administration to convey 435 acres at the former Curtis Bay Depot in Maryland to a state development corporation. CBO anticipates that the sales price would likely be reduced to account for expected cleanup costs that would otherwise have been borne by the government.

Section 3532 would increase outlays from currently available balances for grant programs at the Department of Transportation. Changes in outlays from appropriations that are available under current law are classified as direct spending. CBO anticipates that any increase in the costs of such grants would be insignificant.

Uncertainty

Most estimates for this bill are affected by some level of uncertainty, but several provisions in particular are difficult to estimate.

The costs associated with providing assisted reproductive technology under section 703 could be significantly more or less than CBO estimated. The costs would depend on the number of people who use the services and the prices that DoD pays.

The costs associated with multiyear procurement and block buy contracts under sections 111, 121, 122, 125, and 2807 could be significantly more or less than CBO estimated. The total cost of such contracts would depend on unit costs, quantity, and procurement schedules. In addition, the department has not estimated any potential savings that could be realized from using those contracts for the specified programs, and CBO did not include an assumption of savings in its estimate.

Pay-As-You-Go Considerations

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would change direct spending and revenues by between -$500,000 and $500,000 over the 2025-2035 period.

Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits

CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3838 would not significantly increase net direct spending in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.

CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3838 would not significantly increase on‑budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.

Mandates

H.R. 3838 would impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the total cost of those mandates would not exceed the thresholds established in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($103 million and $206 million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).

Mandate that Applies to Intergovernmental and Private Entities

Title IV would increase the costs of complying with existing intergovernmental and private-sector mandates under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by increasing the number of active-duty service members relative to current law. The SCRA requires public and private entities to grant service members and some reservists while on active duty with various protections for business and tax transactions, consumer contracts, and court procedures.

The SCRA, for example, allows service members to maintain a single state of residence for paying state and local personal income taxes and to request deferrals for certain state and local fees. It also requires creditors to charge no more than 6 percent interest on a service member’s loan obligations if the loan originated before the service member began active duty, and it allows courts to temporarily stay certain civil proceedings, such as evictions, foreclosures, and repossessions. SCRA prohibits lenders from using a service member’s personal assets to satisfy a trade or business liability during a period of military service. It also allows service members to terminate residential and auto leases and some consumer contracts under certain conditions.

Under the bill, the number of active-duty service members covered by SCRA would increase by 26,100, about 2 percent more than current authorization levels. The cost of the mandate would depend on various factors like how many service members use the SCRA, the frequency and duration of their deployment, and the market rates for car loans and mortgages. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of compliance for public and private entities would result in several millions of dollars in lost revenue each year.

Mandate for Intergovernmental Entities

Section 708 would establish a pilot program to offer enrollees of TRICARE supplemental insurance coverage for otherwise non-covered expenses. Coverage would be sold by not more than two insurance companies, and for the coverage offered, the programmatic requirements of the pilot program would supersede state laws on the licensing of insurance companies and solvency requirements, a preemption of state laws. The bill would require companies participating in the program to be licensed in every state. CBO estimates that the preemption of state laws would not result in an increase in expenditures or losses in revenue.

The company also provided updates on its clinical programs and corporate developments.

Financial Highlights

For the second quarter of 2025, BiomX reported a net loss of $6.0 million, compared to an income of $4.5 million in the same period of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the fair value of warrants issued as part of the company’s March 2024 financing. Research and development expenses were $5.0 million, down from $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, driven by reduced salary expenses, lower rent expenses, and increased grant funding. General and administrative expenses also decreased to $2.4 million from $2.8 million in the same period last year.

Business and Operational Highlights

BiomX achieved significant milestones in its clinical programs. The Phase 2 trial of BX211 for diabetic foot osteomyelitis showed a >40% reduction in wound size compared to placebo, with planning underway for a potential registrational study. Additionally, the Phase 2b trial of BX004 in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) commenced patient dosing, with topline results expected in Q1 2026. New data published in Nature Communications highlighted a ~500-fold bacterial reduction with BX004 versus placebo, with no detectable emergence of resistance.

Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments

BiomX is planning a potential registrational study for BX211, pending feedback from the FDA. The company is also in discussions with the U.S. Defense Health Agency regarding the next steps for the BX211 program. Additionally, BiomX expects to receive FDA feedback on the use of real-world evidence for BX004 in the second half of 2025, which could streamline the approval pathway.

Management's Perspective

Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX, commented on the company's progress, stating, ""Positive Phase 2 results for BX211 in diabetic foot osteomyelitis demonstrated sustained, statistically significant improvements in wound size reduction, with over 40% reduction in ulcer size compared to placebo, and a favorable safety profile. In parallel, new peer-reviewed data for BX004 reported approximately 500-fold further bacterial reduction versus placebo and no detectable emergence of resistance, critical evidence supports the strength of our candidate BX004.""

Future Outlook

BiomX is positioned for multiple value-driving catalysts over the next 12 months, with the Phase 2b trial of BX004 underway and FDA feedback on the real-world evidence plan expected later this year. The company also plans to report topline results from the Phase 2b study in Q1 2026.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-13 11:56:42.204628

SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Advanced Surgical Retractor Systems, Inc. (ASR Systems) announced today that its flagship product, the TITAN CSR® retractor, was identified as the top-performing retractor system in a Department of Defense–funded study evaluating surgical retraction platforms for forward-deployed surgical teams.

The findings were presented at the Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS) 2025, the DoD's premier scientific meeting on military medicine. The study, ""Comparison of Self-Retaining Retractor Systems for Use in Forward-Deployed Surgical Teams,"" evaluated multiple commercially available systems — including the TITAN CSR® retractor, Bookwalter®, Alexis™, and Balfour — based on exposure quality, ease of use, portability, and suitability for damage control surgery in austere environments.

Statistically significant results from the study demonstrated that the TITAN CSR® retractor:

Provided the greatest surgical exposure of any retractor tested, measured by the visualized surface area of the abdominal cavity. Surgeons rated the TITAN CSR® retractor's exposure performance 4.9 out of 5.0 — nearly a perfect score and a critical advantage for life-saving operations where every centimeter of visibility matters.

Assembled and deployed faster than the Bookwalter®, a complex system requiring a table attachment and multiple components. Combat hospitals often lack the standard operating room beds with side rails needed to mount the Bookwalter®, meaning it is frequently not even an option for military surgeons. The TITAN CSR® retractor eliminates this limitation, and in high-acuity trauma cases, reducing setup time can help achieve control of hemorrhage faster and save valuable minutes in the operating room.

Received the highest overall perception of use among all systems tested, based on surgeon and surgical team ratings of setup simplicity, adaptability to different procedures, stability during use, and overall effectiveness in achieving optimal exposure.

The study was led by Dr. Mylea Echazarreta Cristner, who received the Young Investigator Award at MHSRS 2025 for this work.

""The TITAN CSR® retractor has been rigorously evaluated by the Department of Defense, with the study's significant findings showing it delivers the greatest surgical exposure, fastest setup, and highest overall surgeon satisfaction among systems tested,"" said Dr. Ramon Cestero, trauma surgeon, military veteran, and inventor of the TITAN CSR® retractor. ""It is in active use at military facilities as well as Level 1 trauma centers across the U.S. and Canada, where civilian surgeons have reported the same benefits in their own high-acuity cases — speed, exposure, and simplicity that directly impact patient outcomes.""

About the TITAN CSR® Retractor

Designed for austere, damage control, and trauma surgery, the TITAN CSR® retractor is a lightweight, post-free, self-retaining retractor that allows rapid setup and exceptional exposure without requiring a surgical table. It is actively used at multiple Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), by special operations surgical teams, and at deployed Role 2 military hospitals around the world, including:

Brooke Army Medical Center

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center

Naval Medical Center San Diego (Balboa)

Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth

Michaud Expeditionary Medical Facility, Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti (CLDJ)

Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) surgical teams

Importantly, the same design and performance advantages that make the TITAN CSR® retractor ideal for military use translate directly to civilian trauma centers and operating rooms. Many of the most significant advancements in civilian trauma surgery — from tourniquets to damage control laparotomy — originated in the military before becoming standard of care in civilian practice. The TITAN CSR® retractor follows that tradition, providing rapid setup, superior exposure, and unmatched versatility for multiple surgical specialties performing abdominal surgery in hospitals worldwide.

Key Features of the TITAN CSR® Retractor:

Post-Free™ Design – No table attachment required

Rapid Setup – Assembles in under 2 minutes

Portability – Compact and rugged for field or hospital use

Versatility – Used in trauma, general, and multiple other surgical specialties performing abdominal surgery

Reusable – Fully autoclavable, reducing long-term costs

However, this perspective overlooks critical issues with PBM practices and the broader implications for Louisianans, especially veterans.

Maness’ claim that banning PBM-owned pharmacies would harm veterans and rural residents is misleading. In truth, PBMs often exploit these populations by funneling them into mail-order systems that lack transparency and accountability. TRICARE, the federally funded health plan for service members and veterans, contracts with a Fortune 15 corporation whose PBM pushes beneficiaries to fill their prescriptions through its privately contracted PBM mail-order pharmacy. Veterans and service members may use the military base pharmacy, but there are only three military bases in the state.

Under the TRICARE PBM’s plan, basic generic medications like Atorvastatin, which costs an average of $8.47 for a 90-day supply without insurance, costs more than $500 through TRICARE’s PBM-owned mail-order pharmacy. In addition, TRICARE’s PBM offers Louisiana independent pharmacies contracts with reimbursements so unsustainably low that very few local pharmacies can afford to join the TRICARE network. How does lack of access to a local pharmacy benefit veterans and rural residents?

Big box and national chain pharmacies rarely set up shop in rural areas, and patients cannot have a relationship with a mail-order pharmacy or its call center.

When a family member passes away, it can feel overwhelming to deal with paperwork on top of the emotional burden. This article provides a few steps you should take in the weeks following your family member’s death. Taking these steps can help ensure your coverage continues without interruption.

“After losing a family member, your health coverage may not be the first thing on your mind,” said Zelly Zim, senior analyst, TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “But it’s important to understand how your loved one’s death may affect your TRICARE coverage, so you’re prepared for your family’s future.”

A death in the family is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. This means that surviving family members have 90 days to make eligible health plan changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet. Here’s what else you need to know.

Reporting the death

If your sponsor dies

You only have to report the death to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. For medical and dental care, the Defense Manpower Data Center gets information from the Social Security Administration or the sponsor’s service.

It may take some time for DMDC to get the information. If you prefer, you may notify DMDC of the death by:

Visiting a local Uniformed Services ID card office with a copy of the death certificate

Faxing a copy of the death certificate to 800-336-4416

Mailing a copy of the death certificate to:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

If your sponsor was retired, there are other steps you need to take depending on their service.

If another family member dies

If a family member who wasn’t the sponsor dies, contact the DMDC/DEERS Support Office to learn the necessary steps to report their death. Depending on your situation, your health plan options may also change from family to individual.

Coverage following the death

TRICARE continues to provide coverage for surviving family members. Plans and costs depend on:

If you're a spouse or a child:

Spouses can keep TRICARE unless they remarry. If a spouse decides to remarry, their TRICARE coverage will end unless they marry another active duty or retired service member.

Children can keep TRICARE up to normal age limits. After that, if they qualify for TRICARE Young Adult, they can purchase TYA coverage if their sponsor had TRICARE at the time of their death.

The sponsor's military status when they died:

Active duty: Children and spouses are considered transitional survivors for the first three years after the sponsor dies. Transitional survivors are eligible for special programs like the Extended Care Health Option. Spouses are covered as active duty family members (unless they remarry) for these three years. Then, they’re covered as retired family members. Children remain covered as ADFMs until they age out or lose TRICARE eligibility for other reasons.

Retired: Your health plan options and costs won’t change. Surviving spouses remain eligible unless they remarry. Children remain covered until they age out or lose eligibility for other reasons.

National Guard or Reserve member: Your sponsor’s status at the time of their death determines your TRICARE benefits. Visit Survivors of National Guard and Reserve Members to read more about your specific situation. (Note: Beginning Oct. 1, 2025, you can buy or continue coverage for up to three years from the date of the sponsor’s death. This is if your sponsor had TRICARE coverage at the time of their death.)

Filing claims

If you need to file a claim on behalf of the deceased, check out Filing Claims for forms and instructions.

For TRICARE For Life beneficiaries, you need to submit the TRICARE For Life Executor/Executrix of Estate Notification with the claim.

For beneficiaries with all other plans, submit an Authorization for Disclosure of Medical or Dental Information (DD Form 2870) with the claim.

To learn more

If you have questions about this process, call the DMDC/DEERS Support Office at 800-538-9552 (TTY/TDD: 866-363-2883).
