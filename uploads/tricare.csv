How it works is he’ll get the disability payout from which ever is going to pay more with the added bonus of getting the retirement benefits if he is rated 30% by DoD.

For military spouses, caregivers, and families, now is a crucial time to take action. If you don’t update your benefits, your family could face service interruptions, higher costs, or unexpected coverage gaps next year.

In 2025, TRICARE regions and contractors underwent changes. Referral waivers were discontinued, and premiums for young adults increased. In 2026, potential Prime program pilots and eligibility changes may further impact dependent coverage. Here’s what’s changed and what to do now.

What Changed in 2025

Region and Contractor Reassignments

On January 1, 2025, TRICARE’s new managed care contracts (called T-5) took effect across the continental U.S. The administrative functions: enrollment, network maintenance, and claims processing moved to new regional contractors.

Humana Military retained the East Region. TriWest Healthcare Alliance replaced Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) as the West Region contractor.

Six states—Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin—were reassigned from East to West. Those dependents are now under TriWest’s jurisdiction.

TriWest will accept unexpired referrals and authorizations issued by the previous contractor prior to January 1, 2025. These will remain valid until their expiration or September 30, 2025, whichever is earlier. This applies to both general referrals and those under the Autism Care Demonstration (ACD).

Referral Waiver Expiration and New Rules

The Defense Health Agency extended the referral approval waiver for TRICARE Prime dependents in the West Region through June 30, 2025. Under that waiver, specialty care referrals did not require prior approval by TriWest.

Starting July 1, 2025, standard referral and authorization procedures resume. TriWest will require referrals and approvals in accordance with standard rules for outpatient services, equipment orders, and other services.

If a provider is non-network and is not named on a referral, point-of-service fees will apply beginning October 1, 2025. That means if you continue to see a specialist who was in the network but is no longer, and your referral is not updated, you may incur extra costs. For example, families could face an additional $50 per visit for a general consultation or up to $200 for specialty care services in point-of-service fees.

Cost Changes and Young Adult Premiums

TRICARE released its 2025 Costs & Fees sheet. TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) premiums for 2025 are: $727/month for TYA Prime and $337/month for TYA Select.

These increases are significant, and many military families are calling for reform. Advocacy groups note that TYA costs have increased significantly over the past decade.

Legislation proposed in 2025—the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act”—would allow eligible dependents to remain on TRICARE until age 26 without separate TYA premiums. The bill has not passed yet.

TRICARE Open Season 2025 is scheduled to take place from November 10 to December 9. During that time, beneficiaries can change enrollment plans or make other updates for coverage that begins in 2026. The FEDVIP dental/vision window runs from November 10 through December 8.

Families in transition states were required to update their method of payment (direct debit, credit/debit card) with TriWest by December 31, 2024, to ensure uninterrupted billing continuity.

In 2025, many families in the realigned states faced confusion, delays in claims, and questions about ongoing care with the new contractors. Some issues have been resolved, but it’s still essential to remain vigilant.

What to Expect in 2026

TRICARE Prime Pilot Programs

In 2026, TRICARE will pilot a new Prime model in Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, under CareSource Military & Veterans. The pilot aims to test expanded access and simplified care for dependents and retirees in those metro areas.

In the pilot:

• Referrals may not be required for in-network care

• Enrollment fees waived in Year 1

• Enrollment limited to those metro zones

• Out-of-network access will be restricted

If successful, this pilot could influence broader changes to the Prime program in later years.

Possible Expansion of Dependent Age

If the proposed legislation passes, dependents could stay on TRICARE until age 26 without needing to purchase TYA. That change would relieve many families facing high premiums and narrow transitions. Watch for congressional votes or committee movement in late 2025 or early 2026.

Continued Network and Provider Transitions

Providers must renegotiate or reapply for their participation under the new TRICARE contracts. Some may not rejoin or may change terms, forcing families to find new providers—especially in specialties such as behavioral health and therapy.

The first full year under the new structure will likely reveal emergent issues in referrals, provider directories, and claim routing, particularly in states that have transitioned.

What Spouses Should Do Now

Confirm your region and contractor by using TRICARE’s region lookup tool. That determines who processes your claims and authorizations.

Update your DEERS record immediately. Verify address, marital status, dependent child status, and student status. Errors here lead to denied claims or lost eligibility.

Review active referrals and authorizations. Replace any that expire after September 30, 2025, particularly if your provider is shifting networks.

Contact your specialist or therapy provider to confirm they are in the new network. If they are not, request a new referral to an in-network provider before appointments.

Mark Open Season dates: November 10–December 9 for TRICARE; November 10–December 8 for FEDVIP. Use that time to compare plan options (Prime vs. Select) for 2026.

Monitor advocacy and legislation updates. If age-26 coverage becomes law, it could alter your planning significantly.

What It All Means for Military Families

The 2025 TRICARE dependent reforms are among the system’s most significant shifts, involving changes to contractors, resets of referral policies, increased costs, and new coverage boundaries.

In 2026, changes will continue. New Prime pilots, possible age-26 coverage, and ongoing network shifts make it crucial for families to stay informed about their options.

To stay protected, take action now: confirm your contractor, update your DEERS record, verify all referrals, and prepare for Open Season. Proactive steps keep your family covered.

Stay vigilant, plan now, and your family will be ready for the next round of TRICARE changes.

As a healthcare provider who works with military families and Tricare patients, I understand how crucial it is to find the right Tricare-accepted doctor near you—someone who not only accepts your insurance but also provides quality, compassionate care.

Let’s walk through everything you need to know about finding the best Tricare doctors near Fort Meade, the process of using Tricare’s doctor search tool, and what to look for in a healthcare provider.

What Is Tricare and Who Can Use It?

Tricare is the health care program for active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. It provides comprehensive medical coverage across several plan options, including:

Tricare Prime (managed care option)

Tricare Select (preferred provider option)

Tricare For Life (for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries)

Tricare Reserve Select (for reservists and families)

Each plan type determines how you can access care and which doctors you can visit. For those living or working in Fort Meade, it’s important to choose a provider who’s in-network and familiar with military family healthcare needs.

How to Find Tricare Doctors Near Fort Meade

Finding a Tricare-approved doctor doesn’t have to be difficult. Here are three reliable ways to locate doctors who accept Tricare near you:

1. Use the Tricare Doctor Finder Tool

Start with the official Tricare Doctor Finder. This online search allows you to locate Tricare-accepted doctors based on your plan, specialty, and location.

To use it:

Go to tricare.mil/finddoctor

Choose your region (East or West)

Select your plan type (Prime, Select, etc.)

Enter your ZIP code or city (Fort Meade, MD 20755)

You’ll get a list of Tricare doctors near you, complete with addresses, contact details, and specialties.

Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (KACC) – the on-base medical facility for Fort Meade.

First Lady Medical Center – an independent clinic accepting Tricare patients for family medicine, women’s health, and preventive care.

Local primary care clinics in Odenton, Laurel, and Hanover – many of which are within 10–15 minutes of Fort Meade and welcome Tricare members.

If you’re searching online, try entering terms like:

“Doctors that accept Tricare near me”

“Tricare doctors near Fort Meade”

“Find a Tricare doctor in Maryland”

These queries often pull up verified local providers, clinics, and urgent care centers that participate in the Tricare network.

What to Look for in a Tricare Doctor

When choosing a Tricare-accepted doctor, consider more than just proximity. Look for:

Experience with Tricare patients – Military families often have unique needs related to deployment stress, frequent relocations, and specific health conditions.

Comprehensive care – Providers who offer primary care, preventive health, and chronic disease management under one roof.

Ease of access – Online booking, short wait times, and accessible locations near Fort Meade or Odenton.

Network verification – Always confirm that the provider is still accepting Tricare at the time of scheduling.

Primary Care Services Covered by Tricare

Tricare covers a wide range of services when provided by approved doctors or clinics:

Routine physicals & wellness visits

Preventive screenings (blood pressure, cholesterol, cancer checks)

Women’s health (Pap smears, birth control, IUD services)

Chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension, asthma)

Behavioral health services

Vaccinations and immunizations

If you’re using Tricare Prime, you’ll usually need to select a Primary Care Manager (PCM)—often located at Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center or another approved facility near you.

What to Do if You Can’t Find a Tricare Doctor

If the Tricare doctor search doesn’t show nearby options, don’t panic. Here’s what you can do:

Expand your search radius (try Odenton, Severn, or Laurel, MD).

Ask for a referral to a nearby civilian provider.

Call Humana Military to verify new doctors joining the network.

Visit urgent care centers that accept Tricare—no referral required for many plans.

Why Tricare Doctors Are in Demand

Fort Meade is home to thousands of active-duty personnel and their families, plus retirees who rely on Tricare for ongoing care. Because of this large community, Tricare-approved providers in and around Fort Meade often book up quickly.

That’s why it’s smart to establish care early—especially if you just moved to the area or are due for your annual checkup.

Final Thoughts

Finding Tricare doctors shouldn’t be stressful. With tools like the Tricare Doctor Finder, support from Humana Military, and local trusted clinics like Medhaven Health, you can get the care you deserve without delays.

Whether you’re looking for primary care, women’s health, or preventive services, make sure your provider is Tricare-approved, conveniently located, and ready to provide high-quality, patient-centered care.",https://medhavenhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tricare-Doctors-Near-Fort-Meade.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-07 19:56:34.223290

These viruses include RSV, pneumonia, and COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “respiratory illnesses affect your lungs and airways, making it hard to breathe.”

According to the CDC, these are symptoms from upper-respiratory viruses:

Runny or stuffy nose

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Cough

Vomiting or diarrhea

Headache

Muscle or body aches

Fever

Chills

Fatigue (tiredness)

Weakness

Decrease in appetite

Executive director of Immunize El Paso, Henry Brutus, told KTSM that after 30 years of operating Immunize El Paso clinics in the Borderland and vaccinating tens of thousands of adults and children, vaccines are safe and effective.

Brutus says his technicians are reaching a group of people who want to be vaccinated but can’t because they have mobility issues that prevent them from leaving their homes. That’s where Immunize El Paso’s Flu2You program comes in.

Immunization technicians will visit those unable to leave their homes and vaccinate them in the comfort of their homes.

• Personal Financial Readiness: The Military and Family Readiness Center personal financial readiness program sustains and improves financial literacy and readiness by offering information, education, training and free personal financial counseling to Airmen, Guardians and their families. The DAF has also increased the number of Personal Financial Managers available to assist and enhance financial readiness and money management skills for members and their families.

The Air Force Aid Society continues to support emergent needs such as basic living expenses (e.g., food, rent/mortgage, utilities), vehicle expenses (e.g., payments, repairs, insurance) and childcare costs. Airmen and Guardians can submit requests through local Military and Family Readiness Centers and Airman and Family Readiness Centers.

If Airmen, Guardians or their families are not near an aid organization, they may seek financial assistance from the Red Cross.

Several banking institutions, such as USAA, Navy Federal Credit Union and Marine Federal Credit Union, have been known to advance military pay to their customers during government shutdowns. Contact your bank to inquire about their policies for situations like these.

• Food Insecurity: First sergeants and Military and Family Readiness Centers assist Airmen, Guardians and their families in need of food security-related grants and loans with referrals to programs such as U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Federal Subsistence Supplemental Allowance program and the Air Force Aid Society.

The FY22 National Defense Authorization Act established a Basic Needs Allowance. The BNA Program provides supplemental income for military members and dependents whose gross household income falls below 200% of federal poverty guidelines.

TRICARE: In response to the ongoing possibility of a government shutdown, the Defense Health Agency has authorized its TRICARE contractors to continue delivering health care to the 9.4 million beneficiaries of TRICARE. TRICARE beneficiaries seeking medical care from private providers should feel no significant effects. Care at military hospitals and clinics would remain largely unaffected. The TRICARE website includes current information about the impact of the shutdown on TRICARE health plans and military hospitals and clinics.

Vance AFB The only information posted on the website of Vance Air Force Base at Enid was this statement: “DUE TO THE LAPSE IN APPROPRIATIONS, THIS PAGE WILL NOT BE UPDATED REGULARLY UNTIL FULL OPERATIONS RESUME.” McAlester Army Ammunition Plant Southwest Ledger placed calls to two telephone numbers listed on the installation’s website; no one answered either call. Also, no information whatsoever was listed on the website about the government shutdown and how it affected the ammunition plant. Tinker AFB The most comprehensive notice of what was and what wasn’t available during the shutdown was posted on the Tinker Air Force Base website.

At Tinker, in the Oklahoma City metro area, Public Affairs for the 72nd Air Base Wing announced that the base “remains committed to sustaining national defense, supporting mission-essential operations, and ensuring the safety and readiness of its service members, civilian workforce, and families.”

Myriad services were not affected by the shutdown.

• Flying operations, depot maintenance, and national defense tasks continued uninterrupted.

• Aircraft launch, recovery, and air traffic control remained active.

• Law enforcement, fire, and emergency response were fully operational.

• Military treatment facilities, including pharmacy services, stayed open. Some routine care was limited, but only because of staffing and priorities.

• Service members continued performing assigned duties, even though their pay was expected to be delayed.

• Child Development Centers remained open, including before and after school care.

• The Commissary and Base Exchange remained open to authorized patrons.

Services affected Non-exempt civilian employees were furloughed; essential or funded roles continued without pay until appropriations resume. Retroactive pay was guaranteed by law.

Contractors under fully funded contracts continued working.

The manpower office, civilian personnel office, Numbered Air Force Human Resources office were limited.

Legal services remained available with limited personnel.

The Inspector General continued operations with limited personnel.

Public Affairs website updates and social media posts were paused. The Team Tinker Photo Studio remained open under reduced manning, including passport photos and official portraits.

The Marketing Office was impacted.

Services at the Military Family Readiness Center and at the Force Development office were limited.

Agency/Office: Defense Health Agency

Location: TRICARE Dental Program Office - Aurora (Colorado)

Title: DEFENSE HEALTH AGENCY DENTAL PROGRAM OFFICE SERVICES

DESCRIPTION: The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is developing the 7th generation of the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP) contracts, as well as a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) contract to provide services to the TDP-7 contract. The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2023, Section 701, requires the Department to offer a multi-carrier, multi-choice dental benefits program for Active-Duty family members, survivors, and qualified Reserve Component members and their families. The current contract, TDP-6, consists of one contract/contractor providing all required dental services and necessary eligibility, enrollment, and other administrative functions. The TDP-7 contract will remove several responsibilities performed under the TDP-6 contract and transfer them to the TPA contract. The TPA contractor will manage the administrative features of the premium sharing plans in TDP-7 including eligibility, enrollment, plan changes, premium payment processes, reconciliation, submission of qualifying life events, and address changes for eligible TRICARE beneficiaries. Dental insurance contractors will continue to: process claims; build and maintain dental provider networks; educate providers on TDP policies, educate beneficiaries and eligibles on TDP coverage; and provide customer service to TDP beneficiaries.

The Industry Forum will be held 4-5 November 2025, 8:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. MST, at the DHA Aurora Office. Please see link below with separate RSVP Instructions for those who wish to attend.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Codes are 524114 for TDP and 524292 for TPA. The Product Serivce Codes (PSCs) are Q503 Medical-Dentistry for TDP and Q201 Medical-Managed Care for TPA.

The intent of the Industry Forum is to accomplish the following:

To gather information from the dental care industry through an open exchange of information to be used by the DHA TRICARE Health Plan Dental Program Office and Program Management Office in support of continuous market research in the development of the TDP-7 and TPA acquisition strategy. DHA desires to identify, to the maximum extent possible, commercial best practices in delivering the TRICARE dental benefit and TPA services.

The Government intends to hold a general forum on 4 November 2025 and intends to meet individually with interested TDP7 or TPA PRIME CONTRACTORS on 4 and 5 November 2025. Each interested prime contractor may bring up to three in person attendees. A virtual option will be available for any additional attendees. Industry is advised that not all members of the Government team may be available for every individual session. Information presented by attendees will be shared within the Government team. Industry should bring at least five copies of any briefings provided.

DISCUSSION: The current TDP contract (TDP-6) will expire on 28 February 2030. The NDAA for FY 2023 requires the DHA to develop and implement improvements to dental contracts requiring DoD to offer a multi-carrier, multichoice dental benefits program for Active-Duty families and qualified Reserve Component members and their families.

CONTRACT PURPOSE: DHA is contemplating awarding TDP-7 contracts to multiple carriers, as well as a TPA contract, utilizing full and open competition to provide the covered benefit, and manage enrollment and eligibility and process encounter data.

TDP-7 CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: The following are anticipated to be the major areas of required services for the TDP-7 contract:

Standardized pricing structures that support affordability, simplify comparisons, and reduce enrollment barriers.

Information exchange with the TPA using a systems architecture flexible enough to support technical, business, and mandatory Federal requirements without inhibiting or limiting functionality or user experience.

Dental insurance claims processing in accordance with contractual obligations and TRICARE Dental Program policies.

Maintain a global dental provider network to meet the needs of TDP beneficiaries, including OCONUS providers.

Education of network providers on claims processing procedures and their own contractual obligations.

Education of TRICARE beneficiaries regarding services, how to enroll through the TPA, and what coverage is available under each plan offered.

Comprehensive range of marketing materials, including brochures, flyers, and digital content effectively communicating program offerings and tailored to the military community.

Maintain a Customer Service/Call Center with a knowledgeable, courteous, and responsive call center staff resulting in highly satisfied beneficiaries.

Execute a methodical and carefully planned transition plan, with a focus on maintaining continuity of care and access to services.

Testing capabilities complying with Government Performance Readiness Validation and Performance Readiness Assessment and Verification requirements during the 12-month transition period.

TPA CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: The following performance-based objectives are to be accomplished in the TPA contract:

Provide a cost effective, centralized TDP benefit eligibility and enrollment system.

Provide customer service support for TDP, including plan changes, submission of qualifying life events, and address changes.

Provide related premium/allotment administration services.

Provide a mechanism to reconcile enrollments, premiums, and allotments completely and accurately at the individual enrollee level with each TDP carrier.

Provide superior customer service/call center services for the convenience of users.

Provide a user friendly and informative website with account information and decision support tools with TDP plans' dental premiums and benefits comparison.

Provide education and outreach to eligible beneficiaries.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): DHA sent out RFIs for both TPA and TDP-7 and this forum will be used to discuss questions in those RFIs, as well as other topics. If industry has questions not in those RFIs, DHA asks they be submitted prior to the forum so the appropriate points of contact are present to answer the questions. It is envisioned participants in the Forum, after discussion with DHA, will submit post-Forum position papers, concepts, and alternative ideas related to Forum topics. All Industry Forum attendees having post-Forum questions or submitting position/concept papers will be given an opportunity to further discuss any questions or submissions with the Government after the Forum.

Comments, questions, position/concept papers, and capabilities should be provided to the Government at the address below. Questions industry would like the DHA to address at the industry forum may be sent to the address below, however, due to time constraints, the Government may be unable to provide individual answers during the open forum.

RESPONSES: Written responses are not required; however, written questions will be accepted up to ten (10) business days prior to the Industry Forum. Any questions submitted, unless of a proprietary nature, may be addressed during the Industry Forum. Questions should be submitted to Kristin Moore, Kristin.m.moore13.civ@health.mil and Chelsea Lavelle, Chelsea.m.lavelle.civ@health.mil.

The team advises healthcare and dental organizations on investigations, audits, and enforcement.

DALLAS, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Dykema announced that four former U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys, including three who served in top leadership roles in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas, have joined the firm to support Dykema's dental services and other medical industry clients.

""Healthcare and dental organizations deserve proactive, seasoned guidance when the government calls. Our team brings deep DOJ experience to help clients navigate with confidence."" — Leigha Simonton, Former U.S. Attorney

These new additions bring over 60 years of government-side expertise to Dykema and create what is believed to be the largest concentration of high-level DOJ experience in Texas and the Southwest.

The team includes:

Leigha Simonton, the former presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed United States Attorney, who led an office of over 100 Assistant U.S. Attorneys with five locations, serving over 8 million North Texas residents from the DFW metroplex to cities including Lubbock and Amarillo. Leigha spent 20 years in the Department of Justice, where she specialized in complex legal issues involving health care and other subject matters, eventually serving as Chief of the Appellate Division before becoming U.S. Attorney.

Scott Hogan, the former First Assistant U.S. Attorney, who was second in command in leading the U.S. Attorney's Office. Before becoming First Assistant, Scott served as Chief of the Civil Division. He spent 18 years in the Department of Justice and specialized in False Claims Act investigations and litigation, led civil healthcare fraud investigations and other investigations into businesses and individuals, and defended the government in employment disputes and other civil litigation. He has extensive experience interacting with government agencies including the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), DOD-OIG Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Tricare, Texas Health and Human Services (Texas HHS), Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), and state attorneys general across the country.

Tiffany Eggers, the former Criminal Chief and National Security/Cybercrime Section Chief, who was third in command in the U.S. Attorney's Office. Tiffany spent 25 years as a prosecutor, 20 of those in the Department of Justice. She has tried nearly 140 jury trials, including 49 federal trials. She is an expert on every aspect of federal criminal investigations and cases and has worked with—and therefore has extensive knowledge of—virtually every federal agency, including the FBI, DEA, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and U.S. Secret Service. She is also a nationally recognized authority on cyber issues including malware, ransomware, and online/email schemes to steal money from individuals and businesses.

Sarah Douglas, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and state prosecutor, who brings a total of 15 years of government-side experience to the team. She handled complex criminal matters in two different sections of the U.S. Attorney's Office—the Economic Crimes & Public Corruption Section and the Major Crimes Section—and worked with several different government agencies. Sarah has tried more than 85 jury trials and has argued nine appeals.

This team complements and expands on Dykema's current services to its dental and other medical industry clients.

They are a one-stop shop for issues related to:

responding to a government subpoena or civil investigative demand;

addressing a whistleblower complaint;

handling False Claims Act/qui tam investigations or litigation;

conducting an internal investigation into a suspected problem;

resolving compliance concerns;

responding to a cyberattack (including ransomware, malware, phishing, hacking, or fraudulent payment instructions);

addressing HIPAA or other data-privacy questions;

navigating Medicaid, Medicare, or other government payment issues;

managing dental or medical board investigations or proceedings; and

responding to DOJ, state attorney general, or other federal or state investigations, or related civil/criminal matters involving a governmental entity.

This is the first team of its kind integrated within a leading dental services practice. Together, Dykema's attorneys offer unmatched expertise to serve the needs of dental and other medical industry clients in areas involving corporate transactions, general litigation, compliance, whistleblower, cyber/data privacy, criminal investigations or cases, or any other government-related issues.

I already have my 20 good years letter.
I understand that if I get rated 30% or more of DoD or DoW whatever it is now, I will get the Tricare for Life/Prime.
I really like Tricare Reserve Select so I assume Tricare for Life is similar.
Will they open up my VA claims again and I have to go through that hassle, or they will omit VA since I'm already VA rated and they will just do the DoD rating?","Hello,

Here is my situation.

20+ years in the Guard with several deployments. I'm already rated at VA 100% P&T. I currently use Tricare Reserve Select for myself and my family. I already have my 20 good years letter. Can experts please tell me what happens if I select to be medboarded out? I understand that if I get rated 30% or more of DoD or DoW whatever it is now, I will get the Tricare for Life/Prime.

Is this Tricare only for my or my spouse/family too? If not, can I pay a difference to get them on this plan? I really like Tricare Reserve Select so I assume Tricare for Life is similar.

If I'm on Tricare for Life after retirement, can I put my family on CHAMPVA?

When I go to the annual PHA (physical health assessment), and I tell them about my conditions they will have no choice but to flag me. That will probably result in medboard actions.

What happens next? Will they open up my VA claims again and I have to go through that hassle, or they will omit VA since I'm already VA rated and they will just do the DoD rating?

What happens if for some reason they rate me lower than 30%?

I already did some research and have a good general understanding of how this process works, but please share it with me anyways so I don't miss anything. Thank you for your responses.",,N,0.0,2025-10-06 19:56:31.523212
