The move of the Defense Health Agency from Falls Church, Virginia, could bring as many 3,300 jobs to San Antonio, according to the daily. However, it’s still unclear which parts of the mission may relocate and how many people ultimately might relocate.

The Express-News based its reporting on a letter from members of the city’s congressional delegation to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth along with “recent moves at City Hall.”

The city’s attempts to woo the Defense Health Agency comes as Hegseth has begun pulling two military commands out of San Antonio, including some 1,100 staffers, the Express-News reports. Air Force plans to beef up the cybersecurity operation at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland also appear to have stalled out under the current defense chief.

Both the city and county are ponying up cash to win the Defense Health Agency, the Express-News reports. Each has budgeted $10 million to modernize an existing structure at Fort Sam Houston to house the unit, and each has also requested an additional $5 million in state grants to cover the costs.

Blaine McGraw, according to a release obtained by 25 News.

The Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight law firm says it filed these new complaints against the Department of Defense, U.S. Army, and Defense Health Agency on behalf of seven Jane Does.

Christine Dunn talks on McGraw complaints filed

The complaint says these women are victims of McGraw who were sexually abused or non-consensually videotaped by McGraw during appointments at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) in Fort Hood and the Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii.

Six of the Jane Does in the complaint were treated at the CRDAMC and one was treated during McGraw's time at Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii.

In the release, the administrative complaints filed on Monday allege that the Army is liable for McGraw's actions under the FTCA because, ""it was negligent in hiring, supervising, and retianing McGraw. They also allege that the Army lacked adequate protocols to keep patients safe from sexual abuse.""

The complaints allege McGraw sexually violated the women by video recording them without consent and performing unnecessary medical exams that involved groping their genitals or breasts.

The alleged abuse occurred while the women were in vulnerable states, including while pregnant, after giving birth or in the ICU.

The complaints also claim McGraw frequently ignored standard medical guidelines, such as conducting exams without a medical chaperone present and refusing to allow patients to undress for exams in privacy.

""My clients went to this doctor expecting to be well cared for. They thought they could trust a U.S. Army doctor, but we now understand that the doctor abused that trust in the most egregious way,"" said Christine Dunn, the law firm's DC Co-Managing Partner.

The FTCA allows individuals to bring legal claims against federal agencies for wrongdoing by their employees. Before filing a lawsuit in court, individuals must first file administrative complaints with the agency, which then has at least six months to investigate.

The complaints allege the Army is liable for McGraw's actions because it was negligent in hiring, supervising and retaining him. They also claim the Army lacked adequate protocols to protect patients from sexual abuse.

""The Army had a duty to take reasonable measures to protect patients in its care. To the extent that Dr. McGraw was able to abuse so many patients, it is compelling evidence that the Army was negligent in supervising him,"" Dunn said.

Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.
Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.
Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.
Though DHA agreed with the recommendations, auditors said they were still awaiting specific actions on how the agency plans to make a comprehensive review of staffing at overseas military treatment facilities.","The average wait for urgent medical appointments at U.S. military bases outside the continental United States was as long as three weeks in some locations and even longer for routine appointments in 2024, a Pentagon watchdog agency said in a new report.

Treatment delays that service members and their families face while stationed outside the United States increased the risk for negative outcomes and preventable complications and decreased patient satisfaction, according to a Defense Department Office of Inspector General audit published last week.

The report also found that personnel working in military medical clinics and hospitals overseas experienced burnout and low morale and were at risk of decreased readiness.

The agency reviewed 15 out of 79 military treatment facilities in overseas locations as well as Hawaii and Alaska, looking at 2024 data and conducting employee interviews.

The evaluation sought to assess how effectively the Defense Health Agency was managing care for its overseas patients, following the agency’s transition in 2022 to assuming full control of the Pentagon’s health care system.

Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.

Between February and July 2024, service members and their families faced delays in access to care ranging on average from 1.2 days to 21.1 days for urgent appointments and from 7.2 days to 36.8 days for future routine appointments, the report said.

Federal and DOD guidance requires the military health care system to see patients within 24 hours for urgent appointments and seven days for routine care, according to the inspector general report.

While the guidelines allow for patients to be referred to a Tricare-approved civilian provider within the allotted time frame, finding care outside the military network overseas can be challenging due to language barriers, cultural differences and denial of U.S. health insurance claims, the report said.

DHA’s management of staffing at overseas locations is one area that needs to be improved to reduce appointment delays, the audit team determined.

Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.

They also said that they had difficulty managing the volume of messages received from the online patient portal and that sometimes messages could be missed, putting patient safety at risk.

At one clinic, for example, providers did not see a prescription refill message and the patient did not follow up with another request. As a result, the patient did not take prescribed antidepressant medication for two to three weeks, according to the report.

At another military treatment facility, personnel said shortages in medical technicians led to canceled ultrasound appointments, delaying follow-on medical care and leading to an increased risk of preventable complications, according to the report.

Staffing data also showed shortages in personnel, according to the report. In September 2024, for example, one facility had only 27 of the 36 civilian personnel and 27 of the 37 contractors that it was authorized.

Another facility lost more than half its primary care clinic active-duty doctors between 2019 and 2024 and saw a 20% decrease in active-duty technicians, medics and licensed nurses, while patient workload remained steady, according to the report.

Hiring civilian staff, meanwhile, isn’t always an option due to funding and lengthy hiring timelines, personnel told auditors.

In 2024, DHA left some civilian vacancies unfilled because of budgetary constraints, and the average total days to hire in some locations ranged from 155 to 213 days, the report said.

Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.

To address staffing issues, the inspector general team recommended that the DHA director track data on why personnel are leaving military treatment facilities, review authorized staffing at its overseas locations, track support staff availability and better balance its workforce.

Though DHA agreed with the recommendations, auditors said they were still awaiting specific actions on how the agency plans to make a comprehensive review of staffing at overseas military treatment facilities.

The inspector general issued 11 recommendations in total, including directing DHA to issue finalized guidance to its personnel and better manage data discrepancies reported to the team.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/ecvmvf-161225dhaphoto02.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/161225DHAphoto02.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-12-15 11:56:30.711796

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

Q3 2025 Results Reveal Profound Erosion The company's third-quarter 2025 financial report laid bare the depth of its difficulties.","The medical technology firm Zynex is confronting a severe financial crisis, with its shares plummeting to a mere $0.74. This represents a staggering decline of more than 90% over the past twelve months, signaling challenges that extend beyond operations to threaten the company's very survival.

In response to the escalating situation, Zynex has engaged the services of investment bank Province, LLC to evaluate strategic alternatives. A special committee of independent directors, chaired by restructuring specialist Paul Aronzon, is now tasked with assessing options for raising capital and executing a comprehensive corporate turnaround.

The most pressing immediate concern is a persistent payment suspension from Tricare, Zynex's primary health insurance client. Despite an appeal filed in April 2025, the suspension remains in effect, continuing to severely pressure revenue streams with no clear resolution in sight.

Compounding these issues, the company has entered a critical phase regarding its debt obligations. Zynex missed a $1.5 million interest payment on convertible notes, triggering a 30-day grace period. Management is currently in negotiations with noteholders to restructure these obligations.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Zynex?

Q3 2025 Results Reveal Profound Erosion

The company's third-quarter 2025 financial report laid bare the depth of its difficulties. Net revenue collapsed by 73% year-over-year to just $13.4 million. This drastic drop contributed to a substantial net loss of $42.9 million for the quarter. Furthermore, Zynex recorded a significant $30.7 million impairment charge related to goodwill and fixed assets. As of the end of September, the company's cash and equivalents stood at $13.3 million.

Analyst Sentiment Remains Cautious

Market experts maintain a guarded stance on the equity. The consensus rating among analysts currently sits at ""Hold."" The average price target from four covering firms is $4.90, with estimates ranging from $3.00 to $8.00 per share. These projections, however, appear at odds with full-year 2025 forecasts, which anticipate a net loss of approximately $40.6 million.

The upcoming weeks are poised to be decisive for Zynex. Should leadership fail to secure an agreement with creditors and attract fresh capital and confidence, the company risks descending into an even more profound crisis.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2407176_600_800.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-12-14 16:56:20.508842

KEY QUOTES: “People who are struggling with mental health can’t wait years to see if something might help through trial and error.
We believe this work can meaningfully expand access to effective mental health care.” Reva Nohria, Partner at General Catalyst “In research, we’ve proven that these powerful treatments work.
We’re taking what we know from years of clinical research and turning it into care that any patient can access.
Radial is focused on the care patients have long deserved.”","Radial has launched with $50 million in venture funding to expand access to advanced mental health treatments, including neuromodulation such as accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation and rapid-acting medications such as Spravato. General Catalyst led the Series A round, with additional backing from Solari Capital, JSL Health Capital, Founder Collective, BoxGroup, Scrub Capital, and Diede van Lamoen.

The company is positioning itself around a shift in psychiatry toward interventional, brain-based care that can deliver results in days to weeks rather than prolonged trial and error. Radial cited evidence that newer approaches can produce significantly improved outcomes for patients with mental health conditions, including published findings showing remission rates as high as 78% in some studies, while emphasizing that the broader healthcare delivery model has not been built to support episodic interventional care at scale.

Radial’s strategy is to build the clinical and operational infrastructure that enables these treatments to be delivered consistently, measured rigorously, and reimbursed reliably. The company said it is developing reimbursement tools and decision support designed around modern brain medicine, aiming to help clinicians focus on care delivery while giving payers more precise outcomes data to support coverage decisions. Radial also plans to address what it described as gaps in clinical decision support and operational tooling that can slow adoption of advanced treatments across everyday practice.

A core component of the rollout is a national clinic network that accepts most major insurance plans. Radial said its clinics are set up to accept Medicare, Tricare, VA CCN, Aetna, Cigna, United, and many Blue plans, to make high-impact treatment combinations available beyond cash-pay models and limited specialty access. The company framed this approach as a benefit to patients seeking faster symptom relief, providers seeking more practical workflows, and payers seeking better outcomes and lower long-term costs for complex cases.

Radial currently operates seven clinics across six states, supported by a proprietary software platform. The company said the new funding will support national expansion in 2026, including growth of both its clinic footprint and technology partnerships as it scales its model for interventional mental health care.

KEY QUOTES:

“People who are struggling with mental health can’t wait years to see if something might help through trial and error. New rapid-acting treatments work in days or weeks instead of years. We’re seeing remission rates for depression of 50-60% and as high as 78% in some studies our team has co-authored. The healthcare system hasn’t caught up. Radial is here to change that. When we have tools for the right clinical workflows and insurance pathways, people can access therapies that help them get better far sooner. It’s a dramatic difference for individuals, for families, and for the health system that ends up carrying the cost when care drags on without results.”

John Capecelatro, CEO and Co-Founder of Radial

“Psychiatry is undergoing a transformation, but most of that progress hasn’t reached patients. The science is there, yet the infrastructure to deliver modern, brain-based treatments at scale is still missing. Radial understands both the clinical evidence and the operational complexity required to close that gap. We believe this work can meaningfully expand access to effective mental health care.”

Reva Nohria, Partner at General Catalyst

“In research, we’ve proven that these powerful treatments work. They change lives. The hard part has always been bringing them into everyday clinical practice. Radial was built to close that gap. We’re taking what we know from years of clinical research and turning it into care that any patient can access. Radial is focused on the care patients have long deserved.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/12/Radial-Logo.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-12-14 14:56:33.586000

We have prime and didn't pay to deliver on base. Do you have the option to deliver on base or are you in an area with no medical center or have a high risk baby?

We can't afford Select with our medical kids. Consider all your options.

As long as your doctor takes your tricare you’re good. I delivered vaginally, stayed two days, had an epidural, and my bill was $45. ETA: my OBs had me fill out all of my paperwork in advance for the hospital, so I just went in and had the babies. You’ll likely know ahead of time if there are any issues.

I had my daughter when we were at Elgin. I switched to select to have her at the birth center, which I don't think is open anymore..?? I had to pay the $250 and they charged another $1,000 fee because Tricare doesn't pay them enough. But it was worth it to avoid the base hospital.

I delivered in Austin while stationed at fort hood with select in 2023. I paid $65 for my failed induction turned c section that racked up a $70,000 bill. We didn't pay anything for the baby's pediatric bill from the hospital. Just make sure that your hospital is an in-network provider, if it's out of network your copay (after met deductible) might be slightly higher.",,N,-1.0,2025-12-14 10:56:42.077495

This service is particularly beneficial for those unable to visit a provider’s office in person.

Accessing Virtual Mental Health Care with TRICARE

TRICARE offers a comprehensive range of mental health services, including:

Outpatient services

Inpatient services

Emergency care

Nonemergency care

Substance use disorder services

Virtual visits utilize secure technology, allowing users to receive necessary care flexibly. Thomas Turnbaugh, a behavioral health specialist at the Defense Health Agency, highlights the convenience of these services, saying, “You have several different options for seeking this care, regardless of which TRICARE plan you have or where you live.”

Eligibility and Requirements for Virtual Care

For virtual mental health care within the U.S., patients should first connect with their regional contractor to identify an appropriate provider. Those receiving care at military hospitals may also access some virtual mental health services directly at their facility.

Notably, active-duty service members require a referral and pre-authorization from their primary care managers to utilize these virtual services.

Overseas Access to Virtual Mental Health Services

For individuals living outside the U.S., virtual mental health services are accessible as long as certain criteria are met:

The service must be a TRICARE-covered benefit suitable for virtual care.

The host country must permit virtual health services.

The provider must be TRICARE-authorized and licensed in that country.

The provider must understand local protocols for emergencies.

Those using TRICARE Overseas Program should contact their regional call center for specific provider information and potential referral requirements.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare Changes

TRICARE For Life beneficiaries should be aware of recent updates concerning Medicare’s virtual health coverage. Starting October 1, 2025, most virtual health services will necessitate in-person visits at rural facilities in the U.S. However, virtual mental health services, including those for substance use disorders, can still be accessed from home.

Before scheduling any appointments, beneficiaries should verify coverage details through TRICARE and Medicare to ensure they are informed about their options. TRICARE will cover costs first if Medicare does not.

Requirements for Using Virtual Mental Health Services

To effectively use TRICARE’s virtual mental health services, individuals need the following:

A computer or smartphone for video consultations

A telephone for audio-only consultations

A secure internet connection

Referrals or pre-authorizations, if applicable

The costs associated with virtual visits are generally comparable to those of in-person appointments. Patients will need to account for typical co-pays and cost shares.

TRICARE remains dedicated to enhancing access to mental health care for service members and their families, ensuring support is readily available when needed.

By Gizem Nisa Demir

ISTANBUL (AA) - Eighty-one women have now joined a civil lawsuit in Texas accusing a US Army gynecologist at Fort Hood of sexual misconduct during medical exams, as the army faces growing scrutiny over patient safety and internal oversight.

Newsmax reported Friday that the expanded complaint, filed in Bell County, alleges Maj. Blaine McGraw covertly recorded patients, engaged in inappropriate touching, and conducted intrusive, unnecessary exams while serving at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.

The civil case runs alongside an ongoing criminal prosecution, in which army prosecutors have charged McGraw with more than 50 specifications of “indecent visual recording” involving dozens of alleged victims, according to army officials.

- Monitoring case 'very closely'

Army leadership has acknowledged the gravity of the allegations. Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre recently visited the Fort Hood facility to review Defense Health Agency policies.

“Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,” Obadal said.

“I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and army readiness.”

A US official, speaking anonymously, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the case “very, very closely” and ordered a fact-finding mission to assess conditions “on the ground.”

“It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the army and the military try to uphold,” the official added.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement at the Bell County Jail since early December. Army officials say he was removed from patient care in October, within hours of the first complaint. Defense attorneys have not publicly responded to the expanded lawsuit.

A civil lawsuit against Army Maj. Blaine McGraw expanded this week when the women added claims accusing the gynecologist of inappropriate touching, covert filming, and other alleged misconduct during medical exams.

The development is the latest in a case already under criminal prosecution and now prompting official Army leadership statements.

McGraw, a medical officer at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, was charged by the Army’s Office of Special Trial Counsel with more than 50 specifications of ""indecent visual recording"" and related offenses involving dozens of victims, according to Army officials.

The expanded civil complaint, filed in Bell County, Texas, alleges McGraw violated state assault, sexual assault, and battery laws and harmed patients through intrusive and unnecessary exams.

Plaintiffs say McGraw took advantage of his position of trust to record intimate procedures secretly.

In published statements, Army leaders acknowledged the seriousness of the allegations and outlined steps being taken to review policies and protect patients.

Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre visited the medical center to review Defense Health Agency policies.

""Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,"" Obadal said.

""I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and Army readiness.""

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity about internal Army leadership discussions, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the situation ""very, very closely"" and dispatched the team at Fort Hood as a fact-finding mission to understand the situation ""on the ground.""

""It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the Army and the military try to uphold,"" the official said.

The civil complaint also contends that McGraw ""failed to document in her medical records that a rape kit had ever been performed,"" which the plaintiff’s lawyers argued interfered with subsequent criminal prosecution of an alleged assailant.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement in Bell County Jail since early December.

Army officials say he was suspended from patient care in October after the first allegations surfaced and that investigators began reviewing his conduct within hours of the initial complaint.

Attorneys for the women filed the expanded civil complaint shortly after the government announced criminal charges.

The lawsuit includes alleged victims from Texas and other states, reflecting a broader pattern of claims spanning McGraw’s Army career.

It has passed the 90 day deadline and I received no letter regarding it due to a recent move.
I put in a reinstatement request and haven’t heard anything back.
I have a child on the way due in March and we have no coverage now and I don’t know what to do.
Has anyone else been in a similar situation?","Hello, I have just recently been given a lockout of tricare reserve.
