Common Pitfalls to Avoid When Filing Your TRICARE Claim Filing a claim sounds easy enough, but slip-ups happen — and they cost you time and money.
Expert Tricks to Speed Up Your TRICARE Claim Processing Want to fast-track your claim?","Understanding TRICARE Claims: A Quick Overview for Beginners

Getting started with TRICARE claims can quickly feel overwhelming, especially if this is your first time navigating military health benefits. But don’t worry — understanding the basics puts you ahead of the game. Essentially, TRICARE is the health care program for military members, retirees, and their families, covering medical services with varying plans and regions.

A TRICARE claim is simply a request for payment when you receive care from a provider. In many cases, if you go to a TRICARE-authorized provider, they’ll submit claims on your behalf automatically. It’s with non-network providers or certain services where you might need to file your own claim.

Knowing when and how to file a claim saves you time and prevents headaches like delayed payments or denied benefits. Plus, understanding the paperwork and submission channels helps you avoid common pitfalls.

Here’s a quick video that breaks down the essentials of filing claims for both Medicare and TRICARE, which can clarify a lot of questions for beginners:

It’s great for visual learners who like to see the process in action before diving into forms and steps.

Step 1: Gathering Your Essential Documents Without Stress

The last thing anyone wants is to start filing a claim only to realize key documents are missing. The paperwork is critical — it makes or breaks your claim approval. Here’s what you’ll need to get ready before submitting:

Detailed medical bills or receipts: These show what you were charged for and break down services or treatments. Make sure these come from your healthcare provider.

Healthcare provider’s details: Name, address, and tax ID number (you might see “TIN” or “NPI” on the form).

Your TRICARE insurance information: Include your sponsor’s Social Security number or DoD ID, and your personal details.

Claim forms: Depending on the service, you might have to fill out a CMS-1500 form for physicians or a UB-04 for hospital services.

Explanation of Benefits (EOB), if applicable: Sometimes you file a claim to dispute or complement a processed EOB.

Pro tip: Keep copies (paper or scanned) of every document you submit. It’s your backup in case something gets misplaced or delayed.

Step 2: How to Submit Your TRICARE Claim Online Like a Pro

Say goodbye to losing claims in the mail! Submitting claims online is fast, secure, and much less stressful than paper forms. TRICARE offers different ways to file electronically depending on your plan and region.

Here’s the streamlined process that’ll make your life easier:

Visit the official TRICARE claims website: Head to the TRICARE File a Claim Online portal.

Create or log into your account: You’ll need to have a valid login tied to your TRICARE benefits.

Fill out the online claim form: Enter service details, provider info, and attach scanned documents or photos of bills and receipts. The online system will guide you through the required fields.

Double-check and submit: Review everything closely before hitting submit — a simple typo can make your claim bounce back.

News from a recent official source confirms that filing claims online cuts processing time considerably, making this method ideal for anyone wanting to track claims quickly and avoid paper delays (Filing Claims).

Still prefer paper for some reason? Don’t sweat it. You can mail claims using the standard CMS-1500 form or UB-04 form, but that’s a much slower route with more chance of delays.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid When Filing Your TRICARE Claim

Filing a claim sounds easy enough, but slip-ups happen — and they cost you time and money. Here’s where most people trip up:

Incomplete or incorrect forms: Missing fields or bad provider info sends your claim into a black hole. Make sure every box is filled and legible.

Losing deadlines: Some claims must be filed within a year (or less) of service. Keep an eye on those dates!

Submitting duplicate claims: This causes confusion and can delay payments or cause denials.

Not attaching all required documents: Your claim’s like a puzzle — missing pieces mean no approval.

Using out-of-network providers without prior authorization: Some TRICARE plans require pre-approval — skipping this will most likely result in denied claims.

Basically, triple-check your paperwork before sending it out. Getting help from a benefits advisor or calling TRICARE customer service can save headaches if you’re unsure.

What to Expect After Submitting: Tracking and Follow-Up Tips

Once you’ve hit “send” on your claim, the waiting game begins. Don’t panic if you don’t see payment immediately — claim processing usually takes anywhere from a few days to several weeks depending on complexity and volume.

A useful trick: use the TRICARE claims status portal to check your claim’s progress. Some regions even send email or text alerts for updates.

If your claim gets denied or sent back for corrections, don’t shrug and ignore it — review the denial reason carefully, fix the issue, and resubmit promptly.

Good record keeping means you’ll be ready to respond quickly. Keep a file with your claim number, date of submission, and any communication — it can be golden if there’s a dispute.

Expert Tricks to Speed Up Your TRICARE Claim Processing

Want to fast-track your claim? Here are some insider tips that can shave days or weeks off the timeline:

Go paperless: Electronic claims are reviewed immediately, while paper claims can sit in mail for days.

Submit during regular hours: Avoid filing claims late on Fridays or weekends when queues back up.

Use exact, clear documentation: Clarity prevents back-and-forth — avoid vague or jumbled bills.

Consult TRICARE’s guidelines: Following their step-by-step instructions reduces errors that cause delays.

Recheck provider network rules: Staying in-network often means faster payment and less hassle.

The official TRICARE resources stress that careful preparation and electronic filing are your best bets for swift claim processing (Medical Claims).

Real-Life Scenarios: How Different TRICARE Beneficiaries Handle Claims

Every TRICARE beneficiary’s claim story is a little different. Take Joe, an active duty member — his claims are mostly handled by military treatment facilities, so his paperwork is minimal and he rarely files a claim himself.

On the other hand, Sarah, a military spouse using civilian doctors, finds herself filing claims for out-of-network services. She swears by keeping a checklist and submitting claims online — it keeps her sane and she gets reimbursements quicker.

Then there’s retired veteran Tom, who sometimes gets confused about which plan covers what. His tip? “Don’t be shy to call TRICARE customer service or your regional contractor. They really help clear things up.”

One thing everyone agrees on: staying organized is key. If you’ve got multiple claims to handle, an app or simple spreadsheet can track submissions, deadlines, and responses.

Leapfrog denies that, but the low scores underscore tensions between hospitals and rating organizations over patient safety evaluations.","Florida ranks No. 15 in the nation for hospital safety in the latest grading by the Leapfrog Group, with 37.9% of its hospitals earning an “A.”

The fall 2025 report underscores a major shift in U.S. health care: large health systems are now overwhelmingly driving the nation’s highest safety performance.

Two of the systems with the biggest presence in Florida, HCA Healthcare and AdventHealth, are among the three best-performing chains in the country.

Leapfrog’s new system-level scoring, launched this year, found that 94% of all ""A"" hospitals nationwide are part of a health system. Just one in 10 is independent, and the systems that dominate states such as Florida are emerging as the nation’s strongest performers in preventing patient harm.

HCA Healthcare — the largest hospital operator in Florida — tops the national list with 51 hospitals earning A grades and 18 receiving Straight A recognition (A’s for at least two consecutive years). AdventHealth ranks third nationally, with 29 A hospitals and 21 Straight A hospitals.

Both systems have extensive footprints across Florida, a factor that likely boosted the state’s overall ranking.

Florida’s ranking places it ahead of populous states such as New York and California but well behind top states such as Utah, which has led the nation for five consecutive grading cycles. Four states — Iowa, Vermont, North Dakota and Wyoming — recorded no ""A"" hospitals.

Consolidation becomes central to safety outcomes

Leah Binder, president and CEO of the Leapfrog Group, said the organization began analyzing performance by health system because consolidation has reshaped hospital care in the U.S.

“Some systems are doing an excellent job with safety,” Binder said. “They have a plan. They have a strategy at the system level for how they are going to drive better and safer outcomes for their patients.”

NATIONAL: Where did your hospital finish in the latest Leapfrog report?

The data show the depth of the shift: 95% of Straight A hospitals are system-affiliated, and one in eight hospitals maintained ""A"" grades for more than two years. Eleven hospitals nationwide have earned an A in every one of the 27 grading cycles since Leapfrog launched the report.

Binder said consolidation has been criticized for driving higher prices and reducing competition, but the new data suggest a potential offsetting benefit — a consistent and measurable improvement in safety when systems operate with shared standards and shared technology.

Florida’s results reflect metro vs. rural

Florida hospitals largely maintain strong patient safety performance, with many of the state’s largest systems earning high marks from Leapfrog. AdventHealth, UF Health, Orlando Health, and Baptist Health have multiple hospitals with straight A grades, reflecting consistent attention to quality and safety.

FLORIDA: How did your hospital fare in the Leapfrog safety rankings?

Not all hospitals perform at the same level. Some facilities, particularly smaller or rural hospitals, show mixed results with B, C, and a few D grades. Critical access hospitals often fall into this group, highlighting the challenge of maintaining top safety standards statewide.

A clear geographic pattern emerges, with A hospitals concentrated in metro areas such as Orlando, Tampa, Miami, and Jacksonville, while rural counties show more variability. Leapfrog data show that hospitals can improve over time, as several have moved from lower grades to A or B ratings in recent cycles.

Tampa General Hospital, an independent nonprofit with an expanding footprint, has consistently received C grades in Leapfrog’s safety evaluations.

ALSO READ: South Florida hospitals, Leapfrog Group seek court ruling over safety grades

Overall, Florida has a strong base of high-performing hospitals, but low-scoring facilities and legal disputes like Tenet’s highlight areas for improvement. Patients and policymakers continue to rely on these grades to identify safe hospitals and guide safety initiatives.

Grades for five Tenet Healthcare hospitals in South Florida are notable: four with ""D"" grades and Delray Medical Center receiving Florida’s only ""F."" The hospitals have filed a lawsuit against Leapfrog, alleging a “rigged” methodology and pressure on hospitals to pay for memberships. Leapfrog denies that, but the low scores underscore tensions between hospitals and rating organizations over patient safety evaluations.

AdventHealth: “You have to put the flag in the ground”

AdventHealth president and CEO David Banks said his system’s performance reflects decisions made years ago to unify technology, training and leadership incentives.

“We have migrated to one [electronic medical records] platform,” Banks said. “It allows for consistency of training, and it allows us to also then align our leadership incentives.”

Safety improvements, he said, depend on system-level investments in bar coding, computerized order entry and other tools that reduce human error. But culture matters as much as technology.

“Leadership have to put the flag in the ground and say the first deliverable we owe as part of our responsibility to the community is safe care,” Banks said. “We’ve built the systems that make it more possible for our frontline clinicians to get it right.”

The House Appropriations Committee on Nov. 6 reported Senate Bill 370, a proposal to create a TRICARE premium reimbursement program that would subsidize health and dental coverage for members of the Michigan National Guard.

Chris Young, testifying on behalf of Sen. Sam Singh, told the committee the proposal is intended to help service members who work in sectors that often lack employer-sponsored insurance, such as seasonal service jobs and independent contracting. ""Providing health and dental insurance, for those members helps address 3 critical issues facing the department: recruitment, retention, and troop readiness,"" Young said.

Young cited Maryland’s ""Health Care for Heroes"" program as a model and said the bill would reduce instances in which guard members delay care until they are called to active duty and thereby limit their ability to serve immediately. He said the program is part of a three-bill package and is implemented as a budget-related measure.

Committee members expressed support. Rep. Farhat thanked authors and partners for pursuing the idea, and Chair Boland said the proposal is consistent with the budget approach the committee has taken. Rep. Snyder moved to report the bill out of committee; the clerk recorded 23 yays, 0 nays and the motion prevailed.

The committee’s action sends SB 370 out of appropriations for further consideration by the full House and other legislative steps. No committee amendments were presented during this hearing.

Every shift in the emergency department contributes to that vision: a medically ready force and a ready medical force.
Professional Excellence in Action For emergency nurse Brittany Ratliff, a registered nurse, working in the BJACH ER is both demanding and deeply rewarding.","FORT POLK, La. — The emergency department at Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital is more than a place for urgent medical care — it’s a cornerstone of readiness for Soldiers, Families and the broader Fort Polk community. During Emergency Nurses Week, observed Oct. 6–12, BJACH recognizes the nurses who provide calm, capable care amid the chaos of crisis.

Maj. Tynika B. Reese, clinical nurse officer in charge of the emergency department, said adaptability, composure and teamwork define Army emergency nursing.

“Adaptability and composure are everything,” Reese said. “You can teach skills, but you can’t teach heart, and our nurses have that in spades. Whether it’s in a trauma bay or a field environment, they think critically, act decisively and bring compassion into every situation.”

Reese said her team’s expertise directly supports the Army’s readiness mission.

“We’re often the first stop when something goes wrong, so our job is about more than treating emergencies — it’s about keeping Soldiers and Families healthy, informed and confident in their care,” she said. “When they know they can depend on us, it builds trust in the whole system. That trust allows Soldiers to focus fully on the mission.”

A Ready Team for a Ready Force

From heat-related injuries during field training to pediatric emergencies and community care, BJACH’s emergency nurses handle every case with a mission-first mindset. Each nurse understands that clinical excellence under pressure enables the operational readiness of the force.

Col. Patrick W. Miller, BJACH commander, said the department’s impact extends far beyond the hospital walls.

“Our Emergency Department is continually lauded by patients, and it doesn’t go unnoticed,” Miller said. “The emergency department is an essential capability for Soldiers and Families stationed at the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk, for our retiree population in the surrounding community, and for the rotational units conducting dangerous and realistic training to increase their lethality on the battlefield. Our emergency nurses make a real difference in the lives of our patients every single day.”

Miller said that impact reflects the priorities outlined by Secretary of War Hegseth — building a lethal, resilient and disciplined force supported by world-class healthcare delivery. Every shift in the emergency department contributes to that vision: a medically ready force and a ready medical force.

Professional Excellence in Action

For emergency nurse Brittany Ratliff, a registered nurse, working in the BJACH ER is both demanding and deeply rewarding.

“I love the pace and the acuity,” Ratliff said. “We train constantly to handle anything that walks through the door, and we depend on each other completely. The teamwork here is unmatched — it’s what allows us to provide the best care for Soldiers and their Families.”

Emergency nurse Kristin Plank, a registered nurse, said calm professionalism is essential to delivering safe, effective care under pressure.

“It’s about staying grounded when everything around you feels unpredictable,” Plank said. “Your calm sets the tone for the entire room — and that makes all the difference in patient outcomes.”

Collin Seaman, a registered nurse, said being part of a mission-focused healthcare team in the emergency department gives her purpose.

“Helping patients feel safe and cared for gives me a strong sense of fulfillment,” Seaman said. “Every patient represents a Soldier, a Family member or a retiree — and each deserves the best care possible.”

Trish Keys, a licensed practical nurse, said strong leadership and camaraderie sustain the emergency team through tough days.

“We make the best of all situations,” Keys said. “We have leaders who support us and providers who go above and beyond. We lean on each other so we can always give our best to the patients who depend on us.”

Keys added that teamwork with physicians and physician assistants is essential to providing safe, efficient care.

“Our doctors and physician assistants go above and beyond to make our days great,” she said. “It really is a team effort — and that makes a difference in patient care.”

Caring for the Force, Strengthening the Nation

BJACH’s emergency department plays a critical role in the Military Health System’s mission: sustaining readiness through trusted, high-quality, patient-centered care. From trauma response to compassionate communication, the department embodies the Military Health System’s core priorities — increase the lethality of the warfighter, sustain the skills of the medical force and ensure accessible, high-quality, and sustainable care.

Reese said the emergency department’s strength lies in its people.

“They are calm in the chaos,” she said. “They bring order to uncertainty, hope to hardship and professionalism to every patient encounter. That’s what readiness looks like in healthcare.” Reese said the emergency department’s strength lies in its people. “They are calm in the chaos,” she said. “They bring order to uncertainty, hope to hardship and professionalism to every patient encounter. That’s what readiness looks like in healthcare.”

Honoring the Front Line of Care

As the Army continues to modernize and strengthen its medical capabilities, emergency nurses remain at the heart of the mission — ensuring Soldiers can fight tonight and Families can rest easy knowing they’re in capable hands.

According to Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital leadership, Emergency Nurses Week is more than a celebration — it’s recognition of the nurses who keep the force healthy, the mission moving and the nation strong.",,N,0.0,2025-11-13 20:56:36.863530

While working under 65 and enrolled in FEHB, FEHB pays first and TRICARE second.
While working at 65 or older and enrolled in FEHB, FEHB pays first, Medicare second, and TRICARE last.
Because Medicare and TFL are a great combination, a federal employee over 65 who is eligible for TRICARE must decide between delaying TFL and Medicare enrollment or canceling FEHB to use TFL and Medicare.
It is common for federal employees who work beyond 65 to delay Medicare/TFL, use FEHB during employment, and then enroll in Medicare/TFL using the Medicare Part B SEP.","According to Office of Personnel Management data, as of September 2024, around 5% -- or roughly 100,000 -- of the federal workforce was older than 65.

Considering the large number of employees taking advantage of retirement under the Deferred Resignation Program, some of this group may have retired in 2025.

It was estimated that 60,000 new retirements occurred on Sept. 30, with 20,344 of them arriving at OPM for processing in October. The rest may be in process with the agency HR office or payroll provider.

Many requests for assistance to understand the relationship between Medicare and FEHB have arrived in the Retire Federal email box, so today is a good day to review this information.

One of the reasons individuals delay enrollment in Medicare Part B is that they are covered by “current employment” group health insurance such as FEHB.

While covered under your own or your spouse’s current employment health insurance, there is generally no reason to enroll in Part B since no late enrollment penalty is assessed during this period.

Part B would pay as the secondary payer during this time, so after the FEHB plan pays its share, there is little left for Medicare to cover. There are no incentives provided by FEHB carriers to enroll in Medicare until Medicare becomes the primary payer.

To enroll in Medicare Part B without a late enrollment penalty after employment ends if you are over age 65, there is a Special Enrollment Period, or SEP, that allows enrollment during employment and up to eight months after employment ends.

To document your “current employment” health coverage, you must provide evidence that you were covered by your own or your spouse’s current employment coverage since age 65 or since you canceled your Part B enrollment to be covered under a current employment plan.

CMS Form L-564 can help facilitate this process. In lieu of this document, Social Security will also accept the following documents, according to the Social Security Program Operations Manual: income tax returns showing health insurance premiums paid; W-2s reflecting pre-tax medical contributions; pay stubs showing health insurance premium deductions; health insurance cards with a policy effective date; explanations of benefits paid by the group health plan; and statements or receipts reflecting payment of health insurance premiums.

The evidence may be in any form if all the following are present: there is no question that the evidence comes from the employer or the group health plan, except where they cannot provide such evidence; the evidence indicates, or can be determined, when the beneficiary had group health plan coverage based on current employment; and the evidence indicates, or can be determined, where applicable, the end date of coverage.

Learn more about the SEP from this fact sheet: How to Apply for Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) During Your Special Enrollment Period.

For military retirees eligible for TRICARE for Life, those eligible to participate in both TRICARE or Medicare/TRICARE For Life (TFL) and FEHB programs should keep in mind that when a TRICARE beneficiary has other health insurance, by law, TRICARE pays only after all other health insurance, with limited exceptions.

While working under 65 and enrolled in FEHB, FEHB pays first and TRICARE second. While working at 65 or older and enrolled in FEHB, FEHB pays first, Medicare second, and TRICARE last.

Because Medicare and TFL are a great combination, a federal employee over 65 who is eligible for TRICARE must decide between delaying TFL and Medicare enrollment or canceling FEHB to use TFL and Medicare.

Although an employee can be covered under FEHB, TFL, and Medicare while employed, FEHB as the primary payer will generally be the only one of the three that pays for most medical needs.

To have FEHB in retirement, an employee must be covered by FEHB on the day of retirement and have coverage for the last five years prior. TRICARE can be used to meet part of the five-year requirement; however, the individual must be enrolled in FEHB before retirement and have it effective on the last day of employment.

It is common for federal employees who work beyond 65 to delay Medicare/TFL, use FEHB during employment, and then enroll in Medicare/TFL using the Medicare Part B SEP.

If you are retired, over 65, and no longer eligible for your IEP or an SEP based on current employment, you may want to learn about Medicare Part B enrollment during the annual General Enrollment Period, or GEP, which runs from January 1 through March 31, with coverage effective the month after enrollment.

To enroll during the GEP, contact Social Security: call +1 800-772-1213, available in most U.S. time zones Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., in English, Spanish, and other languages. For an office near you, visit SSA.gov/locator. Tell the representative you need help enrolling in Part B during the GEP.

One of the problems with waiting past 65 to enroll during a GEP is that you might face a late enrollment penalty of 10% for every 12 months you could have been enrolled in Part B but weren’t. This is counted from the end of your IEP, which ends three months after your 65th birthday month, or the end of your employment or your spouse’s employment when you had health coverage through current employment.

There is no limit on this penalty. If you had five 12-month periods before your enrollment is effective, you would be charged a penalty of 50% of the standard rate for Part B every year for the rest of your life.

For example, if you turned 65 in February 2023, your IEP ended in May 2023. If you enroll in Part B during the GEP in January 2026, your coverage would be effective in February. From the end of your IEP until your coverage takes effect includes June–December 2023 (7 months); January–December 2024 (12 months); January–December 2025 (12 months); and January 2026 (1 month), for a total of two full 12-month periods, with the additional eight months not causing another penalty. The penalty would be 20% of the standard Part B premium, or $206.50 × 20% = $41.30 per month.

The premium may also include an IRMAA surcharge if your modified adjusted gross income from your 2024 tax return was higher than $109,000 for a single taxpayer or $218,000 for married filing jointly. The first IRMAA level would add another $82.60 to the monthly premium. The next IRMAA level is for a 2024 MAGI above $137,000 (single) or $274,000 (joint), with a surcharge of $206.50. Higher IRMAA levels exist for income exceeding $171,000 (single) and $342,000 (joint).

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has a short video explaining the late enrollment penalty.

Is it still worth signing up for Medicare if you are subject to IRMAA or a late enrollment penalty? There is no one-size-fits-all answer, but consider the following:

If you reach your FEHB plan’s catastrophic out-of-pocket cap regularly, this can add $6,000, $10,000, or in some plans more than $20,000 in out-of-pocket medical expenses in addition to premiums.

Considering the proposed annual standard rate for Part B in 2026 is $2,478 per person ($206.50 × 12), having an FEHB plan that waives cost-sharing can be worth considering. For someone paying a 20% or 30% late enrollment penalty, the savings could outweigh the cost of enrolling in Part B.

Many individuals won’t realize this benefit until later in life when the cost of Part B can more than double.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries with the following conditions is:

Four or more chronic conditions: 45%

Functional impairment (1+ ADL): 28%

Fair or poor health status: 21%

Cognitive impairment: 17%

You may be able to enroll in a less expensive FEHB plan that waives your cost-sharing (deductible, copayments, and coinsurance) when Medicare A and B become primary. These plans may also provide a partial Part B premium rebate. Examples include Aetna Direct, BC/BS Basic, and GEHA High Option.

Several other plans waive cost-sharing but do not provide a rebate, including APWU High Option, BC/BS Standard Option, Compass Rose High Option, Foreign Service Benefit Plan High Option (restricted), GEHA Elevate Plus Option, MHBP Standard Option, MHBP High Deductible Option, and SAMBA High and Standard Options.

Some FEHB plans provide a Medicare Advantage (Part C) benefit, which can reduce monthly Part B premiums by $75, $100, $125, or more. Medicare Advantage plans may also include incentives such as free gym memberships, dental, vision, hearing aid benefits, meal delivery after hospitalization, and non-emergency transportation, as well as Part D prescription drug coverage. To enroll, you must be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. Nationwide FEHB plans offering these benefits include Aetna Advantage, APWU High Option, Compass Rose High Option, Foreign Service Benefit Plan High Option, GEHA Standard and High Options, MHBP Standard Option, and SAMBA High and Standard Options.

Many regional plans and HMOs also have “wrap-around” benefits coordinating Medicare and FEHB coverage. Learn more by visiting plan websites or reviewing Section 9 of the FEHB plan brochure.

“Our Emergency Department is continually lauded by patients, and it doesn’t go unnoticed,” Miller said.
Every shift in the emergency department contributes to that vision: a medically ready force and a ready medical force.
Professional Excellence in Action For emergency nurse Brittany Ratliff, a registered nurse, working in the BJACH ER is both demanding and deeply rewarding.","FORT POLK, La. — The emergency department at Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital is more than a place for urgent medical care — it’s a cornerstone of readiness for Soldiers, Families and the broader Fort Polk community. During Emergency Nurses Week, observed Oct. 6–12, BJACH recognizes the nurses who provide calm, capable care amid the chaos of crisis.

Maj. Tynika B. Reese, clinical nurse officer in charge of the emergency department, said adaptability, composure and teamwork define Army emergency nursing.

“Adaptability and composure are everything,” Reese said. “You can teach skills, but you can’t teach heart, and our nurses have that in spades. Whether it’s in a trauma bay or a field environment, they think critically, act decisively and bring compassion into every situation.”

Reese said her team’s expertise directly supports the Army’s readiness mission.

“We’re often the first stop when something goes wrong, so our job is about more than treating emergencies — it’s about keeping Soldiers and Families healthy, informed and confident in their care,” she said. “When they know they can depend on us, it builds trust in the whole system. That trust allows Soldiers to focus fully on the mission.”

A Ready Team for a Ready Force

From heat-related injuries during field training to pediatric emergencies and community care, BJACH’s emergency nurses handle every case with a mission-first mindset. Each nurse understands that clinical excellence under pressure enables the operational readiness of the force.

Col. Patrick W. Miller, BJACH commander, said the department’s impact extends far beyond the hospital walls.

“Our Emergency Department is continually lauded by patients, and it doesn’t go unnoticed,” Miller said. “The emergency department is an essential capability for Soldiers and Families stationed at the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk, for our retiree population in the surrounding community, and for the rotational units conducting dangerous and realistic training to increase their lethality on the battlefield. Our emergency nurses make a real difference in the lives of our patients every single day.”

Miller said that impact reflects the priorities outlined by Secretary of War Hegseth — building a lethal, resilient and disciplined force supported by world-class healthcare delivery. Every shift in the emergency department contributes to that vision: a medically ready force and a ready medical force.

Professional Excellence in Action

For emergency nurse Brittany Ratliff, a registered nurse, working in the BJACH ER is both demanding and deeply rewarding.

“I love the pace and the acuity,” Ratliff said. “We train constantly to handle anything that walks through the door, and we depend on each other completely. The teamwork here is unmatched — it’s what allows us to provide the best care for Soldiers and their Families.”

Emergency nurse Kristin Plank, a registered nurse, said calm professionalism is essential to delivering safe, effective care under pressure.

“It’s about staying grounded when everything around you feels unpredictable,” Plank said. “Your calm sets the tone for the entire room — and that makes all the difference in patient outcomes.”

Collin Seaman, a registered nurse, said being part of a mission-focused healthcare team in the emergency department gives her purpose.

“Helping patients feel safe and cared for gives me a strong sense of fulfillment,” Seaman said. “Every patient represents a Soldier, a Family member or a retiree — and each deserves the best care possible.”

Trish Keys, a licensed practical nurse, said strong leadership and camaraderie sustain the emergency team through tough days.

“We make the best of all situations,” Keys said. “We have leaders who support us and providers who go above and beyond. We lean on each other so we can always give our best to the patients who depend on us.”

Keys added that teamwork with physicians and physician assistants is essential to providing safe, efficient care.

“Our doctors and physician assistants go above and beyond to make our days great,” she said. “It really is a team effort — and that makes a difference in patient care.”

Caring for the Force, Strengthening the Nation

BJACH’s emergency department plays a critical role in the Military Health System’s mission: sustaining readiness through trusted, high-quality, patient-centered care. From trauma response to compassionate communication, the department embodies the Military Health System’s core priorities — increase the lethality of the warfighter, sustain the skills of the medical force and ensure accessible, high-quality, and sustainable care.

Reese said the emergency department’s strength lies in its people.

“They are calm in the chaos,” she said. “They bring order to uncertainty, hope to hardship and professionalism to every patient encounter. That’s what readiness looks like in healthcare.” Reese said the emergency department’s strength lies in its people. “They are calm in the chaos,” she said. “They bring order to uncertainty, hope to hardship and professionalism to every patient encounter. That’s what readiness looks like in healthcare.”

Honoring the Front Line of Care

As the Army continues to modernize and strengthen its medical capabilities, emergency nurses remain at the heart of the mission — ensuring Soldiers can fight tonight and Families can rest easy knowing they’re in capable hands.

According to Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital leadership, Emergency Nurses Week is more than a celebration — it’s recognition of the nurses who keep the force healthy, the mission moving and the nation strong.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2510/9370504/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-13 15:56:31.673581

Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon.
Reported plans to reduce services include closing inpatient, emergency room, and operating room services at the medical center, which would force patients to get care in the community, putting more of a strain on the local health care system.
“Hospitals in Georgia are already facing cuts and closures of vital services,” Sen. Ossoff wrote to Acting Director David J. Smith.
“I strongly urge DHA protect Eisenhower Army Medical Center from any proposed cuts to care,” Sen. Ossoff continued.
Sen. Ossoff continues working to protect Georgia’s servicemembers and their families serving at Fort Gordon.","Fort Gordon, Ga. — U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff is launching an inquiry into reported plans to reduce services and cut staff at Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon.

Today, Sen. Ossoff launched an inquiry with the Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) requesting more information about reported plans to reduce services at Eisenhower Army Medical Center, which serves between 30,000 to 40,000 active-duty servicemembers, retired servicemembers, their families, and DoD civilians in and around the CSRA.

Reported plans to reduce services include closing inpatient, emergency room, and operating room services at the medical center, which would force patients to get care in the community, putting more of a strain on the local health care system.

“Hospitals in Georgia are already facing cuts and closures of vital services,” Sen. Ossoff wrote to Acting Director David J. Smith. “Any potential reductions in care at DDEAMC risks putting further strain on the Augusta Veterans Affairs Medical Center and surrounding hospitals in the region.”

As part of his inquiry, Sen. Ossoff is also asking if Naval Hospital Jacksonville and Naval Hospital Beaufort are on the list to also see services reduced.

According to local staff, the Army Medical Center has about 60 inpatient beds, 6 operating rooms, and there are approximately 80 residents at the hospital enrolled in 5 DHA graduate medical education programs — Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Orthopedic Surgery, Surgery, and Transitional Year.

“I strongly urge DHA protect Eisenhower Army Medical Center from any proposed cuts to care,” Sen. Ossoff continued.

The reported plans come as Georgia hospitals are already under strain following Medicaid cuts in President Trump’s budget law.

Last month, St. Mary’s Sacred Heart Hospital’s Labor & Delivery unit and Clear Creek OB/GYN closed due in part to Medicaid cuts in Trump’s budget law, after officials said Medicaid cuts in President Trump’s budget law “solidified” their decision. In August, Evans Memorial Hospital in southeast Georgia warned they may have to cut their Intensive Care Unit (ICU), according to the hospital CEO, which he said is a direct result of the Medicaid cuts in the Trump budget law.

Sen. Ossoff continues working to protect Georgia’s servicemembers and their families serving at Fort Gordon.

Last January, two of Sen. Ossoff’s bills became law to ensure Ft. Gordon families have access to early childhood education and to authorize construction of new classrooms at the Cyber Center of Excellence at Fort Gordon.

In 2022, Sen. Ossoff led a bipartisan investigation into the mistreatment and neglect of military families living in privatized housing on Ft. Gordon, uncovering misconduct that many families faced while living in these housing units.

Go to TRICARE Pharmacy.","Do you get prescription drugs through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program? You may have new copayments starting Jan. 1, 2026.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 established TRICARE prescription drug costs. The costs will be in effect through Dec. 31, 2027.

“Most beneficiaries will pay $1 to $9 more per copayment for covered drugs they get through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and TRICARE retail network pharmacies,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Teisha Robertson, chief of the Pharmacy Benefit Integration Branch at the Defense Health Agency. “The cost of generic formulary drugs at retail network pharmacies will stay the same.”

A few things affect your costs, as noted in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Overview Fact Sheet.

1. Your beneficiary category:

• Active duty service members: You’ll pay nothing for covered drugs from military pharmacies, home delivery, and retail network pharmacies.

• Survivors of ADSMs and medically retired service members and their family members: Your copayments won’t change in 2026. Go to Pharmacy Costs to learn more.

• All other beneficiaries: Most copayments will increase in 2026.

2. Your drug’s category

TRICARE groups prescription drugs into four categories:

• Generic formulary drugs

• Brand-name formulary drugs

• Non-formulary drugs

• Non-covered drugs

There are a few things you should know about drug categories:

• Generic formulary drugs are the least expensive. This is followed by brand-name formulary drugs and non-formulary drugs.

• You can get a non-formulary drug at the formulary cost if your provider establishes medical necessity and the medical necessity authorization request is approved.

• If you fill a prescription for a non-covered drug, you’ll pay the full cost of the drug.

Not sure which category your drug is in? You can search the TRICARE Formulary to check. (Keep in mind that the search tool won’t show next year’s copayments until Jan. 1.)

3. The type of pharmacy you use

Where you get your prescription also affects your costs.

TRICARE pharmacy costs (2026–2027)

See the new copayments (in bold) below.

Military pharmacies (up to a 90-day supply)

• You’ll pay nothing. (Call the pharmacy to confirm they carry your drug.)

Home delivery (up to a 90-day supply)

• Generic formulary drugs will increase from $13 to $14.

• Brand-name formulary drugs will increase from $38 to $44.

• Non-formulary drugs will increase from $76 to $85.

Retail network pharmacies (up to a 30-day supply)

• Generic formulary drugs will still be $16.

• Brand-name formulary drugs will increase from $43 to $48.

• Non-formulary drugs will increase from $76 to $85.

Non-network pharmacies (Up to a 30-day supply)

Your TRICARE health plan determines your non-network pharmacy costs in the U.S. and U.S. territories. (Note: Go to Pharmacy Costs to find cost-shares for overseas pharmacies.)

Do you have a TRICARE Prime plan? If so, your non-network pharmacy costs will stay the same. With a TRICARE Prime plan:

• You must meet your point-of-service deductible for covered drugs.

• You’ll pay a 50% cost-share for covered drugs after you meet this deductible.

Do you have another TRICARE plan? You’ll pay a copayment or cost-share after you meet your annual deductible. These costs are:

• Generic and brand-name formulary drugs will cost $48 (up from $43) or 20% of the total cost, whichever is more.

• Non-formulary drugs will cost $85 (up from $76) or 20% of the total cost, whichever is more.

Keep in mind that if you use a non-network pharmacy, you’ll have to pay full price for your drug up front. Then you can file a claim for reimbursement. Reimbursements are subject to applicable deductibles, cost-shares, and copayments.

Many veterans receive care through Veterans Affairs (VA), but veterans eligible for Medicare are sometimes confused if they should enroll. In fact, according to the VA, veterans 65 and older are encouraged to enroll in Medicare, even if they’re already using VA healthcare benefits.

Why? Because Medicare may be able to help when VA care isn’t available or practical. Furthermore, Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans provide access to a network of doctors, pharmacies, and hospitals—giving veterans more flexibility to see providers closer to home, avoid potentially long wait times, or get care when traveling. Even at VA-authorized facilities, Medicare Advantage plans may cover additional services, giving veterans more options and peace of mind.

During the Medicare Annual Election Period, which runs Oct. 15 through Dec. 7, those with Medicare can explore and enroll in Medicare Advantage plans that support their full health—physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Your plan will depend on your unique health needs, but key factors to consider include monthly premiums and the level of coverage provided, along with how a Medicare Advantage plan would work with your current VA or TRICARE coverage. Whether you’re managing chronic conditions, coping with depression or anxiety, managing PTSD, or navigating life transitions, you deserve care that supports your full health.

For example, the Humana USAA Honor Giveback plan and the Humana USAA Honor Giveback with Rx plan, while available to anyone eligible for Medicare, are designed with veterans in mind. They include a Part B giveback, a benefit that puts money back in the beneficiary’s Social Security check for the Part B premium, as well as a $0 monthly plan premium, $0 copay for in-network primary care visits, and dental, vision, and hearing coverage. New in 2026, every Humana USAA Honor Giveback plan features a $0 copay for in-network mental health services, including therapy and specialist visits, delivered virtually or in person.

These are the only Medicare Advantage plans developed in partnership with USAA, and anyone eligible for Medicare can enroll. That means your Medicare-eligible spouse can benefit from the same coverage.

“What makes this collaboration [between USAA and Humana] special is our shared commitment to the military community,” explained Mary Forey, USAA AVP of Health Solutions, in an interview with We Are The Mighty. “Humana brings deep healthcare experience, and USAA brings more than a century of trust earned by serving those who serve. Together, we’re focused on education and giving veterans straightforward, reliable information to help them make the right decisions for their personal health needs.”

Selecting health insurance doesn’t have to be confusing or intimidating.

“We want to help people with lifelong well-being, and veterans often have unique needs,” said Michael Jones, Broker Relations Manager with Humana and U.S. Army veteran, in an interview with We Are The Mighty. “My goal is to make sure veterans know they have options with their healthcare. For those who served in the military and did so honorably, especially for those looking for healthcare in their later years, we want to make sure that they are informed of their choices.”

USAA and Humana have collaborated to provide special training to Humana Customer Care Specialists to better understand the unique needs of veterans and military families—and they’re ready to help.

“Our focus is education, not sales,” Forey added. “We provide veterans with clear, factual information about how each program works and how they can complement one another. Our goal is always to empower veterans to make the decision that’s right for them.”

These professionals live and work in the communities they serve. They’ll walk you through the basics—like what Part A and Part B cover—and help you understand how Medicare Advantage plans can work when you also have VA benefits.

“I work with over 1,000 professionals [in my] area who know the basics of Medicare, get tested on it once a year, and help anyone eligible, including veterans and their spouses understand their options,” Jones added.

Supporting members, especially veterans, means looking beyond just physical health.

“We know that mental health is just as important as physical health—and both are deeply connected,” Forey said. “Through our Medicare Advantage plans, we provide access to mental health benefits with potentially shorter wait times compared to the traditional VA system. Serving our members means caring for the full person—not just their medical or financial needs but also prioritizing their mental and emotional well-being.”

You’ve earned the right to choose how you get your care. Medicare Advantage plans offer flexibility, support, and benefits that go beyond the basics. And with trusted professionals ready to guide you through the process, you won’t have to navigate it alone.

Not sure what you mean with ""...using Civilian Tricare vs retiree options""

Civilian (GS) employees also have TRICARE for their health insurance. I understand if you have other insurance then TRICARE is a secondary insurance, but does it make any sense to have it be Secondary to itself? Weird.

Government employees appear to still have health plans similar to Prime & Standard. Appreciate the correction below. Still trying to figure out what would be the optimal balance of coverage vs cost between TRICARE Standard, one of the Federal Employees Health Benefits programs, and Johns Hopkins Prime. Equiv.

Not sure you have to stay Prime for continuity of care, why not switch to Standard and keep the same doc?

As I understand it, I can't be on Standard and go to an MTF for treatment. Since I'm being seen by a specialist in the MTF right now, if I want to keep seeing them until this issue is resolved, I'll need to stay Prime.

MALVERN, Pa., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuronetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STIM), a medical technology company focused on designing, developing, and marketing products that improve the quality of life for patients who suffer from neurohealth disorders and the maker of NeuroStar® Advanced Therapy, announced that TriWest, the regional administrator for TRICARE, has updated its medical policy to include TMS coverage for adolescents aged 15 and older.

TRICARE coverage is primarily used by active and retired military service members and their eligible family members. This policy update, effective immediately, applies to TRICARE beneficiaries in the following states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

“TRICARE’s decision to expand coverage for TMS to adolescents is a significant step forward in ensuring that younger patients struggling with depression now have access to this life-changing treatment,” said Keith J. Sullivan, President and CEO of Neuronetics, Inc. “We applaud TRICARE and TriWest for recognizing the importance of providing innovative, evidence-based care to those who need it most, and we remain committed to working with providers and policymakers to expand adolescent access to TMS nationwide.”

""The demands of military life can create unique stressors for the children of service members, increasing their vulnerability to depression and other mental health challenges,” said Geoffrey Grammer, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Neuronetics and retired U.S. Army Colonel. “By expanding coverage to include NeuroStar TMS, TriWest is taking a meaningful step toward ensuring that the sons and daughters of our active-duty and retired military heroes receive the care and support that honors their families’ service to our nation.""

An estimated 4.3 million U.S. adolescents aged 15-21 are affected by major depression.1 Depression amongst adolescents can disrupt crucial aspects of development, such as academic performance, relationships with peers and family members, and overall emotional well-being. With limited approved medication options for adolescents with MDD, NeuroStar is a safe and effective option that can be used as a first-line, add-on treatment with remarkable clinical outcomes. As a first-line treatment, NeuroStar can be used without prior medication failures in this age group. Since receiving FDA clearance for adolescent patients in 2024, NeuroStar TMS therapy is also now covered by several leading insurers, including but not limited to: Evernorth Health Services (a Cigna company), BlueCross BlueShield Health Care Service Corporation (BCBS-HCSC), Humana, Aetna, Medi-Cal, Pacific Source, and more.

In addition to being the first TMS company with FDA clearance for adolescent treatment, Neuronetics is the only TMS company in the industry with a dedicated health policy team that partners with both providers and payors to advocate for health policy updates.

The control group patients will receive the current standard of care for nerve repair, while the intervention group patients will receive standard of care with addition of NervAlign applied to the repaired nerve.

Each cohort will enrol about 120 patients with primary endpoints focusing on changes in pre- and post-operative pain scores, as well as functional recovery metrics.

Secondary endpoints include assessments of patient quality of life and surgical site outcomes.

‘Major progress in ReNerve’s mission’

CEO Dr Julian Chick said: “This approval represents major progress in our mission to provide superior nerve repair solutions to those who need them most.

""Military service members and veterans often face complex peripheral nerve injuries, and we are honoured and proud that the NervAlign Nerve Cuff will now be available to support their recovery and rehabilitation.”

By knowing your options and the various programs that can extend your TRICARE or equivalent coverage once you leave service, you can reduce the headache of ensuring you retain low-cost medical coverage while transitioning to civilian life.

Keep reading to learn more about health insurance options for active-duty military members and veterans.

What Type of Insurance Is Provided for Active Military Members?

Active-duty military members have access to TRICARE, a series of health insurance programs operated by the U.S. Department of Defense. TRICARE uses a combination of military hospitals and clinics alongside civilian networks of authorized providers, which can vary by location.[1]

While there are multiple TRICARE plans, active-duty military members must enroll in TRICARE Prime or one of its remote or overseas options, depending on their location and proximity to a military hospital or clinic. While some TRICARE plans may have costs, TRICARE Prime has no out-of-pocket expenses, enrollment fees, point-of-service fees or copayments for active-duty members.[2] Civilian dental care is also covered for active-duty service members.[3]

Service members may also be eligible for Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI), which offers low-cost term life insurance coverage. Eligible individuals can receive coverage up to $500,000 in $50,000 increments. Currently, the premium rate is $0.05 per $1,000 of coverage, plus $1 for Traumatic Injury Protection, regardless of the coverage amount.[4]

SGLI coverage extends up to 120 days after leaving military service for most members, while those who are totally disabled can extend coverage for up to two years after separation.[4]

Additionally, reserve members who don’t normally qualify for full-time SGLI coverage can enroll in part-time coverage.[4]

Are VA Benefits the Same as TRICARE?

While there is significant overlap between VA health benefits and those offered by TRICARE — including outpatient, inpatient and preventive services — they are not identical.[5] In general, TRICARE uses a combination of military and civilian hospitals and clinics, whereas VA benefits are typically limited to VA-run facilities. In some cases, VA beneficiaries may be eligible to seek community care from an outside facility depending on their location and the medical service required.[6][7]

Costs may also differ between VA-covered services and TRICARE. For example, TRICARE Prime has no fees or copayments for medical services, but those with VA benefits may need to pay a copayment for some care. However, services related to a service-connected injury or illness may be fully covered under VA benefits.[8]

What Happens to My Health Insurance After Retiring From Active Duty?

After you retire from active service, you’ll lose your existing TRICARE coverage and will need to enroll in a new health care plan.[9] We’ll discuss some options available to retiring military members for continuing their health insurance coverage later.

Am I Still Eligible for TRICARE After I Retire From the Military?

You’ll still be eligible for coverage through a TRICARE plan after retiring from the military, provided you remain eligible and follow the enrollment process. You must enroll in a qualifying TRICARE plan within 90 days of retiring. If you fail to do so, you may still have the option to request retroactive enrollment for up to 12 months following your retirement date. However, doing so will require you to pay any enrollment fees.[10]

If you do not enroll by the end of your retroactive enrollment period, you can still enroll in a TRICARE plan but must wait until you experience a qualifying life event or TRICARE Open Season, which is similar to the Open Enrollment Period for traditional health care coverage. TRICARE Open Season runs from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9 as of 2025. If you fail to reestablish your TRICARE coverage, you may still receive medical services at military hospitals or clinics if space is available.[10][11]

Health Insurance Options After Your Military Enlistment Ends

Below, we’ll cover some health insurance options available to military service members after they leave the service, whether through retirement or separation.

TRICARE for Retired Military Members

Retired military service members are still eligible for TRICARE, provided they enroll within the timeframe after their retirement. However, after retirement, TRICARE members must pay for certain care costs and may lose access to services they received while covered under TRICARE as active-duty service members, such as those through the Extended Care Health Option.[10]

You’ll likely qualify for TRICARE for Life, a Medicare wraparound available for those eligible for TRICARE who also qualify for Medicare and pay for Part B. Enrollment is automatic for those who qualify, and it splits payments between Medicare and TRICARE coverage, helping to reduce out-of-pocket medical costs.[12]

Keep in mind that TRICARE after you leave active duty is only available for those who retire. If you separate before your retirement date, you may lose eligibility for a TRICARE health plan.[13][14]

Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP)

Those who separate from active military service before retirement will lose TRICARE coverage, but can enroll in the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP) to help them retain health care benefits for up to 180 days after their TRICARE benefits end — generally right before midnight on their last day of duty.[13][15]

TAMP is designed to help those separating from service, or qualifying for other eligible reasons, transition into a civilian health plan. Additionally, TAMP doesn’t require any premium payments and functions similarly to TRICARE health plans for its duration.[15]

Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP)

If you’ve separated from military service, you may also have the option to enroll in the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP). CHCBP coverage is available for 18 months following either the end of your TRICARE coverage or the end of TAMP coverage.[16]

This health insurance program provides minimum essential coverage as defined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and is premium-based, so you’ll need to pay a monthly premium of around $616.33. Coverage is otherwise identical to TRICARE Select, including prescription benefits, and works similarly to a PPO. This means you’ll likely need to pay a copay and cost-sharing percentage for each doctor visit.[17][18]

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)

Veterans Affairs (VA) health benefits are available to eligible service members, including those who are no longer on active duty. These benefits cover preventive care, inpatient hospital services, urgent and emergency care, and other services, such as mental health care. VA health benefits are typically provided at VA facilities, but exceptions can be made for community care depending on the service needed and the location of the nearest VA facility.[5][6][19]

To be eligible for VA health benefits, you must have served for 24 consecutive months or have been discharged for a disability caused or worsened by active-duty service. Those discharged for hardship or who served before Sep. 7, 1980, also qualify for VA health benefits. Individuals who received an other-than-honorable discharge are generally excluded from VA coverage, but eligibility may be determined on a case-by-case basis by the VA.[19][20]

While there is no enrollment fee or premium cost for VA health coverage, you may need to pay a copay based on your priority group, income and whether you have a service-connected disability.[21]

Health Insurance Marketplace

You can enroll in health insurance through a Marketplace Health Plan. Losing your TRICARE coverage, either through retirement or separation, will typically qualify as a special enrollment period, allowing you to enroll in a plan outside of the traditional Open Enrollment Period. Try to shop around and get quotes from three to five different insurance companies to compare benefits and premium costs.

Insurance Through Your or Your Spouse's Employer

If your employer offers health insurance, or you qualify for coverage through your spouse's employer, you might be able to enroll in coverage that way. Be sure to check if there are any cost increases when enrolling in your spouse’s health care coverage, as higher monthly payments could make other options more cost-effective.

TRICARE open season runs from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9 and applies to the coverage available to AGRs and retirees over age 60. Learn more.

Dual-Status Technicians

Although dual-status technicians must be drilling Guardsmen to qualify for their positions, they are considered civilian federal workers and must currently obtain their health care through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program.

FEHB changes must be made during the federal benefits open season from Nov. 10 to Dec. 8. Learn more.

Active Guard Reserve

Title 32 AGRs may also enroll in a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account and use pre-tax dollars to pay for programs like preschool, summer day camp and child or adult daycare.

DCFSA enrollment is part of the federal benefits open season. More information isavailable here.

All AGRs will additionally be eligible for a new Defense Department Health Care Flexible Spending Account.

Most drilling Guardsmen and retirees under age 60 (gray-area retirees) are eligible for TRICARE Reserve Select or TRICARE Retired Reserve. Enrollment in both premium-based programs is available at any time.

TRICARE Rate Changes for 2016

Current TRS monthly premiums are $53.80 for service members and $274.48 for a service member and their family. These monthly premiums will increase to $57.88 for service members and $286.66 for a service member and their family in 2026.

Monthly TRR premiums are $631.26 for individual coverage and $1,513.04 for a family. These premiums will increase to $645.90 for an individual and $1,548.30 for a family.

TRS premiums are largely subsidized to bolster medical readiness; TRR is sold at cost to DoD.

Retired Guardsmen over age 60 are eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Open season does not apply to those with TRICARE For Life coverage, which is automatic for those with Medicare Part A and Part B.

I've never had an issue in any area we've PCS'd to until we moved this past summer. I am currently pregnant and seeing several specialists for pregnancy-related issues. I have required 3 referrals in the past week alone, but realized that the large hospital network that I am a patient of has absolutely no clue how to process Tricare referrals, which is weird because they accept Tricare. I had a doctor send up two referrals to specialists last week, but fail to send these referrals through Tricare's portal. I was told by Tricare that if I attended these appointments, I could be on the hook to pay out of pocket for them because no referral existed in their system though a referral existed in the hospital's system. These services are otherwise covered 100% with a proper referral.

Make sure your civilian PCP and doctors know how to process Tricare referrals. If you have Tricare East like I do, download the Humana Military app and check that referrals are processed in the app before going to your appointment or getting your procedures done. I learned from Tricare that this is an ongoing issue with several Healthcare institutions and it has caused Tricare to deny claims that would have otherwise been approved. Just a PSA.

MALVERN, Pa., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuronetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STIM), a medical technology company focused on designing, developing, and marketing products that improve the quality of life for patients who suffer from neurohealth disorders and the maker of NeuroStar® Advanced Therapy, announced that TriWest, the regional administrator for TRICARE, has updated its medical policy to include TMS coverage for adolescents aged 15 and older.

TRICARE coverage is primarily used by active and retired military service members and their eligible family members. This policy update, effective immediately, applies to TRICARE beneficiaries in the following states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

“TRICARE’s decision to expand coverage for TMS to adolescents is a significant step forward in ensuring that younger patients struggling with depression now have access to this life-changing treatment,” said Keith J. Sullivan, President and CEO of Neuronetics, Inc. “We applaud TRICARE and TriWest for recognizing the importance of providing innovative, evidence-based care to those who need it most, and we remain committed to working with providers and policymakers to expand adolescent access to TMS nationwide.”

""The demands of military life can create unique stressors for the children of service members, increasing their vulnerability to depression and other mental health challenges,” said Geoffrey Grammer, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Neuronetics and retired U.S. Army Colonel. “By expanding coverage to include NeuroStar TMS, TriWest is taking a meaningful step toward ensuring that the sons and daughters of our active-duty and retired military heroes receive the care and support that honors their families’ service to our nation.""

An estimated 4.3 million U.S. adolescents aged 15-21 are affected by major depression.1 Depression amongst adolescents can disrupt crucial aspects of development, such as academic performance, relationships with peers and family members, and overall emotional well-being. With limited approved medication options for adolescents with MDD, NeuroStar is a safe and effective option that can be used as a first-line, add-on treatment with remarkable clinical outcomes. As a first-line treatment, NeuroStar can be used without prior medication failures in this age group. Since receiving FDA clearance for adolescent patients in 2024, NeuroStar TMS therapy is also now covered by several leading insurers, including but not limited to: Evernorth Health Services (a Cigna company), BlueCross BlueShield Health Care Service Corporation (BCBS-HCSC), Humana, Aetna, Medi-Cal, Pacific Source, and more.

In addition to being the first TMS company with FDA clearance for adolescent treatment, Neuronetics is the only TMS company in the industry with a dedicated health policy team that partners with both providers and payors to advocate for health policy updates.

The national association, which represents nearly 19,000 independent pharmacies across the country, has been active in Arkansas and other states supporting and defending laws that protect patient access to the pharmacies of their choice.
“The Arkansas law is a model for the country,” CEO B. Douglas Hoey said.
“Vertical integration has allowed a handful of giant corporations to control patients and create massive disadvantages for their competition.
They deny patients the ability to choose their own health care providers, and they put a lot of small, independent pharmacies out of business, creating pharmacy deserts.","“The law protects patients by simply saying a business can either be a licensed PBM or a licensed pharmacy -- but not both,” said John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association. “PBMs are forcing our most vulnerable Arkansans -- including those battling cancer -- to use pharmacies owned by or affiliated with the PBMs, and in many cases forcing them to overpay with massive markups for the medications they depend on. This blatant conflict of interest leads to dangerous delays in treatment that threaten patients’ health and safety.”

Express Scripts’ complaint said the law “imperils the health” of the 50,000 Arkansans it serves, including members of the military, their families and veterans, because the PBM is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.

Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law.

The national association, which represents nearly 19,000 independent pharmacies across the country, has been active in Arkansas and other states supporting and defending laws that protect patient access to the pharmacies of their choice.

Douglas Hoey said. “Vertical integration has allowed a handful of giant corporations to control patients and create massive disadvantages for their competition. They deny patients the ability to choose their own health care providers, and they put a lot of small, independent pharmacies out of business, creating pharmacy deserts. The Arkansas law eliminates the obvious conflict of interest at the heart of the problem.”

The Arkansas Insurance Department received thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid below, at or just above the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, independent pharmacists and the department’s general counsel told state lawmakers, according to the Arkansas Advocate.",https://k2-prod-alm.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/brightspot/a2/fb/72ab437f4d9d9463de0107e72fc2/2024-11-12-pills-alm-640x640-allison-bell.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-13 00:56:43.784069

The deal could redefine BigBear.ai’s position in the secure AI infrastructure market by combining its mission-focused expertise with Ask Sage’s agentic AI and multi-model orchestration capabilities.

Ask Sage already supports more than 100,000 users across 16,000 U.S. government teams, including the Defense Health Agency, U.S. Space Force and Office of the Secretary of Defense. The platform’s FedRAMP High accreditation and cloud-agnostic design enable it to deploy more than 150 frontier and open-source models securely across classified environments — a competitive edge that could help BigBear.ai capture accelerating federal AI spending.

The acquisition also provides a substantial cross-selling opportunity. BigBear.ai can integrate its ConductorOS and VeriScan solutions into Ask Sage’s ecosystem, expanding its footprint across defense, intelligence and travel security customers. Meanwhile, Ask Sage’s projected sixfold ARR growth to $25 million in 2025 underscores its commercial viability.

With $715 million in cash and investments and a robust $376 million backlog, BigBear.ai enters this integration from a position of strength. Execution risks remain, but the move signals a pivot toward platform-level AI leadership. If successfully integrated, Ask Sage could turn BigBear.ai into a leading generative AI enabler for secure, mission-critical operations — positioning it for accelerated growth through 2026 and beyond.

BBAI Battles Established Players in National Security AI

BigBear.ai operates in a rapidly intensifying defense and intelligence AI market, competing with diversified players like Leidos Holdings LDOS and Science Applications International Corp. SAIC. Both Leidos and SAIC have deep federal footprints and long-standing ties with the Department of Defense, giving them scale and stability that BigBear.ai is working to match through its Ask Sage acquisition.

Leidos continues to expand its AI-driven mission systems, data fusion, and cyber analytics capabilities, aligning with the Pentagon’s push for real-time decision intelligence — an area where BigBear.ai seeks to differentiate through agile agentic AI integration. Meanwhile, SAIC is enhancing its machine learning and digital engineering offerings, building secure AI pipelines for national security and space operations.

As Leidos and SAIC intensify investments in secure automation and cloud-edge interoperability, BigBear.ai’s Ask Sage integration could provide the speed and modularity needed to compete head-on with these larger incumbents.

Investors seeking deeper insights into STIM’s financial health and growth prospects can access comprehensive analysis through InvestingPro’s detailed Research Reports, available for over 1,400 US equities.

In other recent news, Neuronetics reported a third-quarter 2025 revenue of $37.3 million, marking an 11% increase compared to the same period last year. The company’s Greenbrook clinics contributed significantly to this growth, generating $21.8 million in revenue, which is a 25% increase from the previous year. Additionally, Neuronetics entered into an exclusive three-year agreement with Elite DNA Behavioral Health to supply transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) devices across more than 30 locations in Florida. This partnership will utilize Neuronetics’ Greenbrook platform to enhance operational and patient support services. Another development for Neuronetics is that New York Medicaid will start covering TMS therapy for major depressive disorder, potentially expanding the company’s reach to over 5 million Medicaid members. Meanwhile, Stifel raised its price target for SiTime Corporation to $324 from $240, maintaining a Buy rating. This adjustment follows SiTime’s launch of its Titan Platform, which positions the company uniquely in the $4 billion resonator market. These recent developments highlight significant growth and strategic partnerships for both Neuronetics and SiTime.

The coverage expansion applies to Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

An estimated 4.3 million U.S. adolescents aged 15-21 are affected by major depression, which can disrupt academic performance, relationships, and emotional well-being.

Several other insurers have also added coverage for adolescent TMS therapy, including Evernorth Health Services (a Cigna company), BlueCross BlueShield Health Care Service Corporation, Humana, Aetna, and Medi-Cal.While Neuronetics reported impressive revenue growth of 78.6% in the last twelve months, analysts expect continued sales growth this year. Investors seeking deeper insights into STIM’s financial health and growth prospects can access comprehensive analysis through InvestingPro’s detailed Research Reports, available for over 1,400 US equities.

In other recent news, Neuronetics reported a third-quarter 2025 revenue of $37.3 million, marking an 11% increase compared to the same period last year. The company’s Greenbrook clinics contributed significantly to this growth, generating $21.8 million in revenue, which is a 25% increase from the previous year. Additionally, Neuronetics entered into an exclusive three-year agreement with Elite DNA Behavioral Health to supply transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) devices across more than 30 locations in Florida. This partnership will utilize Neuronetics’ Greenbrook platform to enhance operational and patient support services. Another development for Neuronetics is that New York Medicaid will start covering TMS therapy for major depressive disorder, potentially expanding the company’s reach to over 5 million Medicaid members. Meanwhile, Stifel raised its price target for SiTime Corporation to $324 from $240, maintaining a Buy rating. This adjustment follows SiTime’s launch of its Titan Platform, which positions the company uniquely in the $4 billion resonator market. These recent developments highlight significant growth and strategic partnerships for both Neuronetics and SiTime.

Military families in Atlanta and Tampa will see something different during the 2025 TRICARE Open Season: a new choice in how they receive care.

Through the Department of Defense’s Competitive Plans Demonstration (CPD), eligible families can enroll in TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV), a health plan designed to meet the realities of military life with more local support.

TRICARE remains a critical part of military readiness, and this system is continuing to evolve. Roving choice ensures families have access, continuity, and the kind of support that fits their lives.

According to the Blue Star Families 2023 Military Family Lifestyle Survey, 35 percent of active duty family respondents live in communities with a shortage of both military and civilian mental health professionals. These gaps can delay care when families need it most, and the stress shows in every area of life, from parenting to readiness.

Military families move the mission. They adapt, restart, and keep the home front running so their loved ones can serve. In health care, as in service, demands evolve quickly. While TRICARE continues to support millions of families, military life today requires new approaches to access, continuity, and support. That is why the Department of Defense launched the Competitive Plans Demonstration to explore options that better reflect the pace and complexity of modern military service.

This is something I understand not just professionally but personally. As the spouse and daughter of veterans, a military family member and advocate, I have watched families rebuild care after a move. TRICARE provides essential coverage to millions of beneficiaries. Initiatives like the CPD are vital for building on what works and expanding access through new options.

At CareSource Military & Veterans, our teams include veterans, military spouses, and caregivers who know the routine. This lived experience has shaped our approach, offering real-time support, expanded access to behavioral health, and providers who understand what service-connected care means.

We are also focused on education. Many families do not know that CareSource Military & Veterans is an option under the CPD. Our mission is to make the path clear.

It is about collaboration, listening to families, and continuing to build systems that serve both readiness and well-being.

Military families serve too. And they deserve a health care experience that reflects their commitment, not just in theory but in practice, access, and follow-through.

Military families need a health plan that offers reliable access to care, understands their unique experiences, and helps them navigate the responsibilities of military life. That is what the CPD aims to provide.

If you’re part of the military community or a veteran, you probably already know TRICARE helps cover your healthcare costs. But have you ever scratched your head wondering, “Where on earth is my TRICARE policy number?” It’s one of those little details that suddenly becomes super important when you’re trying to access benefits or file a claim.

Let’s face it: whenever you go to see a new provider or need to get paperwork sorted, showing your TRICARE policy number is often required. Whether you’re:

Registering for care with a healthcare provider

Filing a claim for reimbursement

Verifying your coverage status

Renewing or updating your health coverage

Knowing exactly where to find that number can save you a ton of stress and time. The good news? It’s usually not buried too deep if you know where to look.

Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your TRICARE Policy Number Online

Here’s a straightforward approach to track down your TRICARE policy number by logging into trusted resources online–perfect if you don’t have your physical ID card handy or need to double-check your info.

1. Access the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)

Most TRICARE information is tied to your DEERS profile. This is where military eligibility and insurance details are stored. If you haven’t set up your account yet, it’s worth doing so at MilConnect.

2. Log In Using Your CAC or DS Logon

Once on MilConnect, you’ll sign in either with your Common Access Card (CAC) or DS Logon credentials. These secure logins protect your sensitive info, so keep your details close.

3. Navigate to the ‘Show Proof of Coverage’ Section

Inside your MilConnect account, look for options like ‘View/Renew Coverage’ or ‘Proof of TRICARE Coverage.’ This section provides official documentation, including your policy number, which acts as your coverage identifier.

4. Check Your TRICARE ID Card

Often, the TRICARE policy number is printed right on your ID card—sometimes called the sponsor’s identification number. If you have the card but aren’t sure where to look, it’s commonly near the top or under the sponsor’s name.

5. Contact TRICARE Support If Needed

If online routes aren’t helping out, calling TRICARE customer service can be the way to go. They can confirm your policy number and explain how to retrieve it securely.

This video walks you through how to find TRICARE providers and, implicitly, the info you’ll likely need on hand—like your policy number—when scheduling appointments. It’s a handy visual if you’re more of a follow-along learner.

Top Mistakes to Avoid When Searching for Your TRICARE Information

Assuming Your Policy Number is the Same as Your Social Security Number: TRICARE explicitly avoids using SSNs on cards or documentation to protect privacy. Trying to use your SSN will just lead to confusion and potential denial of claims.

Overlooking the DEERS Database: Many don’t realize that if your DEERS info isn’t current, your TRICARE policy number – and thus coverage – might not be recognized correctly. Always keep your DEERS profile up to date.

Relying Solely on Paper Cards: Lost or outdated physical cards can mislead you. Using the online MilConnect portal usually provides the most current and accurate numbers.

Sharing Personal Details Over Unofficial Channels: Stay alert against scammers. TRICARE does not request your policy number through random phone calls or emails, so double-check who you’re talking with.

Expert Tips for Keeping Your TRICARE Documents Organized and Accessible

Managing healthcare info can feel like juggling flaming torches, especially when claims deadlines loom. Here’s some advice from people who’ve lived through it and won’t let the chaos get them twice.

Use a Dedicated Folder (Physical or Digital): Keep all TRICARE-related documents, including your ID card, statements, and correspondence, in one spot. Apps like Evernote or Google Drive make digital archiving effortless and accessible anywhere.

Set Calendar Reminders: Mark dates for renewing coverage or submitting claims. It’s easy to let these slip, causing unnecessary stress.

Update Your DEERS Info Promptly: A quick check-in every six months can prevent surprises when benefits don’t go through as expected.

Share Essential Info Securely: When family members or caregivers need access, use password-protected shares or direct them to official sites with instructions.

According to official TRICARE resources, keeping your proof of coverage accessible can significantly speed up claims processes, reducing waiting time and headaches.

How to Use Your TRICARE Policy Number for Benefits and Claims

Once you’ve got your policy number, knowing exactly how to use it is just as important. It acts as your key to getting the healthcare services you’re entitled to and making sure providers get paid without hassle.

Booking Appointments with TRICARE Providers

This number confirms your enrollment and eligibility when you call to schedule an appointment. Some providers may ask for it upfront before even booking, so have it handy.

Submitting Claims

If you get care outside the network, filing a claim manually usually requires including your TRICARE policy number. It identifies the coverage applying to that specific treatment or consultation.

Verifying Eligibility

When switching plans or updating dependents, your policy number verifies that you or your family members meet TRICARE requirements. It’s a quick way to prevent denials based on missing or mismatched data.

Renewals and Updates

Your policy number is often needed to renew your benefits or update any personal info that could affect your coverage.

Visual Guide: Navigating TRICARE’s Website to Retrieve Your Policy Number

If you’re a visual learner, a little guided tour can make this all click. Here’s a layout to help you sail online with confidence.

Start by logging into your account at MilConnect, then look for eligibility or coverage tabs. Your policy number is usually displayed alongside other vital details like sponsor name, plan type, and effective dates.

Additional Handy Tip

Besides the official channels, sometimes your healthcare provider’s billing department can help verify your TRICARE policy number if you’re stuck.

Eric Flores is a Board Member for the Northeast Indiana Base Community Council. He

“If they have Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance or TriCare, those policies cannot lapse. The premiums are paid on their behalf and as soon as they go back to duty and get that first paycheck, they would have a debt to the government. It’s like digging yourself out of the hole.”

One lump sum, “taxed at a higher rate the net pay is probably not going to cover the hole that they’re in. Besides a missed payment, you’re looking at late fees and delinquencies. It will definitely trickle down.”

The NIBCC gives one time grants to servicemembers up to $800. Flores said over the past few years, an increasing amount of grants have been given out, starting out with $14,000 in 2021, rising to $63,351 in 2024. So far this year, the NIBCC has distributed $73,975, the bulk of which was given during the government shutdown.

Since October 15, the NIBCC has approved all 60 grant requests, a rate that Flores said is unsustainable for the agency.

“We’ve raised about $100,000 between two of our events, in the last three weeks we probably awarded $50,000 in grants. At this rate, we are likely to run out of the funds we’ve raised.”

Flores said he expects requests to keep coming.

“There may be an end in sight; it’s not a matter of disapproving or approving of the government shutdown, that’s our elected officials’ problem. In addition to the current need, eventually it’s just going to trickle down. There’s going to be late fees, there’s going to be delinquency fees, there’s also going to be our holidays, where we always see more grant requests coming through.”

Have a reserve account but he’s hoping other people will see the need for servicemembers

“It’s not as isolated as this shutdown, there’s a lot that our servicemembers endure, two different sets of orders

“We know many of our people in the United States work paycheck to paycheck. One missed paycheck really does have an impact.”

So yes, the military members try to access care on the outside.
There’s legislation in the House from Rep. Sarah Jacobs that is aiming to increase access for military families to this treatment.","Terry Gerton Welcome back to this special Veterans Day edition: The best of the Federal Drive with Terry Gerton on Federal News Network. The White House is working to lower the cost of IVF, putting fertility care in the spotlight. But military families often face extra hurdles when trying to start a family, whether it’s deployments, relocations, or the demands of service. New legislation aims to close that gap. To help us understand the medical side of this issue, Federal News Network’s Eric spoke with Dr. Michael Wittenberger, a reproductive endocrinologist and Navy veteran who spent years treating veterans and their families.

Eric White So obviously, they’re not the only ones that can struggle with infertility, but what is it in particular about military families, where they have even more of an issue getting treatment for it? What are some of the roadblocks of the jobs that they entail that kind of getting in the way? What is what is that you have seen?

Michael Wittenberger The military by its nature is just a different organization completely than what most people are. The military mission takes precedence, and so the military mission often will require that service members are separated from their families. That can be while they are watch-standing, it can be on workups, it can be on deployment. So there’s frequent separations between the partners that are trying to get pregnant. And so using different surveys, there seems to be an increase in the difficulty for military family members in planning and executing a family. And when you look at the prevalence of infertility in the military, it seems like it’s higher than the civilian population. So in addition to these frequent interruptions and the continuity between partners, there’s a number of other things that are inherent to just the military. There’s different jobs that you have, and there’s different expectations for different duty assignment. It’s expected while you’re on sea duty that you don’t try to get pregnant because you’re expected to deploy even though you may be in port and you may not be deployable at that moment. At the time that you’re there, you’re expected not to get pregnant. The other half is okay to get pregnant, but again, there’s other things like access to care. When I retired in 2022, I was one of three active-duty reproductive endocrinologists and infertility specialists in the entire Navy. That’s serving, you know, the approximately 500,000 active-duty Navy and Marines on both coasts and around the world. So you can imagine when there’s just a couple or three specialists that there’s going to be bottlenecks in care. And a lot of times the sailors, the marines, the service members are going to located remotely so there’s not going to a local catchment where they can be seen and taken care of. So another barrier to care is really just a delay in diagnosis for many of them for getting the care, they’ll be out in an area they can’t access care, so they have to wait to come back to a military training facility that actually has a reproductive endocrinologist to try to get access to care. So, you know, a lot of different barriers potentially to care for the military family.

Eric White I guess we can start with your interaction with these patients. Was that a frustration that you heard a lot in treating service members, you know, “it took me two months to get this appointment”? Did some of them seek help outside of their respective military branch?

Michael Wittenberger I would say that’s always been a concern of people trying to access care, is that the delay to get in and see a specialist is hard or that they need to go out and see fertility specialist in the civilian world. The problem with that is that in both cases, TRICARE, they completely covered the diagnostics of trying to diagnose you with infertility, but the treatment options are very limited with TRICARE for active duty. They consist basically of any treatment option that uses coitus as a form of conception. So that means anything with artificial insemination, IVF, fertility preservation in many cases is not covered by TRICARE. So yes, the military members try to access care on the outside. And they find out that they have to cover the bill, and so that’s a huge financial burden for them. Even within the military, there’s a thought that if they can get care at the military treatment facility with a reproductive endocrinologist as active duty, that it’ll be covered. Well, that’s only partially true. So TRICARE has an exception to the lack of coverage that allows them to, for graduate medical education purposes, provide some additional care, like artificial insemination and the monitoring for IVF, the medications for IVF. So it does slightly reduce the cost of IVF, but since there’s no embryology team in any of the military services, there’s still a lot of expenses that the patient needs to contract with the civilian embryology lab or IVF center to actually cover.

Eric White And so let’s finish up here with some of the solutions that have been proposed and other ones that you think could be implemented. There’s legislation in the House from Rep. Sarah Jacobs that is aiming to increase access for military families to this treatment. What do you know about that? And what else could be done to make this an easier process for those that are looking to serve their country, but also want to fulfill their familial wishes?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Military-Family-Advisory-Network.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-11-11 16:01:02.081521

Yesterday, on Monday, Nov. 10, 17 transgender servicemembers, each with 15–18 years of service in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force filed a lawsuit, Ireland v. United States, against the Trump administration in the Federal Court of Claims for taking away the retirement money they earned, and which had been previously granted to them by the Secretary of the Air Force.

Each of these families faces a potential loss of up to $1–2 million over the course of their lifetimes. GLAD Law’s Attorney Michael Haley spoke to that “senseless and shocking affront” to our troops in a statement release: “These brave transgender servicemembers deserve the retirement benefits they have earned and that the Air Force granted them. As a country, we must honor our word to them, not rip away their benefits.”

Beyond the loss of retirement funds, lifetime access to TRICARE health insurance was rescinded, which would have allowed them to receive healthcare from civilian or non-VA medical facilities.

Back in June, the Air Force had issued retirement orders to transgender Airmen plaintiffs in this case. Two months later, the Air Force backed out of its retirement promise. Airmen were informed that they must be separated from the military without retirement under the new transgender military ban, instituted by Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News Host who was named head of the Defense Department (now Department of War), under the Trump Administration.

The stage was set earlier in the year, when Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order, signed on Air Force One, aimed at banning transgender service members within the U.S. military. The EO stated that “expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.”

“I raised my hand and served my country honorably for 15 years, including a deployment to Afghanistan,” said Master Sergeant Logan Ireland, the lead plaintiff in the current lawsuit. “Ripping away the retirements we have earned is a betrayal of the sacrifices made by servicemembers and our families. We should not be thrown into economic hardship or made to feel our years of service are regarded by our country as meaningless.”

Plaintiffs in this case are represented by the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, GLAD Law, and pro-bono counsel from Stapleton Segal Cochran LLC and The Law Office of Jeremy Spiegel.

Groups Recover Together (US, value-based addiction care): CEO Cooper Zelnick highlights a model combining evidence-based medicine, group therapy, and wraparound services, showing reduced relapse, overdose, and mortality, along with lower emergency room/inpatient use and criminal justice recidivism.

Medicaid and veteran care: Zelnick urges shifting from fee-for-service to outcome-based reimbursement, using 6-month treatment retention as a benchmark of clinical success; emphasizes rapid access, weekly community engagement, and abstinence as key metrics.

Policy implications: Warns that restricting Medicaid or Affordable Care Act (ACA) access could endanger patients with substance use disorder; calls for integration between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and community providers and incentives for TRICARE/Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS participation to expand veteran care access.

Please introduce yourself by stating your name, title, and any relevant experience you’d like to share.

Cooper Zelnick: I'm Cooper Zelnik. I'm the CEO of Groups Recover Together. We are the nation's largest value-based provider of addiction treatment. Fundamentally, the way I describe our work is, we serve folks who are struggling with addiction using a unique model that includes evidence-based medicine but also community, group therapy, and wraparound services. That model drives powerful clinical outcomes for the folks we serve, reducing relapses, overdoses, and mortality.

Those clinical outcomes translate into cost outcomes for our health plan and state partners, including reductions in total cost, reductions in recidivism and return to custody rates in the criminal justice setting, and reductions in emergency room and inpatient utilization. We help reduce health care spend by helping people get healthy.

What does it mean to “reward recovery” in Medicaid, and how would you measure real success for veterans in treatment for substance abuse?

Zelnick: It's worth noting that, historically, our health care system has not paid for outcomes. Specifically, in behavioral health and substance use disorder treatment, reimbursement and payments have been tied to the delivery of services, not to the achievement of outcomes or milestones.

For us, rewarding recovery is two things. The first thing is that we have to agree on what success looks like. The second thing is that we have to compensate for success to incentivize more of that success. What does success look like?

The easy answer is, success looks like retention in treatment at 6 months. It's the key benchmark of clinical efficacy in our industry. If a provider can retain a patient in outpatient care for 6 months, then it is less likely that that person will relapse, less likely that they'll overdose, less likely that they will die from this disease, and cost goes down. When we think about rewarding success, that's the easiest place.

It's not the whole story. Rapid access to care really matters. Weekly engagement with a supportive community really matters. Abstinence from illicit substances really matters. What we believe is that we should affect a switch in this country from paying for delivering services to paying for delivering outcomes.

How could value-based payment models change the way care is delivered to veterans struggling with substance use disorder?

Zelnick: Care is delivered based upon what is reimbursed. The things that are reimbursed off a traditional Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) fee schedule, which is driving how most veterans receive care, are individual appointments with a doctor, drug screening, and drug testing. Those activities are not the activities that most promote recovery. The activities that most promote recovery are therapy, peer interactions, care coordination, and activities that foster and build community.

Value-based payment models that align around outcomes and incentivize services that help people achieve those outcomes are the way that I would recommend transforming payment systems around addiction and recovery.

What are the biggest barriers that keep veterans from getting consistent care between the VA and community-based programs?

Zelnick: The VA does an amazing job. Many veterans rely upon the VA for any number of services, including addiction treatment services. The folks who work at VA hospitals across the country are dedicated, committed, passionate, and amazing.

It is also the case that, at many VA hospitals, there are wait lists for services. There are moments where veterans are unable to access care through the VA and need to go to community providers. That interaction is challenging. Community providers could probably do a better job of integrating with local VA hospitals. In certain cases, the same is true in the opposite direction. Building a more integrated system of care helps to eliminate a barrier.

It's been our experience that many local community providers don't contract with TRICARE, aren't Medicare enrolled, and, as a result, actually aren't contracted or empowered to serve this population. We work with TRICARE, we work with CMS, and we are really passionate about that work. It's super important to us. We're really proud of it and we do it everywhere. But it's challenging. There are documentation requirements, enrollment requirements, and contracting requirements.

I actually don't know whether it's possible to reduce those barriers, but I think incentivizing providers to serve that population would be really valuable as a way of expanding access to care.

If Congress moves forward with major health care reform, what changes would make the biggest difference for veterans’ recovery outcomes?

Zelnick: The two big proposed health care changes are the potential expiration of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies and the significant constriction of Medicaid. That's not the intent. The intent is to include work requirements, but, as a practical matter, there will be a greater number of folks who cannot access ACA marketplace insurance and a greater number of folks who will no longer be Medicaid eligible.

The big thing that would make a difference is being thoughtful about maintaining access, specifically for folks struggling with active substance use disorder. If they lose insurance, those patients are at high risk. If they lose access to care, they are super vulnerable and costly to our system. It is the right investment to make, to preserve access to health insurance and access to health care services for those who are struggling with substance use disorders. Anything we can do as a society to help those folks keep access to care, keep access to insurance, and keep getting the lifesaving medications and services they need is the right answer.

It's one of my favorite things about TriCare... the staff does a great job at triage and quickly handles authorization for emergency/urgent care. I call them all the time!

Also, don't be afraid to reach out to your provider via MHS Genesis' messaging (https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/app/login). I've gotten a shocking amount of care through there when I don't need to be seen in person and I just need a PCM referral or prescription update. Occasionally, they need to follow up with a phone call. This way your wife can continue to be supported by her OCONUS folks without needing to be collocated.

This decision isn’t just unfair — it’s dangerous. It tells service members, retirees and their families, who sacrifice every single day, that their health doesn’t matter. And it risks national security by making it harder for active-duty members to stay healthy and ready to serve. These changes are already harming people who depend on this care to live healthier, more active lives.

Retirees and Medicare-eligible beneficiaries are particularly affected. TRICARE For Life coverage has ended for these populations. Patients are being told “no appeals, no exceptions,” despite what TRICARE’s website states. Many were given little notice, and communication about these changes was poorly handled.

TRICARE and Medicare Reporting Requirements Personal injury cases that involve Medicare payments must be reported to the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center.","It’s been more than a month since the federal government shutdown began. While many essential services are experiencing disruptions, there are crucial programs, such as SNAP benefits, that are causing Americans to face serious struggles at a time when numerous economic challenges already exist. And yet, there has been little progress, if any, towards reopening the government.

As Virginia personal injury lawyers, we know there are concerns about how the shutdown could impact claims. A key issue is the effect it has on TRICARE and Medicare liens.

The most important thing to know is that these liens are delayed, not eliminated. But it’s also important to understand how TRICARE and Medicare liens work, and that delays or interruptions like the shutdown affect personal injury case resolution and lien negotiations.

What is a Medicare or TRICARE Lien?

If someone is injured and Medicare or TRICARE paid for medical treatment, Medicare and Tricare are entitled to recover the amount they paid if the injured party obtains a judgment or settlement from a personal injury claim. Recouping medical fees they covered is referred to as a TRICARE lien or Medicare lien, and there are strict processes that must be followed to reimburse them.

Liens ensure that federal medical programs are reimbursed when another party is held responsible for paying someone’s medical fees. The other party is considered the primary payor, and could be the person who caused the injury, their insurer, or workers’ compensation benefits. In these cases, TRICARE and Medicare are secondary payors.

For example, if you’re injured in a Virginia car accident and the other driver was found to be fully at fault through a personal injury claim, that driver’s insurance company is responsible for paying your medical bills and property damages. If Medicare or TRICARE initially covered your medical treatment, they’ll place a lien on your settlement to get back what they paid.

Can a Medicare Lien or TRICARE Lien Be Negotiated During the Shutdown?

Personal injury victims should be prepared for some delays with Medicare and TRICARE processing and customer support during the government shutdown, including negotiations. But negotiating a lien is an important step when a personal injury case settles. Why? There’s a specific process for how personal injury settlements are paid out, which includes paying Medicare liens and TRICARE liens first – before funds are disbursed to the victim. An attorney experienced in Medicare or TRICARE liens will get the best outcome in negotiations. In terms of liens being waived, it’s extremely rare, but it happens sometimes.

How the Shutdown Affects Resolving Personal Injury Claims

The government may not be fully operational, but Medicare and TRICARE lien rights still exist. While personal injury cases already take significant time to resolve, the shutdown is expected to cause some hiccups.

There are a few ways a personal injury claim may be affected during the government shutdown:

There will be operational slowdowns and delays because both TRICARE and Medicare are federal programs.

A backlog is possible once the government reopens.

Your attorney may need to estimate lien amounts or hold funds from the settlement in trust until the exact amount is confirmed.

In addition, if negotiations or getting the lien amount are delayed because of the shutdown, your personal injury case cannot be fully resolved; you may be awarded a settlement, but it cannot be fully disbursed until after the lien is paid. In such situations, a sufficient amount of money will be held in the lawyer’s trust account at the time of disbursement to the client to cover the anticipated TRICARE and Medicare liens.

Compliance with Medicare and TRICARE is crucial, and failing to comply puts you at risk of severe penalties. An attorney can walk you through the process and negotiate on your behalf to secure the compensation you deserve.

At Curcio Law, we’re committed to managing the challenges of the government shutdown and its effect on our clients’ cases. If you have any questions or concerns about your case or a lien, or if you were injured and someone else may be liable, contact our firm online or call/text (703) 836-3366.

Lien FAQs

Who Handles Lien Processing for Medicare and TRICARE?

The Defense Health Agency and its contractors handle TRICARE lien processing. The responsibility of handling Medicare lien processing falls on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

How Lien Amounts are Determined

Once Medicare or TRICARE is notified of a personal injury settlement, they’ll provide a breakdown of services and treatment they paid for that need to be reimbursed. Reviewing this information is a crucial step and should involve the help of an attorney. These programs are only allowed to recover medical costs they paid for if a personal injury settlement or judgment is obtained, which includes compensation for medical expenses.

TRICARE and Medicare Reporting Requirements

Personal injury cases that involve Medicare payments must be reported to the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center. Failing to report to the BCRC can lead to serious penalties.

For TRICARE, if they receive a claim that they deem may involve third-party liability, they’ll send a form to the claimant to complete. Once submitted, it will be used to determine what happened and whether someone else is responsible for paying for the medical treatment a beneficiary received. While TRICARE will automatically send the third-party liability form when certain codes for medical care are used, you should always notify them if you’re pursuing a personal injury claim.",https://www.legalexaminer.com/content/images/2025/11/government-shutdown@large.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-11 11:00:41.243388
