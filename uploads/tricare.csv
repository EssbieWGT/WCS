The Feres Doctrine In a nutshell, the Feres Doctrine shields military doctors and the government from cases of alleged medical malpractice.","Veterans and Advocates are fighting medical malpractice claims and demanding an end to the Feres Doctrine, but the Supreme Court just denied a paraplegic veteran’s claim.

Santa Clara, CAInjured veterans and advocates are fighting medical malpractice claims denied by the Defense Health Agency because they sustained injuries while on active duty, even though active duty also includes their time in hospital. They are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to end the 70-year-old 'unhinged and incoherent' Feres doctrine which blocks military members from bringing claims against the federal government. But on February 24, 2025 the Supreme Court issued a new blow to active duty service members hoping to seek justice following cases of alleged medical malpractice caused by military doctors, nurses and other healthcare practitioners.

Veteran Ryan Carter Denied

Maryland Air National Guard Veteran Ryan Carter underwent elective spinal surgery in 2018 – he was a healthy 43-year-old and not on active duty at the time. Carter couldn’t move his extremities when he woke from surgery; he had an MRI and was rushed back to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a second surgery to decompress his spinal canal. Carter is now a paraplegic.

Carter’s attorney filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to hear his case but said they were “stonewalled from the get-go” because his military status was deemed “active duty” while in hospital. Carter, his wife and his attorney also asked the Supreme Court have the Feres doctrine either clarified, limited or overruled and that the 1950 Feres decision by the Court contradicts the text and purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), wrongly denying military members orthodox legal remedies that Congress clearly opted to supply.

But that petition was just denied. Justice Clarence Thomas issued the only dissent opinion, saying he hoped one day the Supreme Court would overturn Feres, and that it has been almost universally condemned by judges and legal scholars. “Feres is indefensible as a matter of law, and senseless as a matter of policy,” Thomas wrote. “Had Carter been a veteran rather than an inactive reservist, he could have filed a lawsuit for the same injuries arising from the same treatment by the same military staff at the same hospital.”

Carter’s attorney told StarsandStripes.com that his case received support briefs filed by lawmakers and more than a dozen veterans organization. He will now turn his attention to an administrative claim that he filed on Carter’s behalf with the Defense Department.

Veteran Richard Stayskal Denied

An Army hospital failed to alert Green Beret Richard Stayskal to a large tumor they found on his lung in 2017. He didn’t know until months later from a doctor at a civilian hospital that he had stage 3 cancer. Military.com reported that Stayskal--after his diagnosis-- became an advocate for service members to file medical malpractice claims against the government--a process historically denied due to the Feres Doctrine (below).

Stayskal’s lung cancer changed military malpractice law and Congress created a new malpractice system called “The Sgt. First Class Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act”, which supposedly allows troops to file claims with the Defense Department alleging malpractice by military health-care providers, and allows veterans to seek damages for economic losses, pain and suffering. But it still didn’t help Stayskal.

Stayskal and his wife filed claims separately in 2021 for $20 million for pain and suffering. In 2023 his million medical malpractice claim was denied. His subsequent appeal also was denied.

“The denial of my claim by the Department of Defense, in my opinion, is a blatant act of betrayal. Not only to myself, but every service member out there,” Stayskal told StarsandStripes.com. “I stand here today on behalf of an entire generation and on behalf of future generations to ensure what happened to me will never happen again and give every breath I have for them.” Stayskal’s attorney said that “People have the right to sue if they are victims of malpractice, except for service members. It's time to stop treating them like second-class citizens. It's got to stop.” She went on. The Army told Stayskal it had ""breached standard of care"" but did not commit malpractice. The Army’s rejection letter said there was “no evidence that [Master Sgt.] Stayskal’s prognosis or chance of survival was adversely affected by the delay in the diagnosis of lung cancer.”

Stayskal, now with Stage 4 cancer, currently has no recourse to appeal his ruling. There is only one longshot: Congressman Darrell Issa and other House colleagues introduced a bill in 2023 called “The HERO Act” that would allow service members to take their medical malpractice claims to federal court. The bill has 27 sponsors but has not been considered by the House Judiciary Committee. According to Issa, “The HERO Act will grant service members who are victims of medical malpractice in a DOD medical treatment facility the right and opportunity to take their claim to District Court—the same legal process as military spouses, DOD civilians, and anyone else. It will finally reform the current failing system and replace it with one that gives our military the fair shot at justice they deserve.""

The Feres Doctrine

In a nutshell, the Feres Doctrine shields military doctors and the government from cases of alleged medical malpractice. The legal site Justia explains the Feres Doctrine: “The United States is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to members of the armed forces sustained while on active duty and not on furlough and resulting from the negligence of others in the armed forces.”

Troops still aren't allowed to file lawsuits over medical malpractice under the Feres Doctrine, set by a 1950 Supreme Court decision that protected the military and its officials from liability for combat-related injuries, although family members may file claims and lawsuits in civil court under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Aside from medical claims, the Feres doctrine has also limited the ability of people to bring military rape cases to civil courts.

In May 2024, Military.com reported that the Pentagon was “tweaking its formula for calculating payments to U.S. service members for medical malpractice claims, a move that could put more money in the pockets of affected troops and veterans. In October 2023, the amount of money for noneconomic damages rose from $600,000 to $750,000. Until 2021, service members were not allowed to file claims for medical malpractice or sue the Defense Department over injuries or illnesses that occur while on active duty. Stayskal and his wife both filed $20 million claims for pain and suffering, well over the current $750,000 cap for such claims. When Stayskal’s claim was denied, he told The Washington Post that Army Secretary Christine Wormuth offered him $600,000 using her discretionary funding authority, which was the maximum amount allowed for pain and suffering damages in the military's medical malpractice system. He refused the money.

Crosland’s departure comes amid Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the Pentagon.
Last month, Hegseth said he believed that “diversity is our strength” was the “single dumbest phrase in military history.” The defense secretary also moved to end commemorations for Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and more.

On Friday (February 28), Crosland was forced to retire from her military role just a week after President Donald Trump fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officers, sources told Reuters.

Crosland’s retirement was publicly announced Friday, but Reuters reported that the senior officer was told she must resign.

“I want to thank Crosland for her dedication to the nation, to the military health system, and to Army medicine for the past 32 years,” Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in a statement Friday.

The sources, a current and former official, said Crosland wasn’t given a reason why she had to retire. The Pentagon also declined to provide a reason why Crosland allegedly resigned.

The Maximum Permissible Interest Rate (MPIR) increased to 8.42% effective from January 1st 2025.

As facilities proceed to increase RAD’s, the lesser profitability of a concessional resident will result in a clear preference for RAD paying residents.

The effective Refundable Accommodation Contribution (RAC) on a refurbished aged care home, above the 40% concessional ratio, will be $302,671 from 1st January 2025, which will put pressure on those looking to find a concessional placement given average RAD’s are now much higher than this amount.

Support from the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine allowed the hospital to maintain its 24/7 ER service.

Naval Hospital Jacksonville will keep its emergency room running around the clock despite earlier statements that the ER’s schedule would be cut in half, the hospital announced over the weekend.

“Naval Hospital Jacksonville remains committed to providing exceptional care to our patients and ensuring access to the services they rely on,” read a Facebook message the hospital posted Saturday.

The message said the ER was staying open “through the support of the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine,” an enterprise created last year that includes the 154-year-old Navy Medical Corps comprised of 4,300 active-duty and reserve physicians. The Defense Health Agency oversees both civilian and military staffs at more than 700 military medical facilities.

The hospital at Naval Air Station Jacksonville had been scheduled to change Monday to ER hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. due to what Capt. Craig Malloy, its commanding officer, last week called “temporary staffing issues.”

The scaled-back hours had been projected to last into the summer.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.
“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt.
“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha.
“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander.","HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, New Mexico -- The 49th Medical Group is taking medical readiness training to the next level to enhance military medics’ ability to deliver lifesaving care on the battlefield.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.

“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt. Shelby Vande Zande, 49th Healthcare Operations Squadron primary care flight chief and the group’s alternate 4N functional manager. “That was ultimately the goal when setting up the program -- provide quality training and retention of skills.”

The Air Force launched the MEDIC-X program in 2024 to enhance medical Airmen’s ability to provide basic clinical support to warfighters. The program trains medics, including those not involved in patient care, such as administrators or laboratory technicians, to be proficient in 52 lifesaving skills spanning 13 clinical categories.

“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha. “Clinical providers and nurses may be limited on the battlefield; this initiative enhances our ability to deliver safe, high-quality care to our warfighters in any strategic environment.”

Incorporating a mix of classroom and hands-on training, Airmen practice skills such as IV fluid management, oxygen therapy, vital signs, dressing changes, and on- and off-loading patients from fixed-wing aircraft.

Rather than adhere to the traditional training modules and to enhance skills retention, the 49 MDG transformed training into a series of challenges with teams competing to earn the prestigious title of MEDIC-X Module Winner.

“At the inception of the training, we brainstormed the different ways that we could deliver the training that would result in a meaningful outcome while keeping the training interesting,” Vande Zande said.

Capt. Natasha Lindblom, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight commander, said creativity and fun were key to the brainstorming process. “If training is not engaging, it’s more easily forgotten,” she said.

One recent challenge tested Airmen’s ability to feed patients under challenging circumstances. The patient in the scenario wore “drunk glasses” to make their vision blurry, while a teammate fed the patient three spoons of pudding with the aim of not spilling a drop.

“It was great practice for situations where feeding a patient in distress may be needed,” Lindblom explained. “There was certainly a fair amount of pudding spilled.”

Another challenge tested Airmen’s ability to measure a patient’s fluid input and output, which is critical in ensuring fluid imbalance doesn’t impact patients’ stability. Using a chest atrium, foley bag, and syringe for output, as well as a cup of ice, glass of water, and unit of fake blood for input, the team had to measure fluid input and output, correspond the amounts to a number-to-letter chart, then spell out a word that unlocked a lock and revealed a small prize.

“All the while we had volunteers from the line side present yelling and making menacing sounds,” Lindblom said. “The challenge really got their adrenaline going. I was impressed at how many people remembered that 100 ml of ice is equal to 50 ml of fluid.”

“When we are in an austere environment performing these tasks, it will be stressful, and when people are stressed, they may make mistakes,” she added. “Practice is key to performing well under pressure.”

The winning teams receive a small prize, such as a hand-crocheted liver or gallbladder, courtesy of Lindblom. The prizes are small, but participants walk away with a sense of pride and achievement, she said.

The engaging format has received a positive reception, said Senior Airman Claire Pruitt, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight.

“Making MEDIC-X an enjoyable learning experience helps students stay more motivated, absorb the information more effectively, and develop the confidence needed to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios,” she said. “I love being able to see our hard work make others smile and keep them engaged in an ever-evolving field.”

MEDIC-X is beneficial not only for Airmen, but for the clinical providers on scene, Lindblom noted.

“If I can have non-clinical Airmen measuring inputs and outputs, then nurses can administer medications, hang IVs, do all of the things that nurses need to do,” she said. “Clinical personnel can focus on their tasks and the non-clinical Airmen can take care of the rest, especially when in a situation where prolonged field care is needed.”

Vande Zande said she saw the impact of the MEDIC-X program firsthand during a recent mass casualty exercise. “Our providers, nurses, and medical technicians were overrun with patients, and a lab tech and an admin tech stepped in to assist with providing ventilations and wound treatment to the patients,” she said. “Suddenly, our manpower team was far more than security and patient movement. Having the basic skills necessary to step in during an emergency is invaluable to the team as a whole and does nothing but benefit the patient.”

This collaborative approach strengthens teamwork and ensures Airmen are prepared for the unexpected.

“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander. “It enables clinical personnel to take care of casualties without having to worry about dividing their time and energies amongst many. It could be the difference between life and death for one of our warfighters.”

Harrell, one of the architects of the MEDIC-X program, praised the 49 MDG’s creative efforts to enhance medical readiness training.

“In a deployed setting, our medics will be called on to provide potentially lifesaving care and support, and they need to be able to do so confidently and deliberately,” Harrell said. “The 49 MDG’s innovative approach to MEDIC-X is a prime example of how leadership is harnessing ingenuity to ensure medical readiness and the delivery of exceptional care to our warfighters in any combat setting, no matter how austere or remote.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8905127/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-09 18:50:22.370749

The addition of this advanced training tool underscores the hospital’s commitment to improving neonatal care and aligns with ongoing efforts by Navy Medicine and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to enhance medical readiness and patient outcomes. Mrs. Katia Arico, the command’s Staff Education and Training Coordinator and Trainer, led the year-long planning and procurement of the RQI for NRP Skills Station.

Hospital staff from across departments gathered for a lively celebration, themed as a baby shower, to mark the arrival of the innovative simulator. The event featured a range of activities, including games and prizes, with the staff actively participating in a poll to name the new neonatal manikin. The winning name, NOAH—an acronym for Neonatal Outcomes And Healthcare—was chosen as a symbol of the hospital’s dedication to improving neonatal care through cutting-edge training technology.

The new RQI simulator offers significant value to the hospital’s training program by helping healthcare providers maintain and improve their neonatal resuscitation skills. With NRP renewal training required every two years, the gap between training sessions can often lead to skill degradation. The use of simulation provides an effective solution to this challenge, enabling clinicians to repeatedly practice critical skills, sustain knowledge, and maintain proficiency.

The simulator, designed to replicate real-life neonatal resuscitation scenarios, enables healthcare providers to practice essential techniques, such as positive pressure ventilation, with real-time feedback. Key metrics, including mask seal, ventilation rate, and pressure, are monitored to guide improvements in clinical performance. The staff will utilize the simulator on a quarterly basis to practice the skills required to get newborn babies breathing in the critical first minutes after birth.

U.S. NMRTC/ NH Sigonella ensures maximum readiness by providing high-quality, safe patient and family-centered care to NATO and transient DoD forces in the U.S. Fifth Fleet and U.S. Sixth Fleet areas of operation and delivers an average of 50 babies per year. While the volume may be lower than larger hospitals, the importance of maintaining proficiency in high-risk neonatal scenarios remains paramount. The hospital’s healthcare professionals are called to manage neonatal resuscitations, which demand not only advanced knowledge but also immediate, precise action. “Our team is exceptional in providing care, but we know that high-risk scenarios, while rare, can be life-altering when they occur,” said Cmdr. (Dr.) Sebastian Lara, the sole Pediatrician at the hospital. “That’s why RQI for NRP is so important. It allows our staff to stay current with the latest neonatal resuscitation techniques and ensures that we are ready to respond effectively when it matters most.”

This initiative aligns with the Navy Surgeon General’s call for healthcare teams to remain agile and competent in a broad spectrum of clinical situations, even in low-volume settings. Lt. Cmdr. Brandi Gibson, the command’s NRP Program Director, shared her thoughts on the new system. “With such a low delivery volume, it’s easy to feel out of practice when we encounter a complicated birth. RQI has given our staff the ability to practice the most important neonatal resuscitation skills regularly, so when we do face a difficult situation, we are confident and ready to act.”

The hospital’s commitment to safety and readiness also aligns with the Navy’s broader mission of providing comprehensive healthcare services to military personnel and their families, no matter where they are stationed. In an environment where resources are sometimes limited and the stakes are high, maintaining a culture of excellence is essential. As Cmdr. Lara concluded, “We may not face a high volume of complicated deliveries, but when they do occur, we want to be ready. RQI for NRP ensures that we have the skills and knowledge to provide the best care possible and live up to the trust our patients place in us every day.”

The successful launch of the RQI for NRP program at U.S. NMRTC/NH Sigonella is a testament to the dedication of military medical personnel in upholding the highest standards of care, readiness, and patient safety. Through this initiative, the hospital continues to foster a culture of continuous improvement while ensuring that its staff is prepared for the most challenging and critical situations, both in peacetime and in the line of duty.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8904905/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-09 12:50:26.028265

My doctors diagnosed me with an insufficient cervix and said that next time I get pregnant they would “watch me closer” but could not guarantee that they could help. Fast forward we have moved to a new area and I am establishing care here. My OBGYN provider wants to do surgery due to damage to my cervix and the fact that I have been diagnosed with insufficient cervix. This surgery is called a transabdominal cerclage that would reinforce my cervix for any future pregnancies and in general. My surgery has been booked but I am pretty positive Tricare will deny paying due to them seeing it as a “unnecessary procedure.” Has anyone dealt with this? I have two death certificates for two children and physical evidence from providers that this surgery would help me in the long run. I’m in the dreaded wait for pre-auth and I just have a feeling they won’t care and deny it regardless?,,N,-1.0,2025-03-09 12:50:30.423290

Somebody, for the love of god.. please point me in the right direction for how I can resolve this.","Recently PCSd out west transferring over to tricare west. For my 2 kids that are in the 0-6 years old “well-child” criteria of tricare I assumed that all routine check ups for IE) 6mo 12mo, etc. check ups would be fully covered. Not only under the “well-child” criteria, but that’s these type of appointments fall under the category of preventative appts. Several weeks after the appointments both on the same day for both children; we were sent a bill in the mail for the appointment that needed to be paid. I was sent through the witch-hunt. After calling the clinic they transferred me to the billing department multiple times where they said the appointment was mis-coded by the physician and should’ve been coded as a preventative and that I could only change it by speaking with the physician for them to do an amendment to the visit to recode. After getting in touch with the physician office I was told they couldn’t change it, and that I needed to speak to either billing or tricare. Talking to someone different in billing a 3rd/4th time I was told that the EOB for coverage covered the visit but not “technical fee” also known as a facility fee. After speaking with tricare they agreed with my train of thought but wanted to transfer me to their claims department. After 4 attempts of getting in touch their claims department, being on hold for over an hour each time and requesting a call back I was unsuccessful in ever getting in touch with the claims department. Seems impossible. It is my perception that on tricare select with my kids being under 6yo doing routine “preventative” checkups, as well as “well-child” that I shouldn’t be paying anything out of pocket for these appointments. So now I’m sitting here with a $240 bill for a single checkup, many more appointments to come for them as they hit milestones of routine checkups for under 1yo. In search of any way to resolve this or what my next actions should be to fix this issue. I’m an active duty service member, have been in for quite a while, I’m on my 6th duty station and chose to pay a little extra for my beneficiaries to be on select so they wouldn’t have to deal with lack of competence and extreme levels of unprofessionalism we’ve experienced on post time and time again. It seems absurd to me that me as customer has to call numerous times from office to office for them to just tell me that it’s a different person that’s responsible for the billing mistakes.

What makes where you live feel like home? It’s not just bricks and mortar – it’s the warmth, the welcome, and the people who make you feel you belong. In our Retirement Living Communities, it’s often the wonderful women on our teams who transform spaces into true communities where residents don’t just live – they flourish.

At TriCare, we see first-hand how our female Village Managers and support staff bring something special to our Retirement Communities. They’re natural connectors, brilliant listeners, and champions of independence who understand that retirement should be about enjoying life to the fullest. This International Women’s Day, we’re celebrating these incredible women who create environments where residents feel both supported and empowered.

Creating connection in every interaction

Speak into any of our Retirement Communities residents and they will tell you it is all about the ‘vibe’, and you’ll likely find a female team member having a friendly chat with residents in a, remembering to ask about someone’s garden after the recent rain, or asking about grandchildren by name. These seemingly small moments are actually the building blocks of community – creating spaces where everyone feels seen and valued.

Our Village Managers and staff have a natural talent for fostering these connections, whether they’re welcoming new residents with a personal touch or remembering significant anniversaries. They understand that genuine relationships are at the heart of happy retirement living, and they nurture these connections every day with authentic care and interest.

Champions of vibrant community life

“Have you heard about the bus trip next Tuesday?”

“There’s a new face at morning tea – let me introduce you!”

“We haven’t seen you for a while. Are you okay?”

The women on our teams are often the cheerful voices encouraging participation and making sure everyone feels cared for.

From coordinating day trips that create shared memories to supporting resident-led committees and interest groups, the women in our team and communities play a crucial role in keeping community calendars full of opportunities for connection. They strike that perfect balance – providing just enough support while empowering residents to take ownership of their community activities.

They’re also brilliant at spotting when someone might be feeling a bit isolated and finding gentle ways to help them reconnect. That might mean sitting for a cuppa with a resident who’s been quiet lately or suggesting activities that match someone’s interests. It’s this thoughtful approach that helps maintain the social fabric of our communities.

Creating spaces that feel like home

There’s something special about the way women in our Retirement Communities approach their work and village – they don’t just manage spaces; they nurture environments where people feel they truly belong.

Our female team members often bring those homely touches that make all the difference – fresh flowers in the community centre, remembering dietary preferences without being asked, or creating seasonal decorations that make communal areas feel festive and inviting. They understand that independence doesn’t mean doing everything alone – it means having the right support, exactly when you need it.

The perfect blend of professional and personal

What makes our women in Retirement Communities so valued is their ability to be both professionally capable and personally warm. They’re experts at navigating administrative requirements and community management while never losing sight of the human element.

They know when to step in with support and when to step back to allow independence. They celebrate residents’ independence while providing reassurance that help is there if needed. It’s this delicate balance that allows our Retirement Living Communities to feel both secure and freeing – places where residents can truly enjoy their retirement years with confidence.

This International Women’s Day, we’re raising a glass to the women who create the heart of our Retirement Communities as well as the men who support us in gender equality- the connectors, the supporters, and the champions of joyful, independent living. Their dedication creates places where retirement isn’t just about having somewhere to live – it’s about having somewhere to belong.

That’s the real magic of community, and we couldn’t do it without them.",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/03/Untitled-design-5.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-08 19:50:28.713723

It’s kinda awful. Last year tried to change my pcm and I had to call soo many offices. A couple said they’ve had to call so many times over two years to get their info removed and they’re still dealing with it.

My favorite part was Tricare sent me a letter changing my pcm (to one who wasn’t practicing at that location anymore) because my current was no longer with Tricare. I go on the Tricare website to find a new pcm to only see the pcm they pulled me off of listed as a provider.

Well, since they haven’t paid any claims since they took over I will leave the assumption up to you.

With the delays in payments maybe providers are going to stop taking tricare at all. I can’t blame them. If you want anything to happen contact the news and your congressmen. I made a gpt so you don’t even have to think about how to write. #tricarewestfail

TRICARE is a government-run insurance provider that serves millions of military families and veterans across the country. As of January 1, 2025, TriWest became the new provider network for the Western Region, comprised of 26 states, including Colorado, overseeing 4.3 million eligible TRICARE beneficiaries.

Since the New Year, Licensed Clinical Social Workers like Tawnia Valdez, who operates a private practice in Old Colorado City. As a 20-year Army veteran herself, she works mostly with fellow veterans and military families.

""I feel like it's a culture and an area that I enjoy working with,"" explained Valdez.

She believed that everything was going to carry on as normal once January 1st arrived, but instead, she says the rollout of TriWest was done without any concrete communication.

""As of today, I still haven't had any formal message or statement or anything from the previous TRICARE or TriWest, which is now in service. It's all really word of mouth and how to go about things,"" explained Valdez.

Now, with the first week of March completed, she says that she hasn't been paid for upwards of 50 claims that she has filed for sessions she has provided for her clients, and the unpaid claims have begun to pile up.

""My claims are going through. They're just in a hold status. I haven't been paid for any TRICARE clients,"" she said.

Valdez says the backlog has forced her and other colleagues in the therapy space to even put TRICARE clients on hold until further notice.

""The problem they were running into is trying to find a referral source within this community. First off, people are hesitant to take more TRICARE clients, and they may not be fully credentialed to be able to take TRICARE claims,"" she explained, adding that many LCSWs and therapists are unsure if they're even licensed to be working with TRICARE as of April 1, 2025, since communication has been lacking.

""The idea was that for the first 90 days, we would all still be able to file claims, but after that we still some of us [that] have no status of if we're credentialed with this new TRICARE, or what our status is."" she said.

Valdez says colleagues in Colorado are also running into financial challenges at their own practices, due to the unpaid claims.

""Some therapists are needing to obtain other sources of income because they just can't have that many holds or they're not being paid,"" said Valdez.

TriWest sent this statement to KRDO13 on Friday:

""“TriWest is honored to partner with the Department of Defense to administer the TRICARE program in 26 western states. All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned. In collaboration with our partners, we are making progress every day as we deliver access to care for 4.3 million eligible beneficiaries in the West Region.”

“They were escorted out to where there were security cars, and a line of security guards were standing with arms folded,” the AFGE told Federal News Network.
While those probationary employees were told that their termination letters would be sent out to them, they were also informed that they were being placed on administrative leave until the official termination date at the end of March.
At the same time, a different Navy organization is preparing for layoffs, but no probationary employees have been placed on leave so far.
The Defense Department initially postponed the terminations of its probationary employees to assess national security and readiness implications of the firings.","The Defense Department has started placing probationary employees on administrative leave while they are awaiting official action by their organizations or until their termination takes effect.

According to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) local, approximately 20 civilian probationary employees at the Defense Health Agency were summoned to a conference room at the agency’s headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, where they were informed that they were being terminated. They were told to hand over their ID cards and laptops before being walked out of the building.

“They were escorted out to where there were security cars, and a line of security guards were standing with arms folded,” the AFGE told Federal News Network.

While those probationary employees were told that their termination letters would be sent out to them, they were also informed that they were being placed on administrative leave until the official termination date at the end of March.

The Defense Health Agency didn’t provide the exact number of employees fired so far, but the agency told Federal News Network that dismissals have been limited to headquarters positions “that are administrative in nature.”

In a memo signed by Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Stephen Ferrara that was sent to the fired DHA employees, the agency cited the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance stating that “an appointment is not final until the probationary period is over” and that “until the probationary period has been completed, a probationer has the burden to demonstrate why it is in the public interest for the government to finalize an appointment to the civil service for this particular individual.”

The memo added that OPM has “emphasized that individual employee performance measurement should be aligned with and support organizational goals and focus employee efforts on achieving organizational and group goals” and that OPM has directed agencies to “consider whether an employee’s performance is in the best interest of the government.”

“Based on the OPM guidance referenced above, the agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest,” the memo sent out to the fired DHA workers reads.

While the termination notice cited employees’ failure to meet performance standards, one DHA probationary employee who was among those laid off this week told Federal News Network that he had received a good first review and had strong references from both his immediate supervisor and a senior official in the organization. He is now appealing his termination through the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and his local representative.

Meanwhile, one Navy civilian employee who is a retired officer with more than two decades of service told Federal News Network he was placed on administrative leave for three weeks but no further guidance has been provided ever since he turned in his computer and was escorted out of the building on Tuesday.

“I don’t even have good guidance. [Human Resources] told me they don’t have anything to give me and that I’m on admin leave. The HR is reactive, and because this has never been done before, they’re scrambling,” he said.

At the same time, a different Navy organization is preparing for layoffs, but no probationary employees have been placed on leave so far.

Last month, the office of the secretary of defense said the department was preparing to reduce its civilian workforce by 5-8%, and announced that approximately 5,400 probationary employees would be laid off. The Defense Department initially postponed the terminations of its probationary employees to assess national security and readiness implications of the firings.
