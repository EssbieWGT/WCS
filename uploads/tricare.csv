First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Net revenue was $26.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $46.5 million in the prior year quarter.

Gross profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was $18.2 million, or 69% of revenue, as compared to $37.2 million or 80% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2024. Gross profit was affected by the Tricare payment suspension and continuing to support new and existing Tricare patients which yields cost of goods sold with no related revenue.

Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased 28% to $16.9 million from $23.4 million for the same period in 2024, primarily due to decreased headcount in the sales force.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025, were $14.4 million, versus $13.3 million in the prior year period.

Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2025, totaled ($10.4) million, or ($0.33) per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $10,000, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, in the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was ($11.8) million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Cash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was ($10.5) million. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had working capital of $40.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents were $23.9 million at March 31, 2025.

Second Quarter 2025 Guidance

The Company expects Q2 2025 net revenue of at least $27 million. Loss per share is expected to be ($0.20) per share or better. The Company expects quarterly revenues to increase throughout the year with the usual seasonality typically experienced.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Zynex reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other income/expense, stock compensation, restructuring, receivables adjustment and non-cash lease charges). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance.

Report casts doubt on Planned Parenthood's abortion pill safety claim,Nancy Flanders,,,,,https://www.liveaction.org/news/safer-tylenol-report-planned-parenthood-abortion-pill/,"Yet, for years, Planned Parenthood, its representatives, and its friends in the media have claimed that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol.
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood claims on its website that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol.
She was 23 years old when she took the abortion pill during what would be her third abortion.
She explained what happened next: One day at work, I started hemorrhaging.… This was probably 8 weeks [after taking the abortion pill].
Around half of U.S. states are not required to report complications from the abortion pill, making complications difficult to track.","A newly released study on complications of the abortion pill claims that “serious adverse events” from mifepristone occurred at a rate about 22 times higher than the rate reported by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet, for years, Planned Parenthood, its representatives, and its friends in the media have claimed that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol.

The study, “The Abortion Pill Harms Women,” published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), reviewed data from an insurance claims database that included 865,727 mifepristone prescriptions that were written from 2017 to 2023. Mifepristone is the first drug in the two-drug abortion pill regimen. Researchers found that 10.93% of those abortions caused serious adverse events, including hemorrhaging, infection, and sepsis, in contrast to the FDA’s mifepristone label, which states that there is a “less than 0.5 percent” serious adverse events rate. That data included single-payer insurance claims as well as Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. It excluded “transactions for which the insurer is also the provider (as is the case with some HMOs and much VA care), as well as cash pay transactions (which are disproportionately common for abortion).”

Based on this data analysis, that would mean one in ten women experience at least one serious complication from taking mifepristone within 45 days — 22 times higher than the “less than 0.5 percent” serious adverse events rate reported by the FDA on the mifepristone label, according to this study. The study authors state that serious adverse events in multiple categories were accounted for in the reported rate.

Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood claims on its website that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol. As previously reported by Live Action News:

[Tylenol] is taken millions of times annually by prescription, and its over-the-counter sales reach into the billions of dollars. Many times more people are using this drug every day than are using mifepristone; it is therefore disingenuous to make a safety claim based solely on a comparison of raw hospital visit numbers for both drugs. It’s entirely possible that more people go to the hospital after taking Tylenol – because more people take it in the first place.

A 2016 study found that .056% of Tylenol doses sold resulted in a hospital visit. However, the new abortion pill study, completed using real-world data, found 4.73% of women who used mifepristone for an abortion ended up visiting an emergency room — an 84 times higher rate.

‘Safe and relatively painless’?

Kristen Farrell shared with Live Action News that her experience with the abortion pill was “the most horrifying and humiliating experience” of her life. She was 23 years old when she took the abortion pill during what would be her third abortion. She was told it would be “safe” and “relatively painless.”

“It was neither,” she said. “… there was the quick onset of excruciating, mind numbing pain. It was so bad that I ran to the toilet, calling on my roomate, to stay there with me. I felt as if my entire abdomen was being squeezed, crushed and wrung out like a wet rag. The thought that I could possibly die during an abortion crossed my mind, and I became terrified. The pain was so bad that I began dry heaving, groaning and crying, saliva dripping from my mouth. I remember blood and pain, nothing else. The minutes seemed like hours, but eventually, I passed something (I don’t know what) and the pain faded. I can’t remember too much after that, but a few days later, I was back to work.”

But while working as a waitress, the bleeding got heavier and heavier. She changed pads and tried everything to contain it, but nothing worked. She continued:

… I assumed I was hemorrhaging and tearily accepted help from some fellow cocktail waitresses who offered to walk me to the locker rooms. As we walked back, I could feel the blood rushing down my legs, for all to see. Once I got into the locker room, I locked myself into the largest bathroom stall and continued to pass massive blood clots. There was blood on the floor, blood on the toilet, blood on my hands. I can’t explain the fear. Through my sobs, my manager asked me if she could call an ambulance. I, of course, refused. How could I look anyone in the eye? I managed to clean up, wrap myself up in toilet paper and I drove myself to the ER.

Once inside and able to speak with medical personnel, I discovered the truth: ‘Not everything had come out.’

Farrell, like 24,563 women between 2017 and 2023, was experiencing a failed abortion and needed to undergo a surgical abortion to remove the retained body parts of her deceased child.

A year later, she still had complications

An unnamed woman shared her story on AbortionChangesYou.com, saying that after taking the abortion pill, she bled heavily for eight weeks before being rushed to the hospital for an emergency D&C. After the single mother of three learned she was pregnant again, she took the abortion pill. She explained what happened next:

One day at work, I started hemorrhaging.… This was probably 8 weeks [after taking the abortion pill]. I had been notifying the clinic I felt I was bleeding too long and too heavy. They always brushed me off saying yes you can bleed longer. Well, this day I couldn’t ignore it. I was changing tampons and pads that overflowed every 20 minutes.

To finish my shift, I stuffed paper towels in. Nothing would hold it until I bled down my pants in front of a patient. I made it home covered up with a jacket. I was feeling like passing out and asked my brother to take me to the hospital. I had to admit to him what was going on.

At the ER, she learned her hemoglobin had dropped to seven. A low count for women is anything under 12. A year later, she was still struggling with complications, including severe anemia that required IV iron treatments lasting four hours each time.

As use of the abortion pill continues to rise, the number of women suffering serious complications from the drug mifepristone will also rise, but without studies like this, the world may never know. Around half of U.S. states are not required to report complications from the abortion pill, making complications difficult to track.

The EPPC is encouraging the FDA to analyze the same data provided in its study analysis, and to consider whether the abortion pill should remain on the market with safeguards put back into place, or if it should remain on the market at all.",https://www.liveaction.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-458559027-Tylenol.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-29 14:56:22.413547

THE DAILY CALLER | Joni Ernst Reveals More Examples Of HUD Bureaucrats Bilking Taxpayers Ernst’s efforts to fight for taxpayers have earned her sweeping praise.","WASHINGTON – In case you missed it, Senate DOGE Caucus Chair Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has been leading the fight in Washington to end taxpayer-funded union time (TFUT), the insane practice of requiring taxpayers to foot the bill for federal employees engaging in union activity while on the clock, including lobbying Congress for higher pay, negotiating telework agreements, and securing other cushy perks.

While data was not released under the Biden administration, the most recent report from 2019 showed federal employees spent 2,606,390 hours engaged in union activities while on the clock for the American people, costing taxpayers $160 million in just one year.

To uncover the true cost of TFUT, Senator Ernst demanded in December 2024 that 24 federal agencies provide accurate and up to date data. Ernst’s efforts have already uncovered the jaw-dropping details of the true cost to taxpayers at three federal agencies.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revealed an 11% increase in costs since 2019, racking up more than $400,000 annually.

NY POST | Nuclear agency had 11% increase in taxpayer-funded union time from five years ago, records show

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) similarly admitted that north of $400,000 was spent every year for union activity.

NY POST | NASA spent over $400K taxpayer dollars on union time last year

The real bombshell came from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which oversees the TRICARE health benefits for servicemembers, who said its bureaucrats spent 87,000 hours on union activity costing taxpayers $3.3 million.

NY POST | Workers at Defense Health Agency spent $3.3 million and 87,000 hours working on their own union benefits

Because the data from these three agencies is just the tip of the iceberg, Senator Ernst sent a letter to the Trump administration requesting that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) resume tracking and publicly disclosing the total cost of TFUT across government to provide taxpayers with a true accounting. The Trump administration has agreed and will soon publish a government-wide report. Ernst also introduced the Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Transparency Act to require the annual public disclosure of the cost of TFUT to the American people.

Transparency is an important step but Ernst has also introduced the Protecting Taxpayers’ Wallet Act to require federal unions to reimburse taxpayers for all costs involving TFUT to potentially save the American people more than a billion dollars over the next decade.

Her bill will ensure that no more tax dollars are spent on bureaucrats securing cushy perks as was the case at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ernst uncovered that the IRS’s union secured a cushy telework agreement allowing employees to come in just two days per two-week pay period. To rub salt in the wound, all of the negotiations were done on taxpayers’ dime.

NY POST | IRS workers only had to show up to work once a week in person, before Trump took over

Last week, Ernst sent a letter to Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner about how his department has been ground zero for TFUT abuse by bureaucrats. She detailed examples of bureaucrats launching real estate careers, going on beach vacations, and even sitting in jail cells all while allegedly on union time.

Ernst’s efforts to fight for taxpayers have earned her sweeping praise.

NY POST | Public-sector workers spent 87,000 hours screwing you — just at one agency, just in two years

The New York Post Editorial Board wrote about Senator Ernst and called her, “A fierce advocate for the troops as well as a staunch fighter against fraud and waste as head of the Senate DOGE caucus.”

The Public Labor Unions Accountability Committee, who advocates for holding public sector unions accountable, has applauded Ernst’s work and emphasized that American taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going.

FOX NEWS | MARY KATHARINE HAM: Teachers union bosses put themselves first, teachers and students last

Fox News contributor, OutKick columnist, and Senior Advisor to the Public Labor Unions Accountability Committee Mary Katharine Ham praised Ernst’s efforts and demanded that public sector unions be removed from politics. Ham also called out the true cost of public sector unions on the Ruthless podcast and the Guy Benson Show.

WASHINGTON EXAMINER | No more union time on taxpayer dime

The Washington Examiner Editorial board applauded Ernst’s Protecting Taxpayer’s Wallet Act in a piece calling for the end of union time on the taxpayers’ dime.

Americans For Fair Treatment, an advocacy group for getting union spending out of politics, has also praised the Protecting Taxpayer’s Wallet Act and called for its swift passage to bring a little fiscal sanity to Washington.

Crenshaw explained the facility’s wide array of outpatient mental health services, including individual psychotherapy, readiness-related psychological evaluations, and Personnel Reliability Program evaluations for Sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen across nearly 300 tenant commands in the Pacific Northwest.

Crenshaw, with other behavioral health technicians, pioneered a high level of clinical involvement, characterized by their engagement in nearly 115 safety checks, roughly 585 access-to-care appointments, and over 430 group therapy sessions and individual patient follow-up care.

“Doing eyes and hands-on patient care is something we need to codify. Very impressive,” remarked Johnson.

Johnson also met with NHB’s leaders and held an all-hands call for senior enlisted and junior officers to candidly discuss the current state of the Defense Health Agency in military medicine.

“As a Navy military treatment facility, your main support is to ships, submarines, and shore commands. The Army has its brigades to look after. Air Force has wings. Each service component exists for lethality, and our job is to ensure we’re medically ready to go to war, if needed,” Johnson said.

Staffing concerns and fiscal constraints were top topics of discussion during Johnson’s visit, readily recognized as a common theme throughout the MHS.

“There’s a lot of business in health care delivery, but in the end, it’s really all about connecting to people,” she said.

“We’re a unique health system,” continued Johnson. “We train and prepare to go to war. There’s no civilian at the front dealing with casualties. That’s all you.

“Our nation’s servicemembers and their families make incredible sacrifices every day, and they deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families.
The majority of Americans — 85% — support access to IVF, one of the most effective medical treatments for those struggling to build their family.
Expanding TRICARE coverage to include IVF and fertility care is not just the right thing to do—it’s a critical investment in the health and well-being of military families.","Today (April 24, 2025), during National Infertility Awareness Week, Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland (WA-10), led the reintroduction of the Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act, which would expand TRICARE coverage to make assisted reproductive services, including IVF, available to all active-duty servicemembers (including the Reserve and National Guard) and dependents – regardless of service-connection requirements, sex, gender, sexual orientation, or marital status of the servicemember or their dependent.

This bill has been endorsed by RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the Modern Military Association of America.

“Answering the call to serve often means making a great number of sacrifices for your country. Being able to start a family should not be one of them. This bill removes current barriers in TRICARE and helps ensure that all servicemembers can access the fertility care they deserve to start a family,” said Strickland.

“Our nation’s servicemembers and their families make incredible sacrifices every day, and they deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families.

Expanding TRICARE coverage to include IVF and fertility care is not just the right thing to do—it’s a critical investment in the health and well-being of military families. RESOLVE stands strongly in support of this long-overdue change, and we urge Congress to act swiftly to ensure that no one who serves our country is denied the chance to become a parent,” said Barbara Collura, President/CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association

“For decades, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has been a leader in promoting policies that expand access to fertility treatments like IVF for military families, who face unique family building challenges due to the nature of their work in service to our country,” said Sean Tipton, ASRM Chief Advocacy & Policy Officer. “We thank Congresswoman Strickland, Delegate Norton, Congressman Takano, and Congresswoman Pressley for calling attention to the fact that current Department of Defense (DoD) policy – which limits TRICARE coverage for fertility treatments to only service members with a service-connected illness or injury – fails to provide our military families with adequate access to care. It’s about time we address this shortcoming so that our brave men and women in uniform do not have to juggle the out-of-pocket costs for treatment with their service, end their military careers to access health care, or forego their dreams of having a family.”

“The Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act is a critical piece of legislation. By removing legal barriers that currently exclude from insurance coverage servicemembers whose infertility is not directly service-related, and safeguarding against discrimination in coverage of this care, the Act gets us closer to ensuring that all servicemembers and their dependents can have equitable and non-discriminatory access to the fertility health care they need to build their families,” said Karla Torres, Senior Human Rights Counsel, Center for Reproductive Rights

The legislation is cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC), Rep. Mark Takano (CA-39), and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-7).",https://thesubtimes.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/TST-Featured-Image.png,N,1.0,2025-04-28 21:56:23.170812

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex also revealed that Tricare, the healthcare program for uniformed service members that ""currently represents approximately 20-25% of [the Company's] annual revenue"", ""has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

Skinner integrated primary care into their holistic medicine clinic more than a year ago to offer more services for their main clientele: military families.
A partial statement from Humana Military earlier this year cited that the subcontractor improperly processed Humana Military insurance claims for patients under Tricare East, the health care program designed for military families.
Skinner said as of March, they had received two claims reimbursements from Humana Military insurance with hundreds of other claims left unpaid.
We anticipate the remaining issues slowing down our claims processing and payment systems will be fixed by early March.” A more recent development on the Humana Military website confirmed ongoing issues with processing of claims.","Reimbursements for medical clinics in the North Carolina Sandhills continue to be an issue.

Several clinic owners in Moore and Cumberland counties still need to be paid for services rendered to patients who primarily come from military families.

Erin Skinner, an owner of the Thrive clinic in Southern Pines, said she faces the possibility of filing for bankruptcy.

She prides herself on giving the best nutritional advice possible to every patient she meets at the Thrive clinic.

“We opened as a group in 2021 as a group of just dietitians practicing functional medicine care,” Skinner said.

The same kinds as hers. Skinner’s husband is active-duty military, and she is a veteran.

Which is why the mom of three said she couldn’t believe getting reimbursed for providing care to this population since the start of the year has proven to be so difficult.

“Mid-January is when we realized that our claims aren't getting paid. So that's the first time that we got any idea that there was an issue,” Skinner said.

Spectrum News 1 previously reported the timeline started Jan. 1.

Clinic owners and parents alike expressed dismay at the insurer’s struggle to process claims in a timely fashion earlier this year.

Issues stemmed from a transition to third-party subcontractor PGBA.

A partial statement from Humana Military earlier this year cited that the subcontractor improperly processed Humana Military insurance claims for patients under Tricare East, the health care program designed for military families.

PGBA incorrectly filled provider portals with incorrect information like old addresses, which meant it couldn’t file claims electronically for a long time.

Skinner said as of March, they had received two claims reimbursements from Humana Military insurance with hundreds of other claims left unpaid.

She said they took out a $20,000 loan to stay financially afloat along with firing a team member.

“The worst thing is like literally we're over $50,000 upside down this year, and we had to take out a loan to try to make payroll,” Skinner said. “We're running out of that loan.”

The nutritionist said it's not only affecting the number of patients they see each day, but it's also bleeding into her ability to see those overall because she has picked up more administrative tasks like booking appointments. Skinner said the primary care side can’t perform as many routine health checkups and other services.

“The patients are frustrated with the care not being as good and then the team is frustrated by being stretched so thin,” Skinner said.

Humana spokesperson Nan Frient confirmed advanced checks were mailed to the most vulnerable providers without defining the criteria for vulnerability.

Skinner isn’t a provider who received a check.

In the latest statement, Frient said:

“We acknowledge that our typical timeframes for processing claims have been delayed as a result of this major system transition, however, a very small percentage of claims submitted have gone beyond our contractual payment timeframe of 30 days. Claims have started flowing through the processing systems and payments have begun. We anticipate the remaining issues slowing down our claims processing and payment systems will be fixed by early March.”

A more recent development on the Humana Military website confirmed ongoing issues with processing of claims. A note was shared online on April 17:

“We want to inform you of a recently identified issue involving the incorrect processing of certain claims. Due to a system error, some network provider claims were incorrectly processed as if they were from non-network providers, causing incorrect payments. We are in the process of adjusting the impacted claims for proper payment. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through this as quickly as possible. Once claims have been corrected, an updated Explanation of Benefits (EOB) and remittances will be sent.”

More claims have been paid since the start of the month, but issues remain.

“Me or any other military family, after our service and everything we've done, we're not gonna be able to get quality health care like we used to be able to get, because clinics won't accept our plan because they know it won't pay,” Skinner said.

Skinner said she has received payment for about 45 claims since the start of April but more than 500 claims remain unpaid, including those from January to March.

Some clinic owners chose to tell Tricare-covered families they will have to pay up front for services and file claims on their own.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/medical_supplies_clinic_file_AP,N,-1.0,2025-04-28 18:56:17.961775

At Munson, there is no referral required for physical therapy, to include pelvic floor therapy.","FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas -- A group of military health professionals from Munson Army Health Center recently participated in a one-day continuing education Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Symposium in Overland Park, Kansas designed to enhance their medical readiness skills in rehabilitative musculoskeletal care and orthopedics.

“The event featured a series of expert-led presentations on topics such as shoulder labrum (SLAP) tears and return-to-sport protocols for athletes, ankle rehabilitation, as well as sleep hygiene and nutrition,” said Cpt. Kathryn Marr, a Doctor of Physical Therapy and chief of Munson’s Department of Rehabilitation.

Marr said events like this play a key role in ensuring military medical teams remain ready and on the cutting edge of their healthcare specialties, reinforcing the idea that medicine is a constantly evolving practice to improve patient outcomes.

“Things change. People are always doing research. New information is always coming out, so these events give us the latest evidence-based practices in rehabilitation and performance,” said Marr.

Marr was particularly fascinated with a presentation on a return to running program for patients recovering from stress injuries. She intends to share what she learned with Defense Health Agency peers and incorporate the treatment regimen into the clinic.

Beyond the educational benefits, the event served as a valuable team building and collaboration experience, allowing military and civilian practitioners to learn together and stay aligned on best practices, according to Marr.

The study raises serious concerns about the safety of the dangerous abortion pill.

The analysis, described as the “largest known study of the abortion pill,” was conducted by Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ryan Anderson and Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall.

The authors maintain this is the largest ever study of the abortion pill.

It examined insurance claims data from Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and private insurers, covering 865,727 mifepristone prescriptions dispensed to 692,873 women between 2017 and 2023.

Click here to sign up for pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com

According to the study, approximately 10.9% of these prescriptions—94,605 chemical abortions—resulted in “serious adverse events” such as emergency room visits, hemorrhages, sepsis, infections, or follow-up surgeries within 45 days of taking the drug. This rate starkly contrasts with the FDA’s reported complication rate, which pro-life advocates argue has been dangerously understated.

“The women in our dataset receive (or fail to receive) pre- and post-abortion healthcare of the real-world quality that prevails in the U.S. today, not the carefully controlled regimen of care that ordinarily prevails in a clinical trial,” the study says

“This study is the statistical equivalent of a category 5 hurricane hitting the prevailing narrative of the abortion industry,” Anderson said in a statement to The Federalist. “It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.”

Pro-life medical professionals have long criticized the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, first granted in 2000 under an accelerated process intended for drugs treating serious or life-threatening conditions. Critics, including the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, argue that pregnancy does not qualify as such a condition and that the agency overlooked significant risks to women’s health.

“The FDA should reinstate the original patient safety protocols that were required when mifepristone was first approved. Doing so will likely reduce the harms to women and permit better monitoring to determine whether this drug should remain on the market,” the authors note. “The FDA should further investigate the harm this drug causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether. Women deserve better than the abortion pill.”

The study’s findings come amid ongoing legal and policy battles over mifepristone.

In 2021, the Biden administration relaxed regulations, permanently allowing the dangerous abortion drug to be dispensed via mail and permitting pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS to distribute it. The FDA also reduced oversight, eliminating requirements for prescribers to report non-fatal adverse events unless a patient dies.

Pro-life advocates argue these changes have exacerbated risks, particularly as women can now obtain mifepristone through a single telehealth visit and self-administer it without in-person medical supervision. The study warns that this lack of oversight increases the likelihood of undetected complications, such as ectopic pregnancies or Rh alloimmunization, which can lead to severe bleeding or future pregnancy complications.

Last year, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits of mifepristone’s approval, citing a lack of legal standing for the challenging medical professionals. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion left open the possibility for future challenges, a prospect pro-life groups are pursuing in light of the new data.

The study calls for the FDA to reinstate original safety protocols, such as mandatory in-person visits and adverse event reporting, to better monitor mifepristone’s risks. It also urges a reevaluation of the drug’s approval status.",https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ru48617.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-28 11:56:35.636466

“The increasing dominance of PBMs poses a significant threat to consumers’ convenient access to prescription medications and pharmacy services, while at the same time charging taxpayers excessively and draining limited health care resources in public health programs like Medicare Part D, Medicaid, Tricare and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP),” said NCPA CEO B. Douglas Hoey in a letter to Rachel Riley, senior adviser for HHS.

The letter comes as Congress is considering whether to include PBM reforms in differing spending bills that have passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and must now be reconciled.

Hoey said DOGE should work with CMS to eliminate or significantly tighten up the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.

“We are concerned that pharmacies will have to float the program to the tune of roughly $11,000 per independent pharmacy per week; that pharmacies will not be paid fairly by PBMs; and that manufacturer refund payments to pharmacies will be delayed,” he said. “A recent study found that pharmacies could forfeit an average of $43,000 in annual revenue due to underpayments — roughly equivalent to a pharmacy technician’s yearly salary.”

Hoey cited reports by the Federal Trade Commission and the House Oversight Committee exposing numerous examples of anticompetitive practices that lead to higher drug costs, fewer options for patients and less competition in the retail pharmacy sector.

“It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.” The FDA, the study notes, derived its mifepristone data from 10 clinical trials.
In 2000, the agency used those trials to justify fast-tracking abortion pill approval despite ongoing concerns about dangerous and fatal complications.
When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, the FDA radically relaxed its already debated regulation to permanently allow abortion pills via mail.
Women deserve better than the abortion pill,” the researchers conclude.","Abortion advocates, their allies in the corporate media, and even the U.S. Food and Drug Administration insist the pill responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions is “safe and effective.” A new, wide-ranging analysis of insurance claims regarding the abortion drug regimen, however, found that the rate of life-threatening complications due to mifepristone is at least 22 times higher than what the FDA and Danco Laboratories, manufacturer of mifepristone pill Mifeprex, suggest.

In the “largest known study of the abortion pill,” Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ryan Anderson and Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall used purchased Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare, Department of Veterans Affairs, and private medical insurance claim data to determine that 865,727 mifepristone abortion prescriptions for 692,873 women were handed out between 2017 and 2023.

Approximately 10.9 percent of those claims, or 94,605 chemical abortions, involved potentially life-threatening “serious adverse events” such as emergency room visits, hemorrhage, sepsis, infection, and/or follow-up surgeries for the women who had downed the abortion drug within the last 45 days.

That rate, which researchers adjusted to reflect “that some women suffer from adverse events in multiple categories,” is 22 times the FDA’s <0.5 percent estimation printed on the Mifeprex label. The researchers also suggest that the 45-day timeframe they used is “conservative, as some adverse events may present later (and studies relied on by the FDA used a timeframe as long as 72 days).”

“This study is the statistical equivalent of a category 5 hurricane hitting the prevailing

narrative of the abortion industry,” Anderson said in a statement to The Federalist. “It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.”

The FDA, the study notes, derived its mifepristone data from 10 clinical trials. In 2000, the agency used those trials to justify fast-tracking abortion pill approval despite ongoing concerns about dangerous and fatal complications.

The researchers not only warned that some of those trials are outdated and were conducted outside of the U.S., but they also emphasized the trials only included a fraction — approximately 30,966 hand-selected, “prescreened,” “generally healthy women” — of the mifepristone patients reflected in the insurance data.

“The women in our dataset receive (or fail to receive) pre- and post-abortion healthcare of the real-world quality that prevails in the U.S. today, not the carefully controlled regimen of care that ordinarily prevails in a clinical trial,” the study continues.

For more than two decades, pro-life doctors repeatedly asked the FDA to repeal its approval of the chemical abortion drug due to the life-threatening harm it causes women and babies, as The Federalist previously reported. The FDA repeatedly stonewalled the petitioners despite its legal obligation to address their concerns.

By the time the Obama administration was making its exit in 2016, the agency had worked overtime to expand the abortion pill’s use by changing its dosing, reducing the required number of doctor visits to obtain the drug, allowing more people than licensed doctors to prescribe the pill, and eliminating reporting standards for non-fatal complications from the pills.

When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, the FDA radically relaxed its already debated regulation to permanently allow abortion pills via mail. To further accommodate the Biden White House’s post-Roe activism, the FDA also permitted pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS to dispense mifepristone.

The study notes that as of 2023, a woman can obtain a mifepristone-induced abortion with “as little as one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider (not necessarily a physician)” and “self-administer drugs obtained from a mail-order pharmacy.” Even then, the study warns that a pill prescriber is not mandated to “report any adverse events unless he or she knows that a patient has died.”

“The FDA should reinstate the original patient safety protocols that were required when mifepristone was first approved. Doing so will likely reduce the harms to women and permit better monitoring to determine whether this drug should remain on the market,” the study concludes.

Changes like reinstating multiple in-person office visits, physician-only prescription, ultrasounds to confirm the gestational stage and rule out ectopic pregnancy, and mandated reporting of complications, the study suggests, could spare suffering women severe and even fatal fallout from the pill.

“The FDA should further investigate the harm this drug causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether. Women deserve better than the abortion pill,” the researchers conclude.

Last year the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the merits of the abortion pill’s approval, declaring that the coalition of medical professionals who challenged the Biden administration’s mail-order expansion of the drug did not have legal standing. The opinion penned by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, however, left the door open for the high bench to consider a stronger challenge if one should emerge.

The study authors state that serious adverse events in multiple categories were accounted for in the reported rate.
Changes made to the REMS guidelines under Obama in 2016 and Biden in 2023 weakened safety requirements in order to increase access to the abortion pill.
Today, a woman can order the abortion pill with just one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider and can self-administer mifepristone that she obtains through a mail-order pharmacy.
Prescribers of mifepristone no longer need to report any adverse events unless a patient dies after the administration of the drug.","A new, first-of-its-kind study asserts that serious adverse events from mifepristone, the first drug in the abortion pill regimen, occur at a rate approximately 22 times higher than the rate reported on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) label for the drug.

The study, “The Abortion Pill Harms Women,” published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), states that nearly 11% of women (10.93%) experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or other serious or life-threatening adverse events following a mifepristone abortion. This means one in ten women experience at least one serious complication from taking mifepristone within 45 days — 22 times higher than the “less than 0.5 percent” serious adverse events rate reported by the FDA on the mifepristone label, according to this study. The study authors state that serious adverse events in multiple categories were accounted for in the reported rate.

The study examines the largest dataset to date regarding the abortion pill’s serious adverse events and is based on a HIPAA-compliant analysis of an insurance claims database that includes private health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Researchers state that they reviewed 865,727 prescribed mifepristone abortions that took place from 2017 to 2023, following the official FDA definition of “serious adverse event” when reviewing the data. This dataset is 28 times larger than the combined 10 clinical trials upon which the FDA relied upon for the drug’s labeled risk.

The researchers also point out that “The data excludes transactions for which the insurer is also the provider (as is the case with some HMOs and much VA care), as well as cash pay transactions (which are disproportionately common for abortion).”

“Simply stated, mifepristone, as used in real-world conditions, is not ‘safe and effective,'” the study’s authors stated.

The current FDA-approved drug label warning is based on the results of 10 clinical trials that included just 30,966 women, 0.5% of whom reported serious adverse reactions. Some of those trials date as far back as 1983.

Significantly, EPPC noted that the women in the large insurance database it used for its study were “not a prescreened group of generally healthy women recruited into various clinical trials conducted at different times around the world.”

Study authors, EPPC Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall and EPPC President Ryan T. Anderson, are calling on the FDA to revisit its previous research on mifepristone and reconsider the current regulation of mifepristone, which was scaled back substantially under the Obama and Biden administrations.

Anderson stated that the study “reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.” In the summary of the study, the authors recommend: “The FDA should immediately reinstate its earlier, stronger patient safety protocols to ensure physician responsibility for women who take mifepristone under their care, as well as mandate full reporting of its side effects,” and “The FDA should further investigate the harm mifepristone causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether.”

While Planned Parenthood claims the abortion pill is “safer than many other medicines like penicillin, Tylenol, and Viagra,” a study conducted by pro-abortion group Gynuity, released in 2021, found that 6% of women who took the abortion pill required a visit to the ER or urgent care for complications. That’s 107 times greater than the rate for acetaminophen/Tylenol (.056%) based on this analysis, and 33 times greater than the rate for penicillin (0.18%) based on this analysis. When compared to the new research from EPPC showing a 10.93% “serious adverse event” rate for the abortion pill, it becomes even more evident that Planned Parenthood’s claim is false.

Mifepristone was first approved for use as the abortion pill RU-486 in the United States in 2000 under the Bill Clinton administration, with several safety regulations in place. It was approved for up to seven weeks under the original Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which stated that women taking the abortion pill must have three in-person visits with the prescriber, who had to be a medical doctor. Mifepristone could only be administered in a clinic, medical office, or hospital under the supervision of a physician who was able to assess the gestational age of the child and diagnose an ectopic pregnancy.

Changes made to the REMS guidelines under Obama in 2016 and Biden in 2023 weakened safety requirements in order to increase access to the abortion pill.

Today, a woman can order the abortion pill with just one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider and can self-administer mifepristone that she obtains through a mail-order pharmacy.

Complaints from military families increased back in January when their health benefits switched from Humana to TriWest.

It's not unusual for benefits to change year to year but more often than not, the transition is smooth.

The rocky transition is not only generating complaints from military families, even service providers report having issues with TriWest.

Britt Sims owns and operates integrated behavior solutions in San Antonio, providing service to children and teens with autism. 90 percent of his clients have coverage with TriWest. Because of problems with TriWest, he says he's had to take out loans to keep his doors open.

After our report, TriWest responded with a statement that reads in full:

At TriWest Healthcare Alliance, there is no greater honor than helping our nation’s heroes get the health care they have earned. Paying provider claims accurately and quickly is a top priority at TriWest. To date, TriWest has processed more than $6 million TRICARE claims totaling $830 million, including 167,000 Autism claims – a particular area of focus for TriWest. We are actively processing and paying claims for dates of service in 2025, when we began administering the TRICARE program in 26 western states. As challenges with referrals, authorizations or claims arise, our dedicated team is working diligently to resolve any issues impacting beneficiaries and providers. TriWest is confident in our ability to get this right because of our long, successful partnership with VA. On average, we pay VA community care provider claims within 3 to 5 days to 99 percent accuracy. We are committed to reaching this same level of efficiency and accuracy for TRICARE providers.

Meanwhile, we are working to get answers on this still developing story including:

When will providers who took out loans to keep providing services to military families be paid the money they say they're owed?

When it comes to plans to address concerns, we're working to find out just how many people are on the TriWest resolution team?

How large are their individual case loads?

When can military families expect things to be fully resolved?

One effective way to determine which Tricare plan to bill for different patients is to verify the patient's eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). This system provides up-to-date information on a patient's enrollment status and the specific Tricare plan they are eligible for. Tricare is a healthcare benefit program for military personnel in all seven uniformed branches, and eligibility requires enrollment in DEERS.1

Steps to Verify Eligibility:

Collect the patient's personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, Social Security number).

Access DEERS to check the patient's enrollment status.

Identify the specific Tricare plan (e.g., Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare for Life) based on their eligibility.

Scenario for Tricare for Life Eligibility

A patient would be eligible for the Tricare for Life plan if they meet the following criteria:

They are a Medicare-eligible retiree or a dependent of a retiree.

They are enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Example Scenario:

A retired service member turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare. Since they have both Medicare Parts A and B, they are now eligible for Tricare for Life, which acts as a secondary payer to Medicare.2 Tricare for Life is specifically designed for retirees eligible for Medicare, providing coverage for coinsurance and deductibles.3

Billing for Injured Active Duty Service Member

If an active duty service member is injured on the job, you would bill Workers' Compensation rather than Tricare.

Explanation:

Active duty service members are covered under the military's health care system, but injuries sustained while on duty are typically addressed through the military's own processes or Workers' Compensation.4 Billing Workers' Compensation ensures that the costs associated with the injury are covered appropriately, as it is designed to handle work-related injuries. This is because Workers' Compensation is specifically structured to cover medical expenses and lost wages due to work-related injuries, ensuring that the financial burden does not fall on the service member or their family.5

Medicaid

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals and families. Here are some key points:

Eligibility: Varies by state, but generally includes low-income families, pregnant women, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities. States have the flexibility to expand coverage beyond federal requirements, which can lead to variations in eligibility and benefits across states. The Affordable Care Act has allowed states to receive federal assistance to expand Medicaid coverage to more individuals who were previously ineligible.1

Coverage: Includes a range of services such as hospital visits, doctor visits, long-term care, and preventive services. Medicaid benefits are comprehensive and include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, and more.2

Cost: Typically low or no cost for eligible individuals, with some states charging nominal fees. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal and state governments, with states having the discretion to determine the scope and cost of services.3

Tricare

Tricare is a health care program for military personnel, retirees, and their dependents. Key features include:

Eligibility: Available to active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, and their families. Tricare is designed to provide global coverage, which is essential for families stationed abroad or moving frequently.3

Coverage: Offers comprehensive health care services, including medical, dental, and mental health care. Tricare provides a variety of plans, such as Tricare Prime and Tricare Select, each with different coverage and cost structures.2

Plans: Various options such as Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, and Tricare for Life, each with different coverage and cost structures. Tricare requires enrollees to be treated at military facilities unless prior approval is obtained for treatment at civilian facilities.1

Worker’s Compensation

Worker’s compensation is a form of insurance that provides financial benefits to employees who suffer job-related injuries or illnesses. Here are the main aspects:

Purpose: To cover medical expenses and provide wage replacement for injured workers. It is designed to eliminate the need for employees to sue employers for negligence related to workplace injuries.4

Eligibility: Generally applies to employees who are injured or become ill due to their job. Employers are required to fund this insurance, and employees are not required to contribute to the cost.5

Benefits: May include medical treatment, rehabilitation, and compensation for lost wages. The benefits and coverage can vary by state, as worker’s compensation is a state-run program.6

Comparison Table

Feature Medicaid Tricare Worker’s Compensation Eligibility Low-income individuals/families Military personnel and families Employees with job-related injuries Coverage Comprehensive health services Comprehensive military health care Medical expenses and wage replacement Cost Low or no cost Varies by plan Employer-funded

Conclusion

Understanding the differences between Medicaid, Tricare, and worker’s compensation is essential for navigating health care options and benefits. Each program serves distinct populations and offers various services tailored to their needs. Medicaid and Tricare are both government-funded programs, but they cater to different groups and have different structures and requirements. Worker’s compensation, on the other hand, is a state-mandated insurance program funded by employers to protect employees from job-related injuries and illnesses.

Transition to a Payor-focused model and expansions of networks like Medicare and TRICARE promise revenue growth and improved profitability through a stable customer base.

AI-driven technologies and operational efficiencies enhance member engagement and reduce costs, leading to improved net margins and increased earnings.

Focus on Payor models and tech investments poses profitability and growth risks amid declining consumer revenue and marketing challenges.

Catalysts

About Talkspace

Operates as a virtual behavioral healthcare company that connects patients with licensed mental health providers in the United States.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

Expansion to Medicare and TRICARE networks will unlock coverage for significant new populations, potentially increasing revenue due to a broader customer base.

The shift from a consumer subscription model to a Payor-focused approach has increased coverage to 179 million people, which is likely to enhance revenue growth and improve net margins due to a more predictable and scale-efficient business model.

The development and implementation of AI-driven technologies, such as Talkcast and other tools to improve the member journey, can enhance member engagement and retention, potentially boosting revenue and net margins by decreasing churn and increasing utilization rates.

Operational efficiencies, such as a decrease in operating expenses and an overall increase in the effectiveness of marketing spend, should improve net margins and earnings.

Strategic partnerships and marketing initiatives focused on covered life populations, like the military and Medicare recipients, are anticipated to enhance revenue growth and sustained profitability due to higher return on investment in these targeted marketing efforts.

Talkspace Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

Analysts are assuming Talkspace's revenue will grow by 21.4% annually over the next 3 years.

Analysts assume that profit margins will increase from 0.6% today to 11.4% in 3 years time.

Analysts expect earnings to reach $38.1 million (and earnings per share of $0.19) by about April 2028, up from $1.1 million today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the analysts price target, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 25.8x on those 2028 earnings, down from 457.8x today. This future PE is greater than the current PE for the US Healthcare industry at 23.8x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to decline by 0.74% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 6.21%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Talkspace Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The shift towards a Payor-focused model and the resulting decline in gross margins may pose a risk to overall profitability, as the company navigates the trade-off between lower gross margins and the anticipated long-term benefits of improved unit economics.

Decreasing consumer revenue, as Talkspace focuses on Payor and DTE models, could negatively impact top-line growth if Payor-based strategies do not expand as projected, affecting revenue growth and market penetration.

Challenges in marketing strategies, particularly reaching new segments like Medicare and military populations, could lead to inefficient spend and slower user acquisition, impacting revenue growth.

Potential pricing pressures in negotiations with Payors, if they were to arise, could influence revenue levels negatively, despite current stable pricing conditions.

Heavy reliance on technologies to improve member retention and engagement may not yield expected results, which could adversely affect earnings by not generating sufficient return on investment in technological enhancements.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The analysts have a consensus price target of $5.0 for Talkspace based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors.

In order for you to agree with the analyst's consensus, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $335.8 million, earnings will come to $38.1 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 25.8x, assuming you use a discount rate of 6.2%.

Given the current share price of $3.12, the analyst price target of $5.0 is 37.6% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.
