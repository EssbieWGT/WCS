The question of whether you can work while receiving outpatient rehab with TRICARE West in Orange County isn’t just about logistics—it’s about hope, healing, and maintaining the dignity that comes with providing for your family during one of life’s most challenging periods.

The reality is that outpatient rehab while working TRICARE West Orange County is not only possible but often the most practical path to recovery for military families. Throughout my career treating thousands of service members and veterans across Orange County, I’ve seen how the flexibility of outpatient programs can be the difference between someone seeking help and suffering in silence. This comprehensive guide will provide you with everything you need to know about balancing your professional responsibilities with your recovery journey in Orange County.

Understanding TRICARE West Outpatient Treatment Options in Orange County

TRICARE West flexible outpatient treatment Orange County offers several levels of care designed specifically to accommodate the unique needs of working military personnel in the region. Unlike the rigid schedules often associated with residential treatment, outpatient programs throughout Orange County provide the flexibility that allows you to maintain your career while receiving comprehensive addiction treatment.

The beauty of outpatient care in Orange County lies in its adaptability. Whether you’re an active-duty service member stationed at local military installations with demanding military obligations, a veteran transitioning to civilian employment in Orange County, or a military spouse juggling multiple responsibilities, there’s likely an outpatient program structure that can work with your schedule rather than against it.

Types of Outpatient Programs Available in Orange County

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) represent the most structured form of outpatient care, typically requiring 9-15 hours of treatment per week spread across three to four days. These programs are ideal for individuals who need significant support but cannot commit to residential treatment due to work or family obligations. Many facilities throughout Orange County, including Asana Recovery, offer multiple IOP tracks throughout the week, allowing you to choose times that align with your work schedule.

Standard Outpatient Treatment involves fewer hours per week—typically 3-6 hours—and offers the greatest flexibility for working individuals in Orange County. This level of care works well for those in early recovery who have already completed more intensive treatment or for individuals whose addiction severity doesn’t require intensive intervention.

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) offer the most intensive outpatient option, requiring 4-6 hours of treatment per day, several days per week. While this level requires more time commitment, many PHPs in Orange County offer both morning and evening tracks to accommodate different work schedules.

Military Outpatient Rehab Scheduling Orange County: Making It Work

Military outpatient rehab scheduling Orange County requires strategic planning, but with proper coordination, it’s entirely manageable. The key is understanding that recovery isn’t a one-size-fits-all process, and treatment centers throughout Orange County that specialize in military populations understand the unique demands you face.

In my experience working with military families throughout Orange County, the most successful treatment arrangements often involve a combination of flexibility from both the treatment center and the individual’s workplace. Many TRICARE-approved addiction treatment facilities in Orange County offer multiple program tracks throughout the day and week, including early morning sessions before traditional work hours, evening programs after standard business hours, and weekend intensive sessions.

Creating Your Treatment Schedule in Orange County

The process begins with an honest assessment of your work obligations and identifying windows of opportunity for treatment. Most successful participants in working during addiction treatment military Orange County programs follow these strategies:

Early Morning Programs: Many Orange County facilities offer 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM sessions, allowing you to complete treatment before reporting to duty. This option works particularly well for military personnel accustomed to early morning physical training and formations.

Evening Sessions: Programs running from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM accommodate traditional work schedules and are among the most popular options for working individuals in Orange County. These sessions allow you to maintain your regular work routine while prioritizing your recovery in the evening hours.

Weekend Intensives: Some individuals prefer concentrating their treatment into weekend sessions, attending longer sessions on Saturdays and Sundays while maintaining their full work schedule during the week.

TRICARE West Evening Outpatient Programs Orange County: A Detailed Look

TRICARE West evening outpatient programs Orange County have revolutionized addiction treatment accessibility for working military families in the region. These programs typically run from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, three to four evenings per week, providing comprehensive treatment without interfering with daytime work responsibilities.

Evening programs in Orange County aren’t simply daytime curricula shifted to later hours. They’re specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by working individuals in recovery. Group sessions often focus on workplace stress management, maintaining sobriety in professional environments, and balancing recovery priorities with career advancement.

The therapeutic community that develops in Orange County evening programs often includes individuals from similar professional backgrounds, creating peer support networks that understand the specific challenges of maintaining sobriety while advancing military careers. I’ve observed that participants in Orange County evening programs often form some of the strongest long-term recovery networks, bound by their shared experience of prioritizing recovery while maintaining professional responsibilities.

Evidence-Based Treatment in Orange County Evening Programs

Evening TRICARE West outpatient work schedule Orange County programs incorporate the same evidence-based treatments available in traditional daytime programs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), trauma-informed care, and medication-assisted treatment (when appropriate) are all available in evening formats throughout Orange County.

Group therapy sessions in Orange County evening programs often address workplace-specific triggers and stressors. Participants learn practical strategies for managing cravings during work hours, handling work-related stress without substances, and maintaining professional relationships while in recovery.

Individual therapy sessions can often be scheduled during lunch breaks or immediately after work, providing personalized support that complements group programming. Many therapists in Orange County specializing in military populations understand the importance of flexibility and will work with your schedule to ensure consistency in individual treatment.

Part-Time Rehab TRICARE West Orange County: Flexible Options for Every Schedule

Part-time rehab TRICARE West Orange County options recognize that not everyone can commit to intensive daily programming. These flexible arrangements allow individuals to gradually increase their treatment engagement or maintain ongoing support while managing full-time work responsibilities.

Part-time programs in Orange County might involve attending two group sessions per week, weekly individual therapy, and monthly psychiatry appointments for medication management. This approach works particularly well for individuals in early recovery who have completed more intensive treatment or for those whose work schedules are unpredictable.

The success of part-time programming often depends on developing strong coping strategies and support networks outside of formal treatment hours. Participants learn to utilize peer support networks, online recovery resources, and self-care practices to maintain their recovery momentum between sessions.

Building Recovery Skills Around Your Orange County Work Schedule

Military addiction treatment flexible hours Orange County programs teach practical skills that can be implemented during work hours. Mindfulness techniques that can be practiced during brief breaks, stress management strategies for high-pressure situations, and communication skills for maintaining healthy workplace relationships are all essential components of flexible programming.

Many participants develop “recovery toolkits” for their workplace environments. These might include discrete stress-relief techniques, supportive contact lists, and strategies for politely declining work-related social events that involve alcohol. The goal is to create a sustainable recovery framework that enhances rather than compromises professional performance.

Outpatient IOP While Working Military Orange County: Intensive Support with Flexibility

Outpatient IOP while working military Orange County positions represent one of the most effective treatment models for service members who need substantial support but cannot leave their duties for residential treatment. Intensive Outpatient Programs typically require 9-15 hours of programming per week, strategically scheduled to minimize work disruption.

The structure of military-focused IOPs in Orange County recognizes that service members often have demanding and unpredictable schedules. Many programs offer multiple tracks throughout the week, allowing participants to make up missed sessions and maintain program requirements even when military duties conflict with scheduled treatment times.

IOPs provide the clinical intensity needed to address serious addiction issues while respecting the reality that military careers cannot simply be put on hold. The comprehensive nature of these programs—including group therapy, individual counseling, family therapy, and psychiatric services—ensures that participants receive thorough treatment without residential placement.

Military Culture Integration in Orange County IOP

Effective active duty outpatient rehab TRICARE Orange County programs understand and respect military culture while challenging aspects of that culture that may contribute to substance use. The warrior mentality that serves military personnel well in combat situations can sometimes hinder recovery by promoting self-reliance over help-seeking behavior.

Quality IOPs in Orange County help participants reframe seeking treatment as a demonstration of strength and commitment rather than weakness. They integrate military values of discipline, mission accomplishment, and teamwork into the recovery process, showing how these same values support long-term sobriety.

Group dynamics in military-focused IOPs often mirror the camaraderie and mutual support found in military units. Participants support each other through challenging times, celebrate recovery milestones together, and maintain accountability relationships that extend beyond formal programming hours.

TRICARE West Weekend Outpatient Programs Orange County: Maximizing Recovery Time

TRICARE West weekend outpatient programs Orange County offer an innovative solution for individuals whose weekday work schedules make traditional programming impossible. These intensive weekend sessions allow participants to receive comprehensive treatment while maintaining full-time employment during the week.

Weekend programs in Orange County typically involve longer sessions—often 4-6 hours on both Saturday and Sunday—to provide the clinical hours needed for effective treatment. While the time commitment is significant, many working individuals find this schedule preferable to trying to fit treatment around weekday work obligations.

The community aspect of weekend programs is particularly strong, as participants share the experience of sacrificing personal time for recovery. This shared commitment often creates powerful therapeutic bonds and long-lasting support networks throughout Orange County.

Family Integration in Orange County Weekend Programs

Weekend programming creates unique opportunities for military family outpatient treatment scheduling Orange County and family involvement in the recovery process. Many programs offer concurrent family sessions, allowing family members to participate in the treatment process without missing work or school.

Children and spouses can attend family education sessions, learning about addiction as a disease and developing skills to support their loved one’s recovery. These sessions also address the impact of addiction on family dynamics and provide strategies for healing relationships damaged by substance use.

Weekend family sessions often include recreational therapy and activities that demonstrate how families can have fun together in sobriety. These experiences help family members envision a positive future in recovery and provide practical examples of sober socializing.

Managing Work Responsibilities During Treatment in Orange County

Successfully balancing employment with outpatient treatment requires strategic planning and clear communication with supervisors when appropriate. Military outpatient rehab employer confidentiality Orange County protections ensure that your treatment information remains private, but practical considerations around scheduling and time management require careful planning.

Many successful participants develop time management systems that allow them to maintain high performance at work while prioritizing recovery activities. This might involve arriving at work earlier to leave on time for evening sessions, using lunch breaks for therapy appointments, or batch-processing work tasks to create blocks of time for treatment activities.

Professional Performance During Recovery

One concern many individuals have about working full time during TRICARE West treatment Orange County is whether their job performance will suffer. In my experience, most people find that their work performance actually improves as they progress in recovery. Clearer thinking, better sleep, improved emotional regulation, and reduced anxiety often lead to enhanced professional effectiveness.

However, early recovery can present challenges. Fatigue from withdrawal, emotional ups and downs, and the time commitment of treatment can temporarily impact work performance. Quality treatment programs in Orange County help participants develop strategies to manage these challenges while maintaining professional standards.

Many programs include career counseling and workplace stress management as standard components. Participants learn to identify and manage work-related triggers, develop healthy boundaries between work and personal life, and create sustainable career advancement strategies that support long-term recovery.

Legal Protections and Workplace Rights

Understanding your legal protections is crucial when working during addiction treatment military Orange County settings. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provide important protections for individuals seeking addiction treatment, though military applications can be complex.

Military FMLA addiction treatment Orange County protections may apply differently to active-duty personnel versus civilian employees, and it’s important to understand your specific rights and protections. Many treatment centers have patient advocates who can help explain your rights and assist with workplace accommodations when necessary.

Confidentiality Protections

Military outpatient rehab employer confidentiality Orange County is protected by federal law, but understanding the specifics of these protections helps you make informed decisions about disclosure. Generally, your employer cannot access your medical treatment information without your explicit consent, but there may be exceptions for certain military positions or security clearances.

Many successful participants choose to have candid conversations with trusted supervisors about their treatment, finding that honesty leads to support and accommodation rather than professional consequences. However, this decision is highly personal and should be made carefully with guidance from treatment professionals and possibly legal counsel.

TRICARE West outpatient work schedule Orange County accommodations don’t require special approval or additional documentation beyond standard outpatient treatment authorization. Your benefits cover the same range of services whether you attend morning, evening, or weekend sessions.

It’s important to understand your specific coverage limits, copayment responsibilities, and any annual maximums that might apply to your treatment. Most treatment centers in Orange County provide detailed benefits verification before beginning treatment, ensuring you understand your financial responsibilities upfront.

Creating a Sustainable Recovery Plan

Long-term success in veteran outpatient rehab work balance Orange County requires more than just attending treatment sessions. It involves creating comprehensive lifestyle changes that support recovery while advancing professional goals. This means developing new routines, building supportive relationships, and learning to manage stress in healthy ways.

Successful recovery planning addresses both immediate treatment needs and long-term lifestyle goals. This might involve career planning that considers recovery priorities, developing financial strategies that reduce stress, and building social networks that support sobriety.

Integrating Recovery into Career Goals

Many participants discover that recovery actually enhances their career prospects by improving their reliability, emotional stability, and interpersonal skills. Treatment programs help individuals identify how their recovery goals align with professional aspirations and develop strategies to advance both simultaneously.

This might involve pursuing education or training that was previously impossible due to substance use, developing leadership skills through recovery program participation, or exploring career paths that provide greater life satisfaction and stress management.

Technology and Virtual Treatment Options

Modern TRICARE West outpatient treatment Orange County increasingly incorporates technology to provide greater flexibility for working individuals. Telehealth services, mobile apps for recovery support, and online group sessions provide additional options for maintaining treatment engagement despite demanding work schedules.

Virtual therapy sessions can often be scheduled during lunch breaks or immediately after work, reducing travel time and providing greater scheduling flexibility. While virtual services don’t replace all in-person programming, they provide valuable supplemental support for working individuals.

Digital Recovery Tools

Many programs now incorporate smartphone apps that provide recovery tracking, craving management tools, and peer support networks. These tools allow individuals to access recovery support throughout their workday, providing immediate assistance when challenges arise.

Digital tools also facilitate communication with treatment teams, allowing for quick check-ins, appointment scheduling, and crisis support without requiring phone calls during work hours.

Family Support and Treatment Coordination

Military family outpatient treatment scheduling Orange County often involves coordinating treatment for multiple family members while managing various work and school schedules. Many quality treatment programs offer family sessions that accommodate different scheduling needs and provide multiple ways for family members to participate in the recovery process.

Family involvement significantly improves treatment outcomes, and programs designed for military families understand the unique challenges of coordinating multiple schedules around military commitments. This might involve evening family sessions, weekend family intensives, or virtual family meetings that allow remote participation.

Supporting Military Spouses in Orange County

Military spouses in Orange County face unique challenges in accessing treatment while managing family responsibilities and often variable work schedules due to frequent relocations. Programs specializing in military families provide specific support for spouses, understanding the additional stressors they face.

Spouse-specific programming might address isolation, frequent relocations, single parenting during deployments, and the challenges of building support networks in new communities. These programs recognize that military spouses often sacrifice their own career development for family stability and provide support for both recovery and personal growth.

Measuring Success in Flexible Treatment Programs

Success in outpatient rehab while working TRICARE West Orange County programs is measured not just by abstinence from substances but by overall life improvement including work performance, family relationships, physical health, and emotional well-being. Quality programs use comprehensive outcome measures that reflect the full range of recovery benefits.

Regular assessment helps ensure that treatment intensity and scheduling continue to meet your changing needs. As recovery progresses, many individuals find they need less intensive programming, allowing for greater focus on career advancement and personal goals.

Long-term Recovery Planning

Successful programs don’t just focus on immediate sobriety but help participants develop long-term recovery maintenance strategies. This includes identifying ongoing support needs, developing relapse prevention plans, and creating sustainable lifestyle patterns that support both recovery and professional success.

Long-term planning often involves transitioning from intensive programming to ongoing maintenance care, developing independent recovery skills, and building support networks that will provide assistance long after formal treatment concludes.

Most quality treatment centers offer multiple scheduling options including early morning sessions (6-9 AM), evening programs (6-9 PM), and weekend intensives that allow you to maintain your full-time employment while receiving comprehensive addiction treatment.

How many hours per week is outpatient rehab with TRICARE West in Orange County?

Outpatient treatment hours vary based on the level of care you need. Standard outpatient treatment typically involves 3-6 hours per week, while Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) require 9-15 hours weekly.

Your treatment team will work with you to determine the appropriate level of care based on your specific needs and work schedule constraints.

Can I do outpatient rehab on weekends with TRICARE West in Orange County?

Yes, many TRICARE-approved facilities in Orange County offer weekend outpatient programs specifically designed for working individuals. These programs typically involve longer sessions on Saturdays and Sundays (4-6 hours each day) to provide the clinical hours needed for effective treatment while allowing you to maintain your weekday work schedule. Weekend programs often create strong peer support networks among participants who share similar scheduling challenges.

How do I balance my military job with outpatient addiction treatment in Orange County?

Balancing military duties with treatment requires strategic planning and clear communication with your treatment team about your military obligations. Most successful service members develop time management systems, utilize early morning or evening treatment slots, and work with supervisors (when appropriate) to ensure they can meet both military and treatment commitments. Quality treatment programs in Orange County understand military culture and scheduling demands, offering flexibility when military duties conflict with scheduled sessions.

What are the typical hours for TRICARE West outpatient programs in Orange County?

Most TRICARE West outpatient programs in Orange County offer multiple scheduling options: early morning sessions (6:00-9:00 AM), traditional daytime hours (9:00 AM-5:00 PM), evening programs (6:00-9:00 PM), and weekend intensives. Many facilities offer the same program content across different time slots, allowing you to choose the schedule that best fits your work obligations without compromising treatment quality.

Can active duty personnel work while in outpatient rehab in Orange County?

Active duty personnel can and often do work while participating in outpatient rehabilitation in Orange County. Military commands generally support service members seeking treatment, and many installations have specific policies supporting treatment participation. The key is coordinating with your chain of command and treatment providers to ensure both military duties and treatment requirements can be met. Most active duty participants find that their work performance actually improves as they progress in recovery.

Do I have to tell my employer about outpatient rehab treatment?

You are not legally required to disclose your addiction treatment to your employer. Medical information, including addiction treatment, is protected by federal privacy laws (HIPAA). However, some individuals choose to have honest conversations with trusted supervisors to facilitate scheduling accommodations or explain any temporary performance changes. This decision should be made carefully with guidance from your treatment team and consideration of your specific workplace culture.

Is outpatient addiction treatment confidential for military members in Orange County?

Yes, addiction treatment is confidential for military members in Orange County under the same federal privacy protections (HIPAA) that apply to all medical treatment. Your treatment information cannot be shared with your command or employer without your explicit written consent. However, there may be specific considerations for certain security clearances or positions that require medical disclosure, which should be discussed with your treatment provider and possibly legal counsel.

Can my command find out about my TRICARE West rehab treatment?

Your command cannot access your TRICARE West treatment information without your written consent. Medical privacy laws protect addiction treatment information, and TRICARE cannot share treatment details with military commands. However, if you need time off for treatment or if treatment impacts your duty performance, you may need to have conversations with your supervisors about accommodations without necessarily disclosing specific treatment details.

What are my rights regarding addiction treatment privacy at work?

You have strong privacy rights regarding addiction treatment information. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides workplace protections for individuals in recovery, and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) may provide job protection for treatment time. Your employer cannot discriminate against you for seeking treatment, and they cannot access your medical information without your consent. However, you may need to request reasonable accommodations for treatment scheduling.

How does FMLA work for military outpatient addiction treatment?

FMLA protections may apply to civilian military employees and some military family members, providing up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for serious health conditions including addiction treatment. However, FMLA applications for active duty personnel are complex and may not apply in the same way. Military personnel should consult with their command’s legal office and treatment providers to understand their specific protections and options.

Can I get time off work for TRICARE West therapy appointments?

Many employers, including military commands, provide reasonable accommodations for medical appointments including therapy sessions. While you may not be entitled to unlimited time off, most employers will work with you to schedule essential medical care. Some individuals use lunch breaks, personal time, or flexible scheduling arrangements to attend therapy appointments without impacting their work responsibilities.

How long does outpatient rehab last with TRICARE West coverage?

Outpatient treatment duration varies based on individual needs, but most programs last 3-6 months for initial treatment, with many individuals continuing in less intensive maintenance care for a year or more. TRICARE West doesn’t impose arbitrary time limits on medically necessary treatment, and coverage continues as long as treatment remains clinically appropriate. Your treatment team will regularly assess your progress and adjust treatment intensity and duration accordingly.

Can I choose my therapy times with TRICARE West outpatient programs in Orange County?

Most TRICARE-approved outpatient programs in Orange County offer multiple scheduling options, allowing you to choose times that work best with your schedule. While you may not have unlimited flexibility, quality programs typically offer morning, afternoon, evening, and weekend options. When you begin treatment, you can discuss your scheduling needs with the treatment team to find the best fit for your work and family obligations.

What happens if I miss work for addiction treatment appointments?

Missing work for legitimate medical appointments, including addiction treatment, is generally protected under workplace policies and federal law. Most employers have policies for medical leave, and addiction treatment qualifies as medical care. You should communicate with your supervisor about your medical needs (without necessarily disclosing specific details) and work together to minimize work disruption while ensuring you receive necessary care.

Does TRICARE West require prior authorization for outpatient rehab in Orange County?

Yes, TRICARE West typically requires prior authorization for outpatient addiction treatment beyond initial assessment sessions. However, most quality treatment providers in Orange County handle the authorization process for you, working directly with TRICARE to ensure approval before treatment begins. The authorization process usually takes 1-3 business days and considers medical necessity, appropriate level of care, and treatment provider qualifications.

Can military spouses work while attending outpatient treatment in Orange County?

Absolutely. Military spouses can and do work while participating in outpatient treatment programs in Orange County. Many treatment centers offer scheduling options specifically designed for working individuals, including evening and weekend programs. Military spouses often benefit from the structure that work provides during recovery, and treatment programs help develop strategies for managing both work responsibilities and recovery priorities.

Are virtual therapy sessions covered by TRICARE West for working people?

Yes, TRICARE West covers telehealth and virtual therapy sessions under the same coverage terms as in-person sessions. Virtual sessions can provide additional scheduling flexibility for working individuals, allowing therapy appointments during lunch breaks or immediately after work without travel time. While virtual services don’t replace all in-person programming, they provide valuable supplemental support and increased accessibility for busy schedules.

How do I explain treatment absences to my military supervisor?

You can explain treatment-related absences as medical appointments without disclosing specific details about addiction treatment. Many service members simply state they have ongoing medical treatment that requires regular appointments. If you choose to be more specific, you can focus on the health and performance benefits of treatment rather than the specific condition being treated. Your treatment team can provide guidance on workplace communication strategies.

The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe.
The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare.
The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility.
The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel.","Although the Defense Authorization Act signed by former President Biden blocks the U.S. Military’s healthcare system from providing specialized treatments to the transgender children of service members, three families are suing the Department of Defense (DOD) to reinstate the benefit, claiming they have been left with “significant” and “crushing out-of-pocket costs.” Leftist groups were outraged when the measure passed late last year and called on Biden to veto it because it bans the military’s Tricare Health Plan from covering gender-affirming care such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants to treat “gender dysphoria.” An analysis cited by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a leader in the campaign opposing the military’s transgender healthcare ban, estimates that 2,500 minor patients receive care for gender dysphoria through Tricare and 900 get puberty-suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.

In their lawsuit against the DOD military personnel with transgender children claim that Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm and that plaintiffs’ families now face significant and crushing out-of-pocket costs. “This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country,” according to the complaint filed this month by two LGBTQ+ rights groups on behalf of the families. The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe. The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare. The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility. Without Tricare coverage the testosterone prescription is “too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the complaint states, adding that the “process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

Servicemembers and their families have been able to obtain puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone therapy for their transgender children through the military insurance for nearly a decade, one of the LGBTQ+ groups that filed the lawsuit writes in a statement that blames President Trump for ordering the DOD to terminate the essential care. “As a result of the Trump administration’s directive, the families’ trusted doctors cannot provide ongoing care and families are unfairly forced to take on this financial burden,” according to the group, which accuses the Trump administration of waging a relentless assault on transgender Americans and issuing a barrage of discriminatory executive orders designed to strip away their basic legal rights and deny them recognition. The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel. Leftist groups like the ACLU mounted a campaign to pressure Biden to veto the bill, but he signed it even though it prohibits insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria,” including the hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants taken by the minors in this lawsuit.",https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JW_2025Template_CorruptionChronicles-Logo_09.12_1200x627_v1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-12 19:56:06.880487

The annual symposium, widely regarded as the premier event for military medical research, serves as a collaborative venue for military medical experts to exchange knowledge and advance health care initiatives tailored to the unique needs of the Warfighter. It brings together military providers with deployment experience, academic scientists, international partners, and industry representatives to address key topics such as combat casualty care, military operational medicine, clinical and rehabilitative medicine, information sciences, military infectious diseases, and radiation health effects.

Purpose and Participation

Many shared insights emphasizing the importance of attending MHSRS for purposes of outreach, networking and collaboration.

“For me, MHSRS was about networking and expanding the virology division’s reach,” said Kathleen Huie, program manager for USAMRIID’s Virology Division. “It gave me the chance to meet new collaborators and strengthen existing partnerships.”

Those partnerships were improved by the kinds of personal interactions that are only possible at an in-person event.

“Face-to-face interaction is invaluable; I was able to connect with people I’ve been emailing for months but had never met in person,” said Huie.

Huie also highlighted her involvement in an internal USAMRIID initiative, which is focused on strengthening reach back and outreach responsiveness to operational forces in support of medical biological threat defense.

“The symposium allowed me to showcase our operational response capabilities and engage with various commands and organizations,” she explained.

Huie emphasized the importance of utilizing the exhibits to network and draw in potential collaborators.

“Several companies presented innovative ideas and products at their booths that could align with our mission,” said Huie. “I’m hopeful we can test and integrate some of these technologies into our biodefense efforts.”

David Rozak, director of USAMRIID’s Biodefense Reference Material Repository and chief of the Regulated Products Branch, echoed this sentiment, adding, the symposium allowed him to see how USAMRIID’s work fits into the broader scope of military health and force protection.

“It’s about connecting the dots and finding ways to enhance our contributions,” said Rozak. “The contacts I made at the symposium, including a representative from an overseas lab, could help us expand these capabilities further.”

Presentations and Sessions

USAMRIID scientists actively contributed to the symposium through poster presentations and session discussions, including Rozak, who presented a poster on the Global Emergency Assay Response System, or GEARS.

Rozak’s poster highlighted efforts to improve cost and address logistical challenges such as customs delays and refrigeration requirements in shipping reagents to partner labs overseas, demonstrating how GEARS supports biodefense surveillance labs in harsh environments.

Huie attended several sessions that resonated with her work in virology, including discussions on broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures and innovative technologies.

“The antiviral research presented at MHSRS directly relates to what we do in virology, and the sessions provided valuable insights into new approaches and products,” she said.

Rozak found the session on AI-empowered robots particularly compelling.

“It’s a fascinating intersection of technology and health care that highlights how robots can assist medics in hazardous environments, improving outcomes for wounded soldiers,” he said.

Looking Ahead

As the symposium concluded, Huie and Rozak expressed optimism about the future of military medical research and lessons learned will be used to further USAMRIID’s mission.

“The collaborations and ideas generated here will help ensure our work directly benefits the Warfighter,” said Huie.

As for Rozak, he referenced possibilities and readiness.

“The ability to interface with colleagues, funders, and industry leaders is invaluable,” he said. “It’s about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and ensuring our efforts align with the military’s health and readiness goals.”

The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe.
The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare.
The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility.
The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel.","Although the Defense Authorization Act signed by former President Biden blocks the U.S. Military’s healthcare system from providing specialized treatments to the transgender children of service members, three families are suing the Department of Defense (DOD) to reinstate the benefit, claiming they have been left with “significant” and “crushing out-of-pocket costs.” Leftist groups were outraged when the measure passed late last year and called on Biden to veto it because it bans the military’s Tricare Health Plan from covering gender-affirming care such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants to treat “gender dysphoria.” An analysis cited by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a leader in the campaign opposing the military’s transgender healthcare ban, estimates that 2,500 minor patients receive care for gender dysphoria through Tricare and 900 get puberty-suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.

In their lawsuit against the DOD military personnel with transgender children claim that Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm and that plaintiffs’ families now face significant and crushing out-of-pocket costs. “This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country,” according to the complaint filed this month by two LGBTQ+ rights groups on behalf of the families. The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe. The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare. The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility. Without Tricare coverage the testosterone prescription is “too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the complaint states, adding that the “process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

Servicemembers and their families have been able to obtain puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone therapy for their transgender children through the military insurance for nearly a decade, one of the LGBTQ+ groups that filed the lawsuit writes in a statement that blames President Trump for ordering the DOD to terminate the essential care. “As a result of the Trump administration’s directive, the families’ trusted doctors cannot provide ongoing care and families are unfairly forced to take on this financial burden,” according to the group, which accuses the Trump administration of waging a relentless assault on transgender Americans and issuing a barrage of discriminatory executive orders designed to strip away their basic legal rights and deny them recognition. The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel. Leftist groups like the ACLU mounted a campaign to pressure Biden to veto the bill, but he signed it even though it prohibits insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria,” including the hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants taken by the minors in this lawsuit.",https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JW_2025Template_CorruptionChronicles-Logo_09.12_1200x627_v1.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-09-12 13:56:12.654193

Of the different types of health insurance coverage, employment-based insurance was the most common, covering 53.8% of the population for some or all of the year, followed by Medicare (19.1%), Medicaid (17.6%), direct-purchase coverage (10.7%), TRICARE (2.8%), and VA and CHAMPVA coverage (1.2%).
Meanwhile, the 2024 public coverage rate was 0.8 percentage points lower than the rate in 2023.
CBO estimates that the law will increase the number of people without health insurance by 10.9 million in 2034.
Changes to Medicaid would be expected to increase the number of people without health insurance by 7.8 million in 2034.","About 8% of Americans were uninsured in 2024, a rate that held fairly steady over the preceding year, according to new federal data released by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Ninety-two percent were enrolled in some sort of coverage last year, representing about 310 million people. Private health insurance coverage continued to be more prevalent than public coverage, at 66.1% and 35.5%, respectively.

Of the different types of health insurance coverage, employment-based insurance was the most common, covering 53.8% of the population for some or all of the year, followed by Medicare (19.1%), Medicaid (17.6%), direct-purchase coverage (10.7%), TRICARE (2.8%), and VA and CHAMPVA coverage (1.2%).

The private coverage rate increased from 2023 to 2024 by 0.7 percentage points, driven by an increase in direct purchase coverage, the report found.

Meanwhile, the 2024 public coverage rate was 0.8 percentage points lower than the rate in 2023. This decrease, the report found, was driven by a change in Medicaid coverage, which was 1.3 percentage points lower in 2024.

Medicare coverage and VA and CHAMPVA coverage rates both increased from 2023 to 2024.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Separately, KFF released an analysis of the Census Bureau data, finding that certain provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would likely increase the uninsured rate over the next 10 years.

While robust Marketplace enrollment helped keep the uninsured rate low in 2024, the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits for Marketplace enrollees, which will happen at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts to extend them, will increase the number of people without health insurance, KFF said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act imposes new work requirements and more frequent eligibility determinations for some Medicaid enrollees, and limits how states can finance their share of Medicaid spending. It also restricts immigrant eligibility for both Medicaid and the subsidized Marketplace coverage, and according to KFF, will make it harder for people to renew Marketplace coverage and enroll in coverage following a change in circumstances.

CBO estimates that the law will increase the number of people without health insurance by 10.9 million in 2034.

""This projected increase in the number of people who are uninsured would reverse more than a decade of coverage gains under the ACA,"" KFF wrote. ""The impact on access and affordability of healthcare will be significant for those who lose coverage, leading to reduced use of health services, increased financial burden and medical debt, and worse health outcomes.""

THE LARGER TREND

On top of the 10.9 million people projected to lose coverage due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, CBO estimated in June that another 16 million people would lose health insurance by 2034 under policies affecting the Affordable Care Act. These include the elimination of the premium tax credit at the end of 2025 and the implementation of a proposed Department of Health and Human Services rule regarding coverage that is included in HR 1.

If more people are uninsured, that in turn would add to the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals, CBO said.

Changes to Medicaid would be expected to increase the number of people without health insurance by 7.8 million in 2034. The increase is due to several proposed provisions, including work requirements.

Few of those disenrolled from Medicaid would have access to employment-based coverage, and none would be eligible for the premium tax credit, the CBO said.",http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/hfn/files/2025-09/Patient_Receptionist_Luis%20Alvarez_Getty%20Images.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-12 11:56:08.293547

While it covers care abroad, it is not available to every veteran, especially those separated from service without retiree status.
Overseas coverage is via TRICARE Prime/Prime Remote Overseas (AD & command-sponsored family) and TRICARE Select Overseas (for other eligible beneficiaries).
The Foreign Medical Program (FMP) The Foreign Medical Program helps veterans who live or travel abroad receive care for service-connected conditions.","Understanding your veteran insurance options is the first step to making confident healthcare decisions. Between TRICARE, VA medical benefits, and the Foreign Medical Program (FMP), each serves a different purpose. Add in the complexity of military health benefits, and many veterans wonder which program actually works best for their situation, especially when living or traveling abroad.

Choosing the right coverage affects more than paperwork, it directly impacts your access to care, wait times, and financial peace of mind. For veterans balancing service-connected conditions, family needs, or even a move overseas, knowing how each program works is essential.

The Complexity of Military Health Benefits

For many veterans, terms like TRICARE, VA healthcare, and FMP sound similar, but they serve different groups:

TRICARE is mainly for active-duty, retirees, and their families.

VA healthcare is for eligible veterans living in the U.S. Veterans living abroad can still use VA facilities when in the U.S.

The Foreign Medical Program supports veterans living internationally (or traveling internationally) with service-connected conditions from 0% to 100% (and conditions medically associated with/aggravating those), or care while participating in VR&E. It does not cover care in the U.S. or U.S. territories. Veterans should register for FMP (you don’t have to be enrolled in VA health care to register).

Common Questions Veterans and Families Face

Am I covered if I live abroad?

Do I need more than one program?

Can I use these benefits at a veteran clinic overseas?

What happens if I need specialized care not available at home?

What TRICARE Covers

TRICARE is the healthcare program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide.

Eligibility for TRICARE

Active-duty service members

Military Retirees

Certain National Guard/Reserve members

Eligible dependents

TRICARE it is not a general veteran benefit after separation (unless retired or otherwise eligible)

Services and Limitations

TRICARE offers a broad scope of services, but costs and networks vary depending on your status. While it covers care abroad, it is not available to every veteran, especially those separated from service without retiree status.

Overseas coverage is via TRICARE Prime/Prime Remote Overseas (AD & command-sponsored family) and TRICARE Select Overseas (for other eligible beneficiaries).

The Foreign Medical Program (FMP)

The Foreign Medical Program helps veterans who live or travel abroad receive care for service-connected conditions.

Who Qualifies for FMP

Any veteran with a VA-rated service-connected condition (even with a 0% rating) getting care outside the U.S. may qualify for FMP coverage for that condition (registration required).

Care Abroad Through the FMP

The program allows veterans to access approved treatment overseas. Clinics experienced with FMP documentation (like our teams in the Dominican Republic) can help veterans with the paperwork, making care seamless. Providers can bill FMP directly; if they don’t, the veteran pays and files for reimbursement. Claims must be filed within 2 years of care.",https://veteranscareinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/veteran-insurance-options.avif,N,0.0,2025-09-12 11:56:13.996765

As far as TRICARE goes, I'd at least enroll yourself to maintain coverage and eligibility. Search the rates for single sponsorship coverage for medical retirees, should be under 100 a month (my family plan is 96 a month). I've used TRICARE many times for medicine coverage when given meds by community care, the ER, etc. and it's damn good for that.

If you don't enroll you'll only be eligible to enroll during open season enrollment periods, and if it was me I'd want as much coverage as possible even if the vast majority is redundant. Another benefit of TRICARE (I highly recommend Select, not Prime!) is that you can see a doctor very quickly usually on the doctor's availability. Prime you need to see a doctor to verify medical necessity of any specialists, Select you can cut the middle man out and go straight to the specialist.

A good example of this being useful was when I had a random throat closing episode. Had to go to the ER. Closest VA appt was 4 months out. I called up TRICARE Select, I was able to see an ENT doctor in 3 days. 50 dollar copay for the visit after x-rays and prescription.

That is the main benefit of TRICARE coverage imo, its speed.

You could enroll into the Tricare Retiree program but you’d have to pay into that. Prime is good if you want to be seen in the MTF but Select is also good because you can just get seen out in town without an authorization, as long as the facility is within the Tricare network. If you have TriWest with the VA, Tricare will be the last insurance you can use and will be the last to get billed. Usually TriWest is really good at covering the costs though. Keep in mind you can only be on one Tricare plan. So you can be under the Retiree program and pay into it, or be under your wife and not pay for it. Hope that helps",,N,0.0,2025-09-12 06:56:11.338356

Seventeen Democrats voted to advance the bill despite this.
“I want to make sure we understand some broad themes—why these amendments are problematic,” said Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington.
Reps. Fields and Figures approved the proposed trans care funding ban for Tricare, but not the other amendments—including the similar care regulation on the EFMP.
Ultimately, 37 Democratic senators voted in favor of that NDAA with that anti-trans provision intact.","Six anti-trans amendments were added to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on Wednesday, Sept. 10, during a Congressional debate over the routine greenlighting of the defense budget. Seventeen Democrats voted to advance the bill despite this.

The provisions include two all-ages health insurance restrictions for trans service members and their families, who are already being forced out of the military; a rule barring cadets assigned male at birth from any “athletic program or activity” for women, functioning as a sort of military-grade anti-trans sports ban; a “trans bathroom ban” for all single-sex military facilities, including housing and locker rooms; the exclusion of gender identity from military surveys; and a functional ban on Pride flags at all Department of War (deadname: “Defense”) workplaces.

If signed into law, most trans-affirming care will be defunded for those on Tricare and the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP).

“I want to make sure we understand some broad themes—why these amendments are problematic,” said Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington.

“The transgender community has been targeted and discriminated against aggressively,” he said in a speech on the floor. “This is exactly what these amendments are about—a right-wing culture war.”

Four of amendments—including one of the anti-gender affirming care provisions, the sex segregation of athletics, the rule against trans-inclusive surveys and the anti-trans facilities policy—were introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, who spewed anti-trans slurs onto the House floor. The Trump acolyte is also running for South Carolina Governor.

Some of the worst offenders were Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina, both of whom voted in favor of all six provisions. Rep. Adam Gray voted for all of them except the flag ban, and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted in favor of the restrictions on health care and military athletics.

Reps. Fields and Figures approved the proposed trans care funding ban for Tricare, but not the other amendments—including the similar care regulation on the EFMP.

Meanwhile, the athletics provision was also supported by Democratic Reps. Laura Gillen, John Mannion and Tom Suozzi of New York; Jared Golden of Maine; Susie Lee of Nevada; and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Kim Schrier of Washington.

""The Democrats who voted for the anti-trans NDAA amendments are out of line if they think throwing military families under the bus will win them votes,” said Tyler Hack, Executive Director of The Christopher Street Project, a group dedicated to supporting trans-friendly Democrats in elections. “Now is not a time for leaders to capitulate to this disgraceful attempt to erase trans people from existence and erode the fundamental rights for anyone who doesn't fit MAGA's ideal.”

All the amendments passed via a voice vote, but Democratic representatives insisted on a roll-call vote, where despite the anti-trans amendments, at least 17 Democrats voted to advance the full NDAA bill with the provisions included.

The December iteration of the NDAA also included language targeting what Senator Tammy Baldwin called “servicemembers’ parental rights to access medically necessary health care for their transgender children.” She and 24 other Democrats pushed for an amendment to block the anti-trans language, but a vote on that provision was sidestepped by Senate leadership—which, at the time, was controlled by Democrats. As Erin in the Morning reported, they refused to let the amendment even come to a vote. Ultimately, 37 Democratic senators voted in favor of that NDAA with that anti-trans provision intact.

“The National Defense Authorization Act has traditionally received strong bipartisan support, yet for the second Congress in a row House Republicans have tainted a bill aimed at improving the lives of servicemembers with poison-pill riders that threaten our troops’ rights, their families’ stability, and our efforts to retain top talent,” said Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat and Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, as per Bluesky.

“Republicans’ sacrifice of a strong bipartisan vote for a politicized NDAA to appease the Trump Administration and a small slice of their base cannot undo the sacrifice of the transgender servicemembers, cadets, or military dependents that will be hurt by this bill.”

The debates were marked by a sense of chaos on the House Floor, which transpired as news permeated about the assasination of the ultra-conservative and anti-trans pundit Charlie Kirk.

GOP congressmembers tried to stop Rep. Maxine Dexter of Oregon from even holding a Pride flag while speaking out in support of LGBTQ servicemembers. Rep. Sara Jacobs of California countered anti-trans rhetoric by drawing attention to the many kinds of gender-affirming care commonly provided to cisgender people, such as Botox, but Rep. Mace began yelling and posted on social media that Jacobs, who is Jewish, needs a “nose job.”",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603119761708-9252f043c139?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxjb25ncmVzc3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3NTc2MDA4ODF8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080,N,0.0,2025-09-11 22:56:08.230843

“Filler is gender-affirming care,” she continued.
“Boob jobs is gender-affirming care.
Botox is gender-affirming care.
You are an insult.” A clip of Jacobs’ remarks — and Mace’s tantrum in response — has been widely shared on social media.","U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) lashed out at Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.), an LGBTQ ally whose brother is transgender, after Jacobs criticized Republicans for introducing a series of anti-transgender amendments to the annual National Defense Authorization Act.

Several of the amendments — including some introduced by Mace herself — target gender-affirming care for transgender service members. One Mace-backed measure would bar TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, from covering gender-affirming treatments.

“I would just like to point out that it’s interesting my colleague from South Carolina is so obsessed with the issue of trans people, using horrible slurs to talk about them, when many people in this body have received gender-affirming care,” Jacobs said on the House floor.

“Filler is gender-affirming care,” she continued. “Boob jobs is gender-affirming care. Botox is gender-affirming care. Lots of my colleagues have received gender-affirming care, and let me be clear, I think everybody should have access to the gender-affirming care they need, and I think that we should respect everybody in this country.”

According to The Hill, Mace — no longer recognized for debate and standing elsewhere on the floor — allegedly yelled at Jacobs for making comments about “my body.”

“Ridiculous,” Mace shouted. “You are absolutely ridiculous. What the hell is your problem?… You are disgusting. You are an insult.”

A clip of Jacobs’ remarks — and Mace’s tantrum in response — has been widely shared on social media.

Jacobs asked that Mace’s words be stricken from the official record, but presiding officers rejected the request, arguing that Mace was not recognized when she lashed out at the California Democrat.

It remains unclear why Mace believed Jacobs was referring to her personally. Some online commenters — including Mace’s former communications director — have speculated she has had cosmetic surgery, according to The List, an entertainment and celebrity news site. Those rumors have not been verified.

Mace, who has recently made opposition to transgender rights central to her political identity, scolded Jacobs on X and invoked her status as a sexual assault survivor in response to the criticism.

“To @RepSaraJacobs, I talk about women’s safety and your response is commentary about my body on the House floor. If you knew anything about survivors you would know some women change their bodies because of the trauma of sexual violence. They live with the consequences for a lifetime,” Mace wrote.

Mace then added, “PS – I have a good surgeon if you ever want to get your nose done.” Critics noted the remark targeted Jacobs, who is Jewish, and echoed anti-Semitic tropes about Jewish women’s appearance.

A day later, the Nexus Project — an Israeli nonprofit that says it combats anti-Semitism — lightly chastised Mace on Bluesky: “We call on all members of Congress manage to refrain from antisemitic, schoolyard bullying about their Jewish colleagues’ noses generally, and especially in a post about respecting women’s bodies.”

No other major anti-Semitism watchdog groups publicly defended Jacobs or condemned Mace’s remark.

Jacobs did not respond to the anti-Semitic trope, but she did reply to a separate X post in which Mace claimed, “there is no such thing as a ‘trans child.'”

“I feel sad for you,” wrote Jacobs. “Stop lashing out against trans kids and pretending it’s to ‘protect women.’ Hope you get the help you need.”",https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nancy-Mace-Sara-Jacobs-Official-Portraits.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-11 22:56:17.578101

Program Origin

ILER was approved in January 2013 as a Joint Incentive Fund initiative to support White House Presidential directives for managing beneficiary and deployment health needs.

What ILER Is:

ILER is a secure, centralized system that gathers and integrates data from multiple sources.

Information includes unit assignments, deployment records, environmental monitoring systems, and known hazard reports.

The ILER platform provides consolidated, career-long exposure information that’s been submitted for individual service members. Exposures may have occurred in combat zones, during training, or in garrison environments.

Privacy and data security are central to ILER’s design.

Access is strictly limited to authorized DOW and VA personnel and is governed by robust federal data protection standards.

For veterans, ILER can play a vital role in the VA disability claims process.

ILER helps verify exposure history, especially when a veteran’s recollections can be confirmed with documented environmental or unit-based data.

Ultimately, ILER is a major step forward in the military’s commitment to lifelong care for service members and veterans. By improving how we track, understand and respond to environmental and occupational exposures, ILER helps us recognize and better support service member and veteran’s health concerns.

The Steube amendment was made part of the larger National Defense Authorization Act, which now goes to the Senate for consideration.","Arlington, Va. -- The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Sept. 10 to approve a plan to restore chiropractic services at more than a dozen U.S. military bases where services have been arbitrarily discontinued. The action is consistent with the Defense Health Agency’s (DHA) ongoing concern over the use of opioids by active-duty members of the military and calls to make non-addictive alternatives for pain management more readily available to military personnel.

The amendment was introduced by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.). It reflects upon the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), which in 2001 established the original chiropractic benefit in the Department of Defense's healthcare system.

The Steube amendment responds to chiropractic clinic closures over the past year caused by contracts with participating doctors of chiropractic being allowed to elapse. It calls on DHA to develop a plan to reopen closed clinics and to explore the feasibility of putting chiropractors stationed at military facilities in the federal General Schedule (GS) system. The amendment also directs DHA to report back to the House and Senate on its progress by March 31, 2026.

Surveys show chiropractic services are highly valued at U.S. military facilities. Reports show that these clinics provide proven, cost-effective care to hundreds of patients monthly, offering a range of non-drug services to address painful musculoskeletal conditions commonly experienced by members of the military and enabling them to return to service.

“We thank Rep. Steube for his foresight to tackle this issue and we also acknowledge House Armed Services Committee Chair Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) for his long-standing support of chiropractic in the military,” said John Falardeau, American Chiropractic Association (ACA) senior vice president of public policy and advocacy.

A four-year clinical trial conducted at several military sites—the largest chiropractic clinical trial on record—showed evidence that chiropractic care, when added to usual medical care, resulted in moderate short-term improvements in low back pain intensity in active-duty personnel. The results of the trial, published in 2018 by JAMA Network Open, served as additional support for the inclusion of chiropractic services as a component of multidisciplinary health care for back pain, as currently recommended by existing guidelines.

The Steube amendment was made part of the larger National Defense Authorization Act, which now goes to the Senate for consideration. ACA will be working with senators to ensure the provision remains in the final defense package.

Walter Reed Leads the Way in Integrating Pain and Substance Use Disorder Care

By Roan Smith, WRNMMC Office of Command Communications

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center recently hosted a Pain Care Skills training and Substance Use Disorder Care event in Washington, DC. For the first time they merged two traditionally separate annual events with the intent to gather international experts and military professionals with a shared goal: improving pain management for service members, veterans and war-impacted civilians.

Effective pain care is directly tied to readiness, recovery and quality of life—not only for active-duty service members preparing to return to duty, but also for veterans and civilian patients who look to Walter Reed for presidential-level care.

This year’s training brought together military and civilian providers from across the country, with both in-person and virtual sessions designed to improve how providers treat pain and prevent substance use disorder.

By integrating substance use disorder and pain treatment, Walter Reed is modeling a new standard of care that not only serves military beneficiaries but also influences best practices across health systems.

“We’re really leading the Military Health System—and even the civilian communities—in integrating care for both substance use disorder and pain,” said Dr. Christopher Spevak, director of the National Capital Region’s (NCR) Opioid Safey Program and the deputy director of the NCR’s Pain Initiative and Wounded Warrior Pain Care Initiative. “By bringing these groups together, it becomes a force multiplier in terms of taking care of patients.”

The symposium combined nine virtual meetings and 24 in-person workshops, creating a blended model of education that brought together internationally recognized experts and hands-on training. Online sessions included topics such as Dopamine Nation and the Pleasure-Pain Balance by Dr. Anna Lembke of Stanford, An Overview of the Management of Benzodiazepine Use Disorder by Dr. Logan Adam, and Artificial Technology in Pain Medicine: Transforming Assessment and Treatment Through Technology. In-Person workshops provided practical skills in therapists ranging from battlefield acupuncture and medical hypnosis to musculoskeletal ultrasound, art therapy, dry needling and cupping.

“This blended format allows us to reach a wide audience while ensuring providers gain practical, skills-based training,” said Spevak. “It’s something that isn’t being modeled anywhere else.”

This year also featured the International Pain Working Group, which brought together military physicians from partner nations including Germany, France, Georgia, and Australia. The group aims to share best practices, collaborate on research and improve pain care for service members worldwide.

Lt. Col Alex Kumar, the U.K.’s defense medical services lead for pain managements, stressed the importance of empathy in caring for services members.

“It’s about empathy, it’s about communication,” said Kumar. “Especially for the military population — these people have put their lives at risk. So, it is our duty to give them the best possible care we can.”

The training also showcased lessons from the battlefield. Dr. Marshall Bedder, a former Navy commander described his deployment experience. “In Kandahar in 2014, all battlefield injuries were treated by medics with nasal ketamine, and we had amazing success with that,” said Bedder. “This ability to use a nasal mister is so simple.”

By blending clinical research, real-world lessons, and hands-on skills, this year’s Pain Care Skills Training reinforced Walter Reed’s Leadership in advancing pain care across military health system and beyond.

Walter Reed’s Pain Management team continues to deliver world-class care that supports the readiness of our force and he health of our community. For more information about Walter Reed’s Pain Management Clinic talk to your primary care provider.

If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.
So, Americans with “creditable” coverage can apply for a Medicare Part D plan at a later date without paying a penalty.
(Chapter 5 of the Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).
Medicare calculates the Part D penalty by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium” ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months you didn’t have either Part D or creditable coverage and rounding to the nearest 10 cents.","UNITED STATES—Hello Toni: When I turned 65 in May 2024, I continued to work full-time with a health savings account HSA as my employer benefits and use GoodRX to cover prescriptions. My employer’s human resources manager advised me to enroll in Medicare Part A when I turned 65, which was not correct information because I could not fund my HSA from the time I enrolled in Medicare Part A. When I retire at 70 is when I will enroll in Medicare Part B.

Now I am experiencing a Medicare issue and need guidance, Toni. In July, I applied on medicare.gov for a Medicare Part D plan to begin Aug. 1 because I am now taking an expensive blood pressure prescription that GoodRX does not cover which costs over $650 a month.

I just received a notice from Medicare saying they do not have a record of me having prescription drug coverage that “met Medicare’s minimum standards” from 5/1/2024 to 7/31/2025, and I will receive a Part D late enrollment penalty. What does this mean?

Toni…Thank you in advance,

Don from Charlotte, NC

Don: I do not have good news for you. You have a Medicare Part D prescription drug penalty problem because you did not enroll in a Medicare Part D plan at the right time when your Part A began 5/1/2024. Unfortunately, prescription discount programs — such as GoodRx, Single Care, AmazonRX or store prescription memberships such as Walmart, Kroger, etc., are not considered “creditable” coverage which is why you will be receiving Medicare’s late enrollment penalty (LEP).

The Medicare & You handbook states: Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.

So, Americans with “creditable” coverage can apply for a Medicare Part D plan at a later date without paying a penalty. (Chapter 5 of the Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).

The Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) when applying for Medicare Part D can be applied if:

— You are older than 65, retiring and leaving employer benefits and waited more than 63 days without creditable prescription drug coverage to enroll in Part D. (Filing Medicare forms with Social Security does not inform Medicare that you had creditable prescription drug coverage. Do not wait to enroll in a Part D plan.)

–Your prescription drug benefit (not health benefits) is not creditable as Medicare defines it.

–You never enrolled in Medicare Part D when first eligible for Medicare.

Medicare calculates the Part D penalty by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium” ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months you didn’t have either Part D or creditable coverage and rounding to the nearest 10 cents. That amount is added to your monthly Part D premium.

Your late enrollment period (LEP) does not begin from the day you lose or leave your company health plan, but from the month your Medicare Part A started. So, Don, your 14 months without creditable coverage will cost you an extra $5.15 per month plus the Part D premium for 2025. The national base amount can change each year, so your penalty will change and NEVER go away.

Remember with Medicare what you don’t know that WILL hurt you! Please enroll in Medicare Part D whether you are taking prescriptions or not.

Army Heat Center S. Army Heat Center HPRC (WHEC resource hub): https://www.hprc-online.org/resources-partners/whec ***","Newswise — Bethesda, Md. — The Uniformed Services University (USU), in partnership with the U.S. Army Heat Center and other Department of Defense collaborators, has released the a recently updated standardized Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the Management of Exertional Rhabdomyolysis (ER) in Warfighters. Developed through USU’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP) and the Warfighter Heat- and Exertion-Related Events Collaborative (WHEC), this guideline provides military clinicians with a critical, evidence-based framework to identify, manage, and return Service Members to duty following this potentially dangerous condition.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis—muscle breakdown caused by strenuous activity—can escalate quickly to serious complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI). The updated guideline standardizes recognition, risk stratification, treatment, and return-to-duty (RTD) decisions across the Military Health System, ensuring timely and consistent care while protecting Service Members and strengthening operational readiness. Importantly, while designed with Warfighters in mind, the principles outlined in the guideline also have broad application for civilian populations—including athletes, first responders, and others who engage in intense physical activity.

“We are very pleased to release this 2025 Rhabdomyolysis CPG update, which presents multiple significant changes and additions from our 2020 product,” said Dr. Francis O’Connor, professor of Military and Emergency Medicine and medical director of CHAMP. “Our joint service team of DoD providers, representing hundreds of years of military relevant experience, has worked very hard to share the most current evidence-based information to our military colleagues to optimize the diagnosis and initial management of warfighters impacted by exertional rhabdomyolysis, and importantly, facilitate return to duty decisions.”

The extensively updated guideline sets a clear standard for diagnosing exertional rhabdomyolysis, helping doctors recognize the condition earlier and with greater accuracy. It also gives medical teams a way to quickly sort patients into low-, or high-risk categories to assist in both initial management and return to duty decisions. High-risk warning signs include significantly elevated muscle enzyme levels, signs of dangerous muscle pressure inside the muscles (compartment syndrome), lab results that show kidney damage, very dark urine, serious chemical imbalances in the blood, or having the sickle cell trait. Another important tool introduced in this update is the McMahon Score, which combines lab results and patient information to help predict the chance of severe kidney injury or the need for dialysis. Patients are also considered higher risk if their situation makes it hard to ensure close medical follow-up.

For patients who need to be admitted to the hospital, the guideline recommends treatments that protect the kidneys and close monitoring for those at moderate to high risk of complications. For patients who can be managed outside the hospital, it provides a clear step-by-step approach focused on staying well-hydrated, limiting activity, and coming back for a check-up within 24–72 hours. This outpatient pathway is especially important for lower-risk cases or when exertional rhabdomyolysis is suspected but not yet confirmed.

Decisions about returning to duty are guided by a gradual, staged process. Low-risk patients start with rest, fluids, and careful monitoring, then slowly move through reconditioning phases until they can safely return to full activity if symptoms don’t return. Patients at higher risk, or those who experience the condition more than once, require a tailored plan that involves input from medical specialists. To support clinicians in these decisions, the guideline includes practical tools such as step-by-step flow charts, a glossary of terms, and appendices that address duty profiles, return-to-duty guidance, and medical coding.

”At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own. Unlike exertional heat stroke, prior to the development of this CPG, return-to-duty guidance was lacking,” said Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) David DeGroot, director of the Army Heat Center. “Now, providers have a resource to help as they work to return the injured warfighter to duty as quickly as possible but without jeopardizing their health or increasing risk of reoccurrence.”

The CPG is designed for use by military primary care, emergency medicine, sports medicine, and operational clinicians, as well as command medical leaders overseeing training, selection, and deployment cycles. Civilian clinicians may also find it a valuable reference when treating exertional rhabdomyolysis in athletic or occupational settings.

The Clinical Practice Guideline: Management of Exertional Rhabdomyolysis in Warfighters (September 2025) is now available online in 508-compliant PDF format at: https://www.hprc-online.org/resources-partners/whec/clinical-care/clinical-practice.
