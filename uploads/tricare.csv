""Brett Favre ultimately ruined my life.""
When does the Netflix documentary on Brett Favre air?","A new Netflix documentary, ""UNTOLD: The Fall of Favre,"" explores the multifaceted life and career of Brett Favre.

The film examines both Favre's football accomplishments and controversies, including allegations of inappropriate messages sent to Jenn Sterger.

While Favre did not participate in the documentary, Sterger alleges Favre's actions negatively impacted her life.

If you ask someone what they think of NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre, you most likely will get a strong opinion. What that opinion might be depends on who you ask.

Whether it's the family man who married his high school sweetheart, father of two daughters or the talented athlete who broke tons of records and led the Green Bay Packers to a Super Bowl win, Favre is a no doubt a sports hero.

You might have spotted him in movies such as ""There's Something About Mary"" alongside Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz or in ""Reggie's Prayer"" or any number of commercials, including for Wrangler jeans, Right Guard deodorant or Prilosec.

But then there's the other side. Jenn Sterger, who worked for the New York Jets at the same time Favre was on the team, alleges Favre sent her text messages, some of which included explicit photos.

The many sides of Favre are explored in a new Netflix documentary about the star athlete, taking him from his early days of football with father, Irvin, and at the University of Southern Mississippi to today and the shadows that cloud his shining star.

Netflix's ""UNTOLD: The Fall of Favre,"" directed by Rebecca Gitlitz, gives an in-depth look at the public figure, exploring his football career as well as some of the controversies that surround him, the most recent of which is the Mississippi welfare fraud scandal.

While he has never been accused of a crime, he received more than $1 million for speaking engagements that never materialized. Favre returned the money, but he is a party in a civil lawsuit connected with the case. Favre denies any wrongdoing.

Add to that the investments in and campaigns for Prevacus, which was supposed to produce a miracle concussion drug, and World Health Industries, producer of RxPro, another miracle drug, this for pain relief. It turns out, the pain cream scheme was a fraud that resulted in more than $1.5 billion in losses to TRICARE and other health care benefit providers.

The fraud eventually sent dozens to prison. As an investor, however, Favre was not a party to the fraud itself, and was never charged with any crimes connected to it.

You get the drift. While Favre may be a superhero on the field, he is also a man, like any other.

The tone for the documentary is set right away with an appearance by Michael Vick, another star quarterback whose star was tarnished by choices he made off-field. While Vick was able to overcome his past and return to coach college football, the shadow remains.

Gitlitz said in an interview with the Hattiesburg American and Clarion Ledger that she wanted to show people that there is more than one side to a person, and some of those sides can be complex.

What are the highlights of the Favre documentary?

The documentary focuses heavily on Sterger and the controversy surrounding her connection with Favre. It shows Sterger's rise to fame up to the point when the infamous text messages began rolling in.

Sterger said when the news broke about the texts, her life was ruined. She says she's not the only one who was affected by the radiation surrounding Favre's star.

""We get left in the wake because we were never the story,"" Sterger said in the documentary. ""Brett Favre ultimately ruined my life.""

There are other familiar faces in the documentary, including U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson and longtime sports columnist Rick Cleveland.

Favre himself, although the center of the documentary, did not give an interview, nor did any of the people closest to him, despite attempts made by Gitlitz and her team.

The director said the documentary isn't just about Favre and Sterger or Favre and football.

There are many aspects Gitlitz explored, including how other people are impacted by Favre, whether it is to be in awe of his football skills, adore him as a family man or question his character because of his connections and the allegations made against him.

""There are numerous narratives that needed to be unpacked here, so I really meant for all sides of the story (to be told),"" Gitlitz said. ""You cannot take away from what Brett Favre did on the field. I wouldn't want to take away that he was a charismatic guy. I think that it's OK for two things to exist at the same time.""

When does the Netflix documentary on Brett Favre air?

""Untold, the Fall of Favre"" is according to Netflix an ""eye-opening documentary"" that ""delves into Brett Favre's controversial career, the dark side of sports stardom and the scandals that marred his legacy.""

It airs on the streaming service starting Tuesday, May 20 at 2 a.m. Central time.","https://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/17/PHAT/83693281007-untold-the-fall-of-favre-ss-12287177-b.jpg?crop=2011,1131,x0,y300&width=2011&height=1131&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,0.0,2025-05-20 03:56:18.272672

And I think President Trump has a great place to start by supporting our bill to expand IVF coverage for military families.","NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Today, May 19, 2025, is the deadline for policy recommendations on ways to implement President Donald Trump’s executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and lower its costs. And while his administration is currently contemplating some bizarre and patronizing ways to raise birth rates, like baby bonuses and motherhood awards, my suggestion is to support military families who desperately want to grow their families.

I’m incredibly proud to represent San Diego, the biggest military community in the country, which is home to 110,000 active-duty service members and more than 118,000 of their family members. So, I hear all the time about their lives and their struggles to pay rent and put food on the table, their inability to find reliable childcare, their concerns about their safety, and their journeys with infertility.

For example, a senior-enlisted sailor, Matt, shared with me that he and his wife Jenny had two daughters via IVF – after five miscarriages, seven frozen embryo transfers, 600 shots and spending $80,000.

PRO-LIFE LEADERS URGE TRUMP TO REVERSE HIS IVF STAND, SAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS 'NOT PRO-LIFE'

About a quarter of active-duty service members and military spouses report infertility, which is double the national average of the general population. When we think about the level of sacrifices we’re asking from our military families, their struggles with infertility make sense.

Our service members endure physically intensive training, demanding schedules, and frequent relocations during their prime reproductive years. Deployments are often long and stressful, where they’re physically separated from their partner, which also takes an emotional toll. On top of that, military service also means living and working in hazardous environments that can negatively impact fertility.

Despite all of these well-documented stressors, TRICARE, the country’s military health insurance plan, only covers fertility services for those who can prove a service connection to injury or illness, which is often impossible to do. This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether.

The cost-of-living crisis is affecting everyone in our country, but especially military families, many of whom live on fixed incomes and struggle to afford childcare, housing and food on the table. This isn’t a demographic that can easily afford tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket on anything, so folks are leaving the military for this coverage, worsening our recruitment and retention challenges and impacting our military readiness.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP SEEKS TO EXPAND FERTILITY COVERAGE, AFTER TIM WALZ ONCE ACCUSED HIM OF BEING ‘ANTI-IVF’

Military families need IVF access. They deserve it. And they’ve earned it. That’s why I introduced the ""IVF for Military Families Act"" alongside Illinois Democrat Senator Tammy Duckworth to require TRICARE to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, including IVF. Our legislation would cover up to three complete egg retrievals, unlimited embryo transfers, and the necessary medications for IVF and intrauterine insemination (IUI).

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Starting this year, members of Congress and our staff have access to comprehensive infertility treatment, including IVF coverage, just like many other civilian employees in the federal and private sectors. We shouldn’t have access to benefits that our military families don’t have. But despite this hypocrisy, our bill still lacks support from my Republican colleagues in both the House and Senate.

I’m (obviously) skeptical of Trump’s commitment to expanding IVF access, but he has called himself the ""Fertilization President"" and the ""father of IVF."" If he wants that to be true, he should throw his support behind a demographic that has already sacrificed so much for the safety and security of our country: our military families.

NASCAR STAR'S WIFE THANKS TRUMP FOR IVF EXECUTIVE ORDER: 'STEP FORWARD'

Expanding TRICARE coverage of IVF could be the watershed moment needed to change the entire market and ensure that everyone in our country has access to IVF. It could put market pressure on private insurers to include IVF and other fertility treatments in their healthcare coverage plans so they remain competitive.

This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether.

While the IVF for Military Families Act would be a monumental step forward, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have access to the full range of reproductive care, so they have the power and the ability to decide when and if to have children.

We ask so much from our service members – to risk their safety, to be apart from their families, and to give up certain freedoms – but we shouldn’t ask them to give up their opportunity to build a family. As a country, we need to do more than say we value our military community, we need to actually show it.

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members who live in Atlanta or Tampa, Florida, will have a new option for health care next year: Tricare Prime managed by CareSource Military and Veterans.

The nonprofit organization was awarded a contract in 2024 to run a three-year demonstration project to provide Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed care-style health program, to more than 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in the two cities, beginning in 2026.

The new agreement, which will run through 2029, gives another health care option for military beneficiaries and allows the Defense Health Agency to evaluate having other health care entities manage portions of the Tricare patient load alongside Humana Government Business, which holds the Tricare East Region contract.

[RELATED: Urge Your Lawmakers to Strengthen TRICARE Fertility Coverage]

""Tricare Prime Atlanta and Tricare Prime Tampa represent an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,"" Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the DHA, said in a statement May 7. ""The data we get from this demonstration will inform future Tricare innovations nationwide.""

Atlanta previously served as a test bed for a three-year Tricare Prime pilot run by Humana and Kaiser Permanente, the nonprofit considered to be a pioneer in health maintenance organization programs.

That program, which ended in 2022, sought to determine whether the DHA could provide ""value-based care"" -- a health system that pays providers based on performance, quality and value as opposed to volume.

Atlanta was home to the Army's Fort McPherson until 2011 when it was closed as part of the Pentagon's 2005 Base Realignment and Closure effort. When it closed, nearly 30,000 military retirees and their families lived in the area, and Georgia has become an increasingly popular retirement state for military personnel.

Tampa is the home of U.S. Central Command and MacDill Air Force Base, with roughly 34,000 military dependents and 133,000 retirees, according to Defense Department data.

Interested patients will be able to enroll in the new Tricare Prime option during open season, which runs from early November through early December. During open season, beneficiaries can switch between Tricare programs such as Prime or Select or unique plans offered in various locations.

CareSource is a managed-care and health insurance organization that provides programs and services to 2 million people. After receiving the Tricare Prime program contract last November, the company's chief executive officer said the new programs are intended to increase access to care for Tricare Prime beneficiaries and provide personalized support.

""We are honored to be entrusted with this vital responsibility,"" CareSource CEO Erhardt Preitauer said in a statement. ""Our team is dedicated to delivering a health plan that will provide military families with access to high-quality care that is uniquely tailored to their needs.""

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Families of active-duty personnel who use Tricare Prime pay no annual enrollment fees, cost-shares or copayments. Retirees and their family members on Tricare Prime pay an annual enrollment fee, which, for most retirees, was $372 for an individual and $744 for a family in 2025.

Those beneficiaries also pay a $25 copay for a primary care visit, $38 per specialty care or urgent care visit, and $77 for an emergency room visit.

“Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do -- from the smallest interaction to the most critical decisions.
Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and healthcare systems, leading to continual process improvement.
“Patient safety is more than a measure -- it’s a mindset,” Harrell said.","The Defense Health Agency announced May 5 that three military hospitals from Defense Health Network Central earned an “A” Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade for spring 2025.

The 81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.; the 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska; and Brooke Army Medical Center, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, are among the 16 military hospitals that received top honors for their excellence in patient safety, quality and transparency.

“This recognition underscores the exceptional quality of care delivered every day across the Military Health System,” said Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central. “From routine visits to complex medical interventions, our teams are deeply committed to providing the highest standard of safe, quality care to every patient, every time.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on healthcare quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade, according to a DHA release.

NORTHERN STARS

This year marks JBER’s third consecutive time scoring an “A” grade.

JBER hospital, fondly known as “J-Bear,” is a joint venture between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs that offers primary, specialty, outpatient, and inpatient care to 25,000 enrolled beneficiaries in the Anchorage area.

“Our third consecutive ‘A’ grade from Leapfrog is a direct reflection of the relentless commitment our Airmen and staff demonstrate every day to patient safety, high-reliability practices, and mission-ready care,” said Air Force Col. Laura Baugh, 673rd Medical Group commander. “This recognition belongs to the 673rd Medical Group team, whose discipline and dedication continue to set the standard for military medicine.”

KEESLER KUDOS

This year marks Keesler Medical Center’s second consecutive year on Leapfrog’s “honor roll.”

The 81st Medical Group maintains medical readiness for worldwide contingencies by delivering safe, high-quality health care to more than 27,000 beneficiaries. The group also oversees five military medical treatment facilities spanning from Mobile, Ala., to New Orleans, La., coordinating care for over 80,000 beneficiaries along the Gulf Coast.

“This accomplishment marks a significant milestone for our hospital,” said Air Force Col. Peter Kulis, commander of the 81st Medical Group and director of Keesler Medical Center. “Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do -- from the smallest interaction to the most critical decisions. I’m deeply proud of our team, whose commitment and excellence ensure our patients receive the safest, highest-quality care possible.”

BAMC BRILLIANCE

Brooke Army Medical Center also made the spring “honor roll.”

BAMC is the largest and most robust military hospital and the only Level I Trauma Center within the Department of Defense, providing safe, high-quality care to service members, their families, veterans, and civilian emergency patients.

BAMC serves more than 250,000 military beneficiaries within San Antonio and the surrounding communities. As one of two Level I Trauma Centers in San Antonio, BAMC administers lifesaving care to civilian emergency patients from across 22 counties in Southwest Texas.

“BAMC is committed to providing our patients the best quality and safest care possible, and these results exemplify that commitment,” said Army Col. Kevin Kelly, BAMC commander. “We are very proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.”

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation is also intended to foster transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and healthcare systems, leading to continual process improvement.

“Patient safety is more than a measure -- it’s a mindset,” Harrell said. “I’m proud of our hospitals for leading the way in delivering trusted, high-reliability care and for continuously striving to raise the bar across the Military Health System.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2203/7093678/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-19 14:56:22.949007

The work of the MHS Digital Transformation Executive Committee culminated in March 2025 with the publication of the premier MHS Digital Transformation Strategy.
The council is an integrator comprised of representatives from Health Affairs, USU, Defense Health Agency, and the military departments.
Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.","Digital transformation continues to have a significant impact on the way people live and work at a rapid pace, and its influence on health care is no exception. As artificial intelligence capabilities become more widespread and sophisticated, the Department of Defense will respond with agility and flexibility to advance its responsible adoption of AI. Over the past six years, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs has worked to identify the necessary actions to enable advances and adoption of AI and machine learning across military medicine, while ensuring robust strategy, policies, governance, and safeguards are in place.

The Military Health System fosters, protects, sustains, and restores the health of active duty and reserve component forces to support the mission. The MHS has a unique mission supporting 9.5 million beneficiaries composed of uniformed service members, military retirees, and family members. The MHS started an initial artificial intelligence and machine learning inventory in 2018.

In 2019, the MHS started hosting annual workshops specifically geared towards AI and machine learning. An updated inventory was performed in 2023. Since 2024, the MHS’ goal is to focus on strategy, collaboration, and establishing guidelines aligned with the policies of the DOD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. Leveraging the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences was a natural fit to develop a strategic digital health framework for the MHS.

Digital health experts at USU were charged to lead development of this digital strategy beginning in December 2023. USU is the nation’s federal health professions academy with an emphasis on military health care, leadership, readiness, and public health. The work of the MHS Digital Transformation Executive Committee culminated in March 2025 with the publication of the premier MHS Digital Transformation Strategy. The strategy identifies four distinct lines of effort: invest in the existing digital health infrastructure; develop digital care models and empower digital self-care; develop a digitally competent medical workforce; and integrate AI and data management.

According to Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for Health Affairs, the MHS Digital Transformation Strategy represents a commitment and “is a testament to our unwavering dedication to providing the full spectrum of advanced digital health technologies to improve health outcomes for our warfighters on the battlefield or in garrison and for their families to access person-centric, healthcare tools. It harnesses America’s innate and nearly infinite capacity to innovate, enabling us to drive and master the future.”

Digital transformation refers to the process of integrating digital technologies, data analytics, and innovative processes into healthcare delivery, aiming to significantly improve the quality, efficiency, and accessibility of medical services, often including elements like telehealth, electronic health records, and patient portals, allowing for more personalized and data-driven patient care.

Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, said “digital transformation in health care has created a culture of innovation and change across the medical community, and the MHS is no different.”

“Our medical teams are working to understand how digital tools can positively impact our beneficiaries’ health and military mission success,” she said. “As we continue to traverse the future of military medicine, we know digital tools can have a great influence on access to care, better patient outcomes, disease diagnosis, and prevention at home and abroad.”

To bring the strategy to life and support implementation, Ferrara chartered the MHS Digital Policy Council in March 2025. Led by Orsega, the council provides strategic implementation, guidance, and oversight of data governance and AI policy and ensures all MHS health data integration and digital adoption activities are transparent, mutually supporting, and shared across the components of the MHS.

The scope of their oversight includes the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI within health care, the enhancement and acceleration of enterprise data management, and the review and monitoring of developing data analytic platforms. The council is an integrator comprised of representatives from Health Affairs, USU, Defense Health Agency, and the military departments.

Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.

“The integration of digital health offers opportunities to increase operational readiness, improve clinical outcomes, enhance quality and safety, reduce risks, and fortify the resilience of the total force and all DOD beneficiaries,” said Bader, who currently serves as deputy director of the General Ronald H. Griffith Institute for Military Medical Professionalism and special assistant to the dean of the Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing at USU.

According to Allen W. Middleton, a senior advisor to the president of USU, transforming the MHS into a digital health force multiplier is not an option, but necessary to ensure mission success across the DOD.

“Failing to embrace digital transformation will hinder the MHS’s ability to effectively support the National Defense Strategy, deliver the joint capabilities needed by the armed services and combatant commands, and provide quality care to the total force and DOD beneficiaries,” said Middleton. “A tightly integrated system, critical to which is digital transformation, is essential for the MHS to remain effective. If the MHS does not evolve into a digital health system, it risks falling behind in providing optimal health care, potentially jeopardizing the health and readiness of military personnel and their families.”

USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson understands the value of digital health and its benefit to patients—saving the lives of service members and getting them back to the fight as quickly as possible. But equally as important is transforming how future military doctors and nurses are learning and shortening training times through adaptive learning and digital tools.

“USU is harnessing cutting edge AI technologies to revolutionize medical education, optimizing learning efficiency, engagement, and exam performance,” said Woodson. “These AI-driven innovations enhance curriculum, personalize interactive tutoring, provide high-fidelity exam preparation and medical-interviewing simulations. I think we will be able to accomplish moving students through the curriculum in three years.”

The transformation of digital health will continue to drive success on the battlefield, in military hospitals and clinics, and in MHS training and education venues for the next decade and beyond. With the support of innovative leaders and forward-thinkers throughout the organization in healthcare delivery, operational medicine informatics and teaching those skills at USU and at military hospitals and clinics will ensure they have the tools necessary to support the health and operational medicine needs of tomorrow.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2203/7083262/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-19 14:56:25.961380

County Clerk Beth Fiegenschuh said employees who choose not to sign up for health insurance, can sign up for the cash-in-lieu option. She said the amount of the cash-in-lieu has to be set each year.

To be eligible for the cash-in-lieu option, an employee must be to be able to be added to their spouse’s group health insurance program, be on Tricare (military insurance) or both the employee and the spouse must be eligible for Medicare, according to Fiegenschuh.

Commissioner Randy Miller said the program benefits the employee and the county.

With the current number of employees opting for the cash-in-lieu instead of health insurance, the county is saving about $255,000 annually, according to Miller.

Did Zynex Deceive Investors with Inflated Revenue Figures? Lawsuit Alleges Misleading Practices

The lawsuit contends that Zynex engaged in a scheme to inflate its reported revenue by routinely sending patients more products, including electrodes, than were medically necessary. This practice, the suit alleges, drew scrutiny from insurers, most notably Tricare, the health care program for active-duty and retired U.S. military personnel, potentially leading to adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

Concerns surrounding Zynex’s business practices were amplified on June 4, 2024, with the publication of a report in the medical journal STAT. The report, titled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,” detailed what it described as an “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex allegedly sent excessive monthly supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to generate higher billings to insurers. Following the publication of the STAT report, Zynex’s stock price reportedly fell by more than 5 percent.

The lawsuit further highlights Zynex’s disclosure on March 11, 2025, when the company announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. In its report, Zynex revealed a significant revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter, attributed to slower payments from certain payers. The company also disclosed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments while it reviewed prior claims. This announcement triggered a sharp decline in Zynex’s share price, plummeting by more than 51 percent, according to the legal filing.

Tricare Suspension Exacerbates Financial Woes: Post-Lawsuit Report Reveals Deepening Revenue and Profit Decline.

The financial repercussions of the Tricare payment suspension and the alleged prior practices became more evident after the lawsuit was filed. On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported a substantial decline in its first-quarter 2025 financial performance. Net revenue for the quarter plummeted to $26.6 million, a sharp decrease from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also saw its gross profit margin contract significantly, falling to 69 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 80 percent in the prior year. This downturn resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million for the quarter, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

During the subsequent earnings call, Zynex Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sandgaard directly addressed the TriCare payment suspension as a primary factor contributing to the disappointing first-quarter results. Mr. Sandgaard stated that the disruption had a significant impact on revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring effort to prepare for a potential prolonged halt in TriCare payments.

Looking ahead, Zynex has issued a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025 and anticipates an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.20. Reflecting the considerable uncertainty surrounding its relationship with TriCare, a key payer, the company has withheld its full-year financial guidance.

Hagens Berman’s Launches Inquiry into Zynex's Disclosures Amidst Financial Turmoil

Shareholder rights law firm Hagens Berman has announced an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Zynex's recent financial disclosures and the allegations leveled in the class-action suit.

“Our investigation seeks to determine whether the company sufficiently revealed the potential pitfalls inherent in its billing methodologies and its dependence on TriCare’s financial contributions,” said Reed Kathrein, the partner spearheading the firm's probe.

Richard Barton, who retired from the Army in 2012, holds a doctorate in Clinical Social Work and has served as an Army brigade behavioral officer and served as chief of services for the Army’s Social Work Services. His primary focus at Defense Health Agency-Public Health is on behavioral health and suicide prevention.

As a leader, you play a critical role in maintaining the well-being and readiness of your service members. An often-overlooked aspect of a service member's mental and emotional health is their relationship with gambling. While many gamble casually, excessive gambling can have consequences, including financial difficulties, relationship problems and decreased job performance.

The changing face of gambling

Access to gambling has evolved; no longer confined to gaming halls of the past, it’s now available 24/7 via personal computers and smartphones. A recent review of gambling and problematic gambling published in the August 2024 journal of public health, The Lancet, estimated the amount of money lost to gambling worldwide in 2025 will be nearly $531 billion .

Moreover, The Lancet study also found that 46 percent of adults and 18 percent of adolescents have gambled within 12 months. A January 2024 study conducted by the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services found that nearly 70 percent of its residents acknowledged gambling in the past year, with 10.7 percent gambling online and 10.2 percent betting on sports. In Department of Defense studies conducted over the past 30 years, 6.3–7.1 percent of service members reported having at least one gambling issue.

The impact of excessive gambling on military service members

Excessive gambling, also known as problem gambling, is a pattern of behavior that can lead to significant distress and impairment in daily life.

The military lifestyle can lead some service members to be susceptible to excessive gambling. Some of those factors include:

Using gambling to relieve periods of stress and anxiousness.

Turning to gambling to combat boredom, such as during extended periods of “hurry-up and wait.”

Easy access to online betting platforms and, in some duty locations, gaming facilities.

Social pressures from peers, especially while viewing sporting events.

Limited financial literacy and budgeting skills.

Excessive gambling can have serious consequences for service members, including:

Financial difficulties, such as debt and bankruptcy.

Relationship problems, including marital issues and estrangement from family and friends.

Decreased job performance and reduced readiness.

Increased risk of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

Risk for increased alcohol, tobacco and substance abuse.

Disruptions to unit cohesion and morale.

Warning signs of excessive gambling

Early identification is critical in addressing excessive gambling. Leaders play a key role in identifying those struggling with this issue. Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:

Changes in behavior, such as increased irritability or mood swings.

Concerns or difficulties with paying bills or debts on time.

Frequent borrowing or requests for financial assistance.

Unexplained absences or tardiness.

Decreased participation in unit activities or social events.

Social media posts or conversations suggesting excessive gaming or betting.

Strategies for leader support for service members who may be having gambling issues

Leaders need to take steps to identify and support service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

Maintain an open-door policy: Encourage service members to come forward and discuss their concerns or struggles with excessive gambling.

Foster a supportive unit culture: Promote open communication to help reduce stigma around mental health concerns, including excessive gambling.

Promote peer support: Enable mentorship programs to help foster a culture of trust and provide a responsive support network.

Conduct regular unit assessments: Consistently assess unit cohesion and morale to identify potential issues, including those related to excessive gambling.

Identify and support the use of financial education and resources: Ensure service members know the base or installation services that offer budgeting and money management training.

Ensure access to counseling and support services: Make service members aware of, and facilitate access to, available services, including substance abuse treatment programs and financial counseling.

Develop a policy on excessive gambling: Mirror existing unit policies or develop a policy on excessive gambling and betting, including consequences for excessive behavior.

Maintain regular performance evaluations: Discuss any potential personal issues, such as excessive gaming or betting, as part of regular performance evaluations.

Stay informed: Keep up-to-date on the latest research and trends related to excessive gambling by military service members.

Conclusion

Excessive gambling is a serious issue that can lead to significant consequences for service members. Leaders are critical in identifying and supporting service members struggling with this issue. By maintaining an open-door policy, conducting regular unit assessments, and providing financial education and resources, military leaders can help service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

Remember, early identification and support are key in addressing excessive gambling. Working together can help service members overcome this issue and maintain their overall well-being and readiness.

The dish is garnished with various seasonal vegetables and, if available, island octopus. It’s all served atop vinegar-seasoned rice.

The umibudo-don (sea grape bowl), for 1,200 yen, is another option.

Both of these bowls are seasoned with Shirasa Shokudo’s original sauce made from sesame oil and salt.

“Although soy sauce is usually used for rice-bowl dishes, we don’t use it because its dark-brown color spoils the colors of other ingredients,” Kukuchi explains. “Our house-made transparent sauce can keep or even brighten the colors of the other ingredients while highlighting the flavor of each fresh local food.”

According to Kikuchi, all the dishes in her restaurant are cooked completely from scratch.

“We don’t use any precooked stuff in our dishes,” she says. “In order to serve dishes made 100-percent from scratch, we always start preparing our ingredients at 3 a.m.”

In addition to these rice-bowls, the restaurant offers taco rice, fried rice, and “goya champuru” (bitter melon stir fry). It used to offer its extremely popular “uni-don” (sea urchin bowl) but has since removed it from the menu temporarily due to a decrease in the local sea urchin population, according to Kikuchi.

“Sea urchin cannot be cultured,” she says. “So instead of using imported sea urchin as a substitute, we decided to stop serving it until the local population increases.”

The restaurant’s seating options include tables as well as traditional tatami floor seating, accommodating about 80 people in all.

Be sure to try Shirasa Shokudo during your next drive to Kouri Island. Better yet – now you have one more reason drop in on this mysterious island.

In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.
The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them.
After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted.
Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS.","On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions. A unanimous jury concluded that Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy in the United States, fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, a government military healthcare program, for more than three million false claims totaling more than $135 million in damages — one of the largest jury verdicts ever in an FCA case. If trebled, damages could reach more than $400 million, plus penalties. In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.

The relator, an Omnicare pharmacist, filed suit in 2015, and in 2019 the federal government, 29 states, and the District of Columbia intervened. The four-week jury trial began on April 1, 2025. The government alleged that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in assisted living and other long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and then submitted claims for reimbursement for those prescriptions to the federal healthcare programs. The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them. CVS focused its defense heavily on a materiality argument, arguing that the practice at issue was allowed by law in many states and accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted. Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS. Specifically, she found the evidence showed that CVS ""had ultimate oversight over Omnicare's compliance with Government program regulations — indeed, was required to do so by virtue of the [Corporate Integrity Agreement]"" that CVS had entered into in 2016 related to different conduct by Omnicare; and ""that [CVS] was aware of the compliance issues that underlie this case, and the fact that certain fixes had been proposed to remedy them"" but ""opted not to force [Omnicare] to adopt those fixes.""

The parties will submit briefing over the next month addressing the penalties to be assessed under the FCA, and CVS has said that it plans to appeal the decision. We at Qui Notes will continue to keep you updated on developments in the case.

I think the entire Reserve Retirement needs to be revamped for what we actually get after 20 years.

The Reserve Components are not what they used to be. It’s not BBQs and drinking on the weekends anymore. It’s high OPTEMPO with 29 days orders to JRTC/NTC and constant activations/deployments.

It’s time for the benefits to keep up with the current environmental/economic landscape.

That’s true, but getting 100% is a battle in it of itself. I would rather just take the TRICARE immediately after 20 years and lock it in. Hell, I’ll even pay for it like I do already, just let me have it after I do the 20.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - May 17, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Currently, Dr. Bono is the CEO of Medical iSight, a 3D imaging and guidance software company for intra-procedural navigational guidance. Previously, she was the chief health officer for Viking Cruises, establishing an industry-leading C-suite model that re-started and sustained the cruise line during the COVID-19 Global Pandemic. Before Viking, she was a gubernatorial appointee as the director of Washington State COVID-19 Health System Response Management, subsequently leading the state’s Pandemic Health Response.

She is a senior fellow with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. As the former chief executive officer (CEO) and director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Dr. Bono led a joint, integrated combat support agency that enabled all branches of the U.S. military—Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines —medical services to provide health care services to combatant commands. She integrated an unprecedented $50 billion worldwide health care enterprise composed of 50 hospitals and 300 clinical facilities that provide care to 9.5 million military beneficiaries; oversaw the Department of Defense (DoD) deployment of the electronic health record (EHR) system; and advanced the development of an integrated health system with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Dr. Bono’s leadership positions in the DoD include: CEO/director, DHA (2015-2019); CEO/director, National Capital Region Medical Directorate (2013-2015); acting commander, Joint Task Force (JTF), National Capital Region (2013); command surgeon, U.S. Pacific Command (2011-2013); chief of staff, TRICARE, DoD (2008-2010); commanding officer (CEO), Naval Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida (2005-2008); and was deployed to the first Gulf War as head of casualty receiving, Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm (1990-1991).

She received her bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas, Austin, her Master of Business Administration from Washington State University, Spokane and her medical degree from Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Lubbock. She completed her surgical internship and residency at the Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, Virginia, and performed a trauma and critical care fellowship at the Eastern Virginia Graduate School of Medicine, Norfolk, Virginia.

“Dr. Bono is a pioneering leader in military medicine, a national healthcare strategist, and someone who has made a career of stepping up when the stakes are highest,” said Salus at Drexel president Michael H. Mittelman, OD ‘80, MBA, MBA FAAO, FACHE. “From the battlefield to the boardroom, from military hospitals to international business, Dr. Bono has consistently demonstrated what true leadership looks like—visionary, compassionate, and unflinching in the face of complexity.”
