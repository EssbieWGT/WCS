When you see a child therapist who is in-network with Tricare, each session you’ll pay only a copay, which typically ranges from $0-$75/session. Depending on your plan, you may first need to pay the provider’s full session fee until you meet your annual deductible, which is the total amount of medical expenses required before your health insurance starts to cover costs. Some plans cover the cost of in-network therapy sessions before the deductible is met; to verify whether your specific plan covers therapy sessions and at what rate, visit the Tricare website or call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask about your coverage for outpatient mental health.

To sum it up, if you go with Tricare Prime, you will need a diagnosis code on the authorization from your PCM for every little thing. For example, I work at a GI and colorectal clinic, and if a patient with Prime comes in for hemorrhoids and then also mentions wanting to be seen for constipation, then the patient will need an updated Tricare authorization to include the diagnosis code for constipation. Hopefully that makes sense. With Tricare Select, there is typically some copay, but you do not need a referral/authorization to go to the doctor so long as the practice accepts Tricare Select.

There are certain times you may need to file your own claims with WPS Government Services, the TFL contractor. Here’s what you need to know about when to file claims when you have Medicare and TFL.

“Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your military ID card at any medical appointment for a smooth claims process,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Who files my claims?

In most cases, your provider files your health care claims with Medicare first. Medicare pays its share and sends the claim to WPS for processing and payment of TRICARE’s portion of the claim.

Sometimes, you’ll need to file your own claim with WPS. This happens when:

TRICARE is your primary insurance.

Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

You have other health insurance.

What you need for filing claims

When you file a claim, include:

Patient’s Request for Medical Payment (DD Form 2642)

Medicare Summary Notice

Your OHI explanation of benefits (if you have OHI)

Provider’s bill with all required information

Required information on bills

Make sure your provider’s bill shows:

Your name

Provider’s name and address

Date and place of service

Description of services

Charges for each service

Diagnosis

Filing deadlines

You have one year from the date of service to file claims in the U.S, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook. Send claims to the WPS mailing address.

Filing claims overseas

When you get care overseas, TRICARE pays first (unless you have OHI). Medicare doesn’t pay for overseas care.

You must submit proof of payment with all overseas claims. This can be:

Credit card receipts

Canceled checks

Credit card statements

Provider invoices showing payment

File overseas claims where you received care. You have three years from the date of service to file these claims.

How do I get help?

This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.

BizSense Beat is a weekly collaboration between VPM News and Richmond BizSense that recaps the region’s top business stories.

This week, BizSense’s Jonathan Spiers joins host Lyndon German to discuss unexpectedly rejected plans for a proposed housing development in Henrico County’s Three Chopt District.

Lyndon and Jonathan also talk about the likely exclusion of a 93-acre plot — the former Best Products headquarters near Interstate 95 and Parham Road — from Henrico’s next post–GreenCity development plan.

Well, first: We didn’t plan it this way. It’s just what happened.

On Tuesday, Billy Shields recounted the Tale of the Charter Colony Turkey — a potentially foul fowl (or fowl…s?) that is harassing and delighting commuters in Chesterfield County.

Don’t forget—the deadlines for Airmen and Guardians to sign up for 2026 health, dental, and vision benefits are quickly approaching.

Tricare open season ends Dec. 9 for health care coverage starting Jan. 1. Open season for Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program ends Dec. 8.

Tricare offers two main health plan options: Tricare Prime and Tricare Select, according to Tricare’s Open Season page.

Tricare Prime: For individuals and families that prefer a primary care manager, or PCM, to oversee their care and want predictable costs. No deductible; just co-payment for most services. No copayments for active-duty family members. Referrals are required for most specialty care.

Tricare Select: Offers more flexibility for Airmen and Guardians. There’s no PCM and participants can see any Tricare-authorized provider they choose. No referrals are necessary for primary care and most specialty care. There is an annual deductible as well as co-payments or cost shares.

Airmen and Guardians living in the Atlanta, Ga., or Tampa, Fla., metropolitan area may want to consider signing up for the Tricare Prime Demo, an option designed to offer more options for eligible participants than the standard Tricare Prime plan, the Defense Health Agency announced in May. Interested participants have until Dec. 9 to sign up through Tricare Open Season. Coverage starts Jan. 1.

The Tricare Prime Demo plan, managed by CareSource Military & Veterans, doesn’t require participants get referrals to see network providers and offers virtual health services and a 24/7 nurse advice line, according to the May announcement. Go to the TRICARE Prime Demo to check eligibility and view details.

For dental and vision, the eligibility for the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP, has expanded to include “certain retired uniformed service members, active-duty family members, and survivors,” according to benefeds.gov. The site allows enrollees to check their eligibility, compare premiums and benefits, and estimate in-network and out-of-network service costs.

Airmen and Guardians may also consider opening a health care or dependent care flexible spending account, or FSA, during Tricare Open Season depending on their family’s needs. The Internal Revenue Service allows participants to contribute up to $3,400 pre-tax income into a healthcare FSA each year to cover expenses such as co-payments, vision and dental exams, eyeglasses, and braces, according to fsafeds.gov. But participants can only carry over up to $680 from one plan year to the next.

A dependent care FSA allows participants to use pre-tax income to pay for eligible dependent care services such as preschool, summer day camp, before or after-school programs, and child or adult day care. The IRS allows participants who are single, head of household, or married couples filing joint tax returns to contribute up to $7,500 per year, according to fsafeds.gov. Participants who are married, filing separate tax returns can contribute up to $3,750 per year.

The Air Force Aid Society announced plans in June to streamline the application process for financial aid to offer more assistance to Airmen and Guardians manage the costs of health care, child care and other expensive necessities.

Through the Department of Defense, Tricare offers health plans to uniformed service members, retirees and their families. CareSource Military and Veterans President Holly Joers explained to Becker’s how the insurer is getting in on the action.

So far, the plan has taken one big step to ease administrative burden and boost care access: Eliminating referrals for in-network care.

In Tricare Prime, members often have to work with their primary care manager — their main provider — to get a referral for specialty care, get that referral approved by a regional contractor and then wait to hear back before they can book an appointment. CareSource evaluated whether any legal obstacles stood in the way and decided to axe the process.

“It was a no-brainer,” Ms. Joers said. “This makes sense to us. Can we do it logistically? Yes. Are there any barriers statutorily? No.”

She said CareSource chose Tampa as an initial market because of its healthcare infrastructure, a military base that draws service members and a retiree population. Integrated Home Care Services will act as one of the plan’s partners in Florida. The insurer will also offer the plan in Atlanta. Ms. Joers noted that both areas have “strong military and veteran communities, robust healthcare infrastructure and a wide variety of population needs.”

As for other insurers considering entering the Tricare market, Ms. Joers sees an opportunity.

“We’re hearing a lot from the government now about wanting to bring more commercial entities into the space,” she said.

In terms of what next steps Ms. Joers sees for CareSource’s Tricare push, she said she is “expecting there to be an opportunity to compete for more locations, so we’re excited to be able to do that and just continue to build on this managed care, integrated care model.”",https://www.beckerspayer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/payer-og-image.png,N,1.0,2025-12-05 20:56:43.608573

MEADE, Md.– Fort Meade Medical Department Activity (MEDDAC) leaders and staff celebrated the newest DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses honorees during a ceremony held at the Fort Meade MEDDAC Headquarters on Fort Meade, Maryland, Dec. 5, 2025.

Virginia Peters, Lynnette Petty, and Army Spc. Steven Miller were selected from 35 nominations to receive the award.

The DAISY award, which stands for Diseases Attacking the Immune System, recognizes nurses who provide exceptional care and compassion by collecting nominations from patients, families, and co-workers.

Leaders at the ceremony emphasized the impact and importance of the award in the nursing profession.

“The DAISY award is a special award because it reminds us of why many of us joined this profession in the first place,” said Army Lt. Col. Derral W. Prowant, Kimbrough’s chief nursing officer. “Healing is more than medicine. It is connection, trust, and presence.”

“The DAISY Award is so special because it’s not a top-down award,” said Army Col. Louis Magyar III, Fort Meade MEDDAC’s deputy commander for nursing. “To be recognized by our patients–by the people that we care for and that they’ve entrusted us to care for them–is probably one of the most [important] recognitions that you could ever receive as a healthcare provider,” Maygar added.

Peters, a registered nurse at the Dunham Army Health Clinic, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, was nominated by a patient after Peters provided thorough patient support during appointments, addressed concerns, and enhanced the patient’s understanding with a home medical device. Peters made the patient feel valued and cared for throughout the process. “She is undoubtedly one of the best nurses that I have ever experienced,” according to the patient.

Petty, a licensed practical nurse at Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, Fort Meade, Maryland, was nominated by a grateful patient who highlighted Petty’s “outstanding professionalism,” sharing that she “immediately took actions” and even escorted them to the pharmacy to secure a time-sensitive prescription. The patient called her support “above and beyond” and credited her “compassion and determination” for resolving the issue.

Miller, a combat medic specialist at Kirk Army Health Clinic, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, was nominated by a patient who commended Miller for being “an exceptional medic” whose professionalism and thorough review of hospital notes and history showed “the absolute intent of getting me [the patient] help.” The patient added that he is a credit to his profession and to Kirk Army Health Clinic.

The DAISY Award is part of an international program that celebrates nurses who go above and beyond to provide exceptional patient care. Nominees are selected based on patient, family, and staff submissions describing meaningful moments of clinical excellence and compassion.

Winners received a certificate, pin, and “The Healer’s Touch” serpentine stone sculpture, which is hand-carved by artists of the Shona Tribe in Zimbabwe who hold their traditional healers in high esteem.

The DAISY Foundation was established in November 1999 by the family of J. Patrick Barnes who died Age 33 of complications of an autoimmune disease known as Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.

The company also allegedly paid commissions to certain independent contractor marketers based on the volume and value of referrals to ensure that doctors order NEXT laboratory tests.

The anti-kickback statute prohibits offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded health care programs, per the DOJ.

The Defense Health Agency announced Nov. 13 that three military hospitals from Defense Health Network Central earned Leapfrog's Top Hospital recognition for fall 2025.

Bassett Army Community Hospital earned honors for a second year in a row, along with new honors for Osan Air Base's 51st Medical Group and Yokota Air Base's 374th Medical Group.

""Receiving the Leapfrog Top Hospital Award is a remarkable achievement and a testament to DHN Central MTFs’ unwavering commitment to patient safety and the exceptional quality of care you provide to our patients,"" said Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central. ""This prestigious designation recognizes the outstanding performance in critical areas such as error prevention and superior outcomes, setting these MTFs apart as three of only 12 MTFs across the enterprise to receive the recognition in 2025.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

Leapfrog's Top Hospital award recognizes the highest-performing hospitals on the Leapfrog Hospital Survey, identifying those with strong performance in patient safety and quality. Hospitals are recognized across four categories: general, teaching, rural, and children's hospitals, and must achieve an ""A"" grade in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade to be eligible. These hospitals demonstrate superior systems for preventing medication errors, higher quality maternity care, and lower infection rates, among other standards, according to the Leapfrog Group’s website.

Bassett Army Community Hospital

This honor marks Bassett's second consecutive year receiving the Top Hospital honor.

""Our team at Bassett Army Community Hospital not only strives to deliver safe, quality care, but we do it the right way – through teamwork, professionalism, and mutual support across sections,"" said Air Force Col. Benjamin Donham, Bassett Army Community Hospital commander.

""Being recognized for earning the Leapfrog Top Hospital for the second year in a row shows the commitment our team has to our community, beneficiaries, and each other.""'

Osan Air Base Hospital

""We are immensely proud that Osan Air Base Hospital is recognized as a Leapfrog Top Hospital. This prestigious designation is a testament to the unwavering dedication and commitment of our entire staff who worked diligently and collaboratively to meet and exceed the stringent national standards,"" said Air Force Col. Amanda L. Siangco, 51st Medical Group director.

""This achievement underscores our ongoing commitment to providing the highest quality and safest care to our patients and the community we serve.""

Yokota Military Hospital also made the fall ""honor roll.""

""Yokota Air Base Hospital's prestigious selection as a Leapfrog Top Hospital belongs entirely to its remarkable team,"" said Air Force Col. Graham I. Warden, 474th Medical Group director. ""It was their tireless hard work, seamless collaboration, and relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and the highest standards that made this national recognition possible.""

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation fosters transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and health care systems, leading to continual process improvement.

“This recognition reflects your tireless efforts, represents the highest standards of excellence, and reflects positively on our entire Network, the Defense Health Agency, and the Military Health System.

Individuals need to be aware of specific dates for the Tricare open season and the Federal Benefits Open Season to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare options.

Tricare Open Season

The Tricare open season will conclude on Tuesday, December 9, at midnight Eastern Standard Time. During this period, beneficiaries have the opportunity to make essential changes to their Tricare healthcare plans, including the option to switch between Tricare Prime and Tricare Select. It is recommended that beneficiaries visit tricare.mil/openseason to compare costs and plans, with online enrollment available through the Beneficiary Web Enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil.

For those who do not make any changes during this open season, the next opportunity to alter their plan will not occur until next year’s open season or following a qualifying life event, such as a birth. It’s crucial for beneficiaries to verify their information by checking the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System at tricare.mil/deers.

This year’s open season introduces a notable change for beneficiaries residing in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida metropolitan areas. A demonstration project will offer a Tricare Prime option without the requirement of referrals to in-network specialists, a significant shift that aims to enhance access to healthcare services. New coverage or changes selected will become effective on January 1, 2026.

The Tricare open season applies to individuals currently enrolled or eligible for various Tricare plans, including Tricare Prime and Tricare Select. Notably, individual active-duty service members and beneficiaries enrolled in Tricare for Life are exempt from this open season, as their coverage is automatically granted for those with Medicare Part A and Part B. Those eligible for premium-based plans like Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve can enroll at any time throughout the year.

Dental, Vision, and Tax-Saving Accounts

The Federal Benefits Open Season will end on Monday, December 8, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Eligible military community members can enroll in dental and vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) at www.benefeds.gov. Additionally, service members can enroll in tax-savings accounts during this period, including a healthcare flexible spending account and a dependent care flexible spending account. These accounts allow individuals to set aside pre-tax dollars for healthcare costs not covered by Tricare and additional expenses associated with child care. It is important to note that previous participation does not automatically carry over, requiring new enrollment each year.

New Tricare Prime Demonstration

Starting in 2026, approximately 150,000 Tricare beneficiaries in the Atlanta and Tampa areas will gain access to the new Tricare Prime demonstration project initiated by the Defense Health Agency. Beneficiaries who wish to participate must enroll during the open season. Further information can be obtained by visiting enrolltricare.com or by calling 877-996-9333.

The CareSource Military and Veterans Company, based in Dayton, Ohio, will manage the three-year demonstration project under contracts totaling $110 million. This initiative will serve active-duty family members, family members of activated National Guard or Reserve members, retirees, and certain other individuals not eligible for Medicare. A key benefit of this new option is the elimination of referral requirements for in-network specialty care.

Feedback from beneficiaries regarding the Tricare Prime demonstration has been largely positive, particularly concerning the new allowance to access specialists without referrals. CareSource aims to provide robust support, helping families navigate healthcare options and appointments.

For military families seeking to optimize their healthcare coverage for the upcoming year, adhering to these deadlines and exploring the available options is essential for ensuring comprehensive and accessible medical services.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Upcoming-Health-Care-Enrollment-Deadlines-for-US-Military-Community.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-05 13:56:47.208840

Clear and dependable communication is essential for military families stationed abroad,” said Congressman Bacon.
“Our military readiness depends upon our operational readiness, and this commonsense bipartisan bill will strengthen both.” “When military families receive the right information at the right time, they stay resilient, informed, and mission ready,” Rep. Horsford said.
I’m proud to partner with Representatives Houlahan, Bacon, Kiggans, Goodlander and Wittman to help give military families the consistent, direct, and timely communication they deserve.” “Ensuring that our service members have access to reliable, consistent communication is essential for military readiness.
For those stationed in Okinawa, timely updates can make all the difference in their day-to-day lives and provide stability for their families.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA), along with original co-sponsors Representatives Steven Horsford (D-NV), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Don Bacon (R-NE), and Rob Wittman (R-VA), introduced the Improving Notification for Operational Readiness and Families (INFORM) Act, a bipartisan bill directing the Department of Defense (DoD) to establish a pilot program to deliver timely, mission-critical information directly to servicemembers and military families stationed at Marine Corps Installations Pacific in Okinawa, Japan.

Under the bill, DoD will automatically enroll eligible servicemembers and adult dependents to receive text messages providing updates on spouse employment opportunities, childcare availability, TRICARE benefits, and Department-wide policy changes. The initiative, which provides the option to opt out, aims to streamline communication and reduce reliance on fragmented channels such as social media, newsletters, and installation-specific platforms.

The bill also directs DoD to report to Congress by October 1, 2027, on participation, outcomes, costs, and whether the program should be expanded Department-wide. By consolidating routine updates into a single, efficient push-text system, the initiative is expected to reduce duplicative outreach efforts and improve long-term communication efficiency.

“Military families deserve clear, consistent, and reliable communication, especially those stationed overseas,” said Representative Chrissy Houlahan. “Our bill ensures that servicemembers and their families on Okinawa get the information they need directly to their phones, without having to dig through multiple systems or outdated channels. As a former Air Force officer and daughter of a naval officer, I know how much this simple, modern approach to getting timely information can improve quality of life and readiness.”

""Having served overseas with my own family, I know firsthand that clear and timely communication can make all the difference. Whether it’s childcare availability, TRICARE updates, or family resources, our servicemembers stationed in Okinawa deserve information they can rely on. The Push-Text Initiative will deliver that support directly to their phones, strengthening both family stability and mission readiness,” said Congresswoman Kiggans.

“Our servicemembers and their families are relying on increasingly diverse sources of information, and they deserve to be met where they are at. Clear and dependable communication is essential for military families stationed abroad,” said Congressman Bacon. “I’m pleased to co-lead the INFORM Act with Rep. Houlahan, to establish a DoD pilot delivering timely and relevant text updates to servicemembers and dependents in Okinawa. I am hopeful that the success of this program will lead to adoption across the force.”

“When America’s servicemembers answer the call to serve our country overseas, military families serve right alongside them. They need and deserve clear, reliable communication they can count on, especially when they are thousands of miles from home,” said Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander. “Our military readiness depends upon our operational readiness, and this commonsense bipartisan bill will strengthen both.”

“When military families receive the right information at the right time, they stay resilient, informed, and mission ready,” Rep. Horsford said. “If we can track flights, packages, and banking in real time, families should be able to track TRICARE deadlines and childcare openings just as easily. The pilot program we’re proposing today does just that, proving that smart, modern communication doesn’t have to be complicated, and that small changes can have big quality-of-life benefits for service members and their families. I’m proud to partner with Representatives Houlahan, Bacon, Kiggans, Goodlander and Wittman to help give military families the consistent, direct, and timely communication they deserve.”

“Ensuring that our service members have access to reliable, consistent communication is essential for military readiness. For those stationed in Okinawa, timely updates can make all the difference in their day-to-day lives and provide stability for their families. I’m proud to cosponsor the INFORM Act, which will ensure that the brave men and women serving our nation, as well as their families, have access to the resources they need to stay informed and connected,” said Congressman Wittman.

The proposal also carries significant national security implications. During major contingency scenarios, such as a crisis involving China, commercial communications systems in Okinawa could be disrupted. By building a controlled, state-side-managed communications capability, the bill lays the groundwork for a more resilient information pipeline that can operate even if local infrastructure is compromised. “This bipartisan pilot is a crucial step toward making sure no family is left without critical updates when it matters most. That’s not just good communication policy, its readiness,” Representative Chrissy Houlahan said.

During that period, CVS pharmacies: Dispensed quantities of insulin exceeding prescription directions.
DCIS Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Silvestro reaffirmed that investigating false claims against TRICARE remains a top priority.
Resolution and Oversight As part of the settlement, CVS admitted to the conduct alleged in the government’s complaint and accepted responsibility.
In addition to the government’s complaint, five private whistleblower lawsuits were joined under the False Claims Act.","The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has announced a $37.76 million settlement with CVS Pharmacy, Inc. to resolve allegations that the company violated the False Claims Act by over-dispensing insulin pens and improperly billing federal health care programs.

The settlement, approved by US District Judge John G. Koeltl, includes $24.4 million to be paid to the United States, with the remaining funds distributed to participating states.

CVS admitted to dispensing more insulin to patients than prescribed, submitting premature refill claims, and under-reporting days-of-supply data to secure reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

Findings and Admissions

According to the US Attorney’s Office, the conduct occurred between 2010 and 2020. During that period, CVS pharmacies:

Dispensed quantities of insulin exceeding prescription directions.

Refilled prescriptions prematurely, before patients had used prior supplies.

Reported inaccurate days-of-supply on reimbursement claims, preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from detecting early refills.

Failed to follow PBM rules requiring overrides or resubmissions with accurate supply data.

CVS management was aware of audit findings showing violations related to premature refills and inaccurate reporting but did not implement adequate corrective actions during the covered period.

CVS admitted that its pharmacies sometimes did not break open insulin pen cartons, leading to dispensing amounts beyond plan limits, and that its auto-refill system occasionally generated premature refill notifications based on inaccurate supply data.

Statements from Federal Officials

US Attorney Jay Clayton described CVS’s conduct as a “decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions”, noting that the company’s failure to follow appropriate refill schedules increased costs for government programs and wasted taxpayer funds.

He emphasized that the settlement “reflects our continued commitment to holding pharmacies to account, enforcing rules designed to keep costs down, and protecting taxpayer dollars.”

Officials from the HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), and the Office of Personnel Management OIG (OPM-OIG) underscored the importance of compliance with federal billing standards:

HHS-OIG’s Naomi D. Gruchacz stated that federal health programs depend on accurate billing and responsible reimbursement practices.

DCIS Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Silvestro reaffirmed that investigating false claims against TRICARE remains a top priority.

OPM-OIG Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt noted that false claims for unnecessary insulin refills “exploit benefits that federal employees rely on to manage their health.”

Background on Insulin Dispensing Practices

The case centered on insulin pens, which are packaged in five-pen cartons, each containing 300 units of insulin. Pharmacies are required to report the quantity dispensed and days-of-supply when seeking reimbursement.

Government health care programs and PBMs limit the days-of-supply that can be billed (often 30 days) and deny premature refill claims. These safeguards depend on accurate pharmacy reporting.

The government alleged that CVS manipulated or misreported supply data, which prevented PBMs from detecting violations. The result was over-dispensing, leading some patients to accumulate unused and potentially expired insulin.

Resolution and Oversight

As part of the settlement, CVS admitted to the conduct alleged in the government’s complaint and accepted responsibility. The company will pay $37.76 million in total.

First, for 2026, the Soldier will pay premiums of $57.88 for an individual plan or $286.66 for a family plan. The premium is the monthly amount paid for the insurance.

Second, the deductible varies by rank. For E-4 and below, the deductible is $66 for an individual or $132 for a family. For E-5 and above, the individual deductible is $198 and the family deductible is $397. A deductible is the amount that the Soldier pays before Tricare pays anything.

Third, once the deductible is met, cost-sharing kicks in. The amounts vary by the type of provider, but as an example, primary care visits are $19. Specialty care is $33. Urgent care is $26, etc. See the link below for costs.

Fourth, there is a catastrophic cap. This means that once the service member has paid a certain amount of money for care (deductible, copays, etc.), then everything is covered at 100%. The catastrophic cap for TRS next year is $1324.

If you want to explain to a Soldier how it all works, make sure and let them know that total out of pocket costs for the year would be 12 months of premiums, plus the catastrophic cap. For example, a junior enlisted would pay $694.56 in premiums ($57.88 x 12 months), plus the catastrophic cap of $1324, for a total annual out of pocket cost of $2018.56.

Its also important to note that prescription costs count towards the deductible and catastrophic cap. Some health plans have a separate deductible for prescriptions.

Dental is separate and is through Tricare United Concordia Dental Plan.

A Virginia-based clinical laboratory will pay at least $758,000 to resolve federal allegations that it funneled illegal kickbacks to physicians and marketers to generate test referrals. Prosecutors say NEXT Molecular Analytics disguised improper payments as consulting or medical director fees for doctors in Texas and Arkansas, while also compensating independent marketers based on the volume and value of test orders — actions that allegedly led to claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE.

Newly synthesized fungal compound shows early promise against pediatric brain cancer

MIT chemists have, for the first time, created verticillin A in the lab — a notoriously complex fungal molecule that has intrigued cancer researchers for decades. With reliable access to the compound, the team was able to design sturdier versions that Dana-Farber scientists then tested in diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a devastating childhood brain cancer with limited treatment options. Some of these derivatives were strikingly effective at killing DMG cells, particularly those driven by high EZHIP expression.

While the work, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, is still at a very early stage, researchers say having a practical way to make and modify verticillin A opens the door to deeper studies.

Study projects climate-driven sleep loss by 2099

Nighttime heat may become a significant public health stressor, according to a large analysis from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, published in Environment International, that links rising temperatures to shorter and more fragmented sleep in U.S. adults. Using more than 12 million FitBit-recorded nights from over 14,000 participants, investigators found that a 10°C (50°F) rise in nighttime temperatures corresponded to 2.6 minutes of lost sleep, with disproportionate effects among women, Hispanic individuals, people with chronic illness and those of lower socioeconomic status.

U.S. college students are reaching adulthood at a time when the affordability of healthcare and health insurance is a growing concern.

According to a recent Gallup poll, 47% of U.S. adults are concerned about affording healthcare in 2026, the highest percentage since West Health and Gallup began polling for this measure in 2021.

“One in five Americans — also a record high — report that they or someone in their household couldn’t pay for prescription medications in the past three months,” the website reads. “These are merely two of countless healthcare hurdles Americans face.”

Even for college students, these statistics on paper can quickly become reality. Sugar Land sophomore Coralee Heyden said she discovered that her family had recently lost their insurance coverage while buying prescription medicine from CVS Pharmacy.

“It is too expensive for me,” Heyden said. “What am I going to do? Just not get it? Let my grades suffer? It’s not an option. I’m sitting there in my head going over, ‘OK, how many things will I have to save up for the next few months until I can find a job for myself?’”

But Heyden said she was not the only one struggling at the CVS Pharmacy counter that day. She was struck by the “cold reality” of the current healthcare system in the U.S.

“This one lady next to me, she’s trying to get her own medication that I think she needs probably just to survive … but she’s taking a long time in the line, and the lines piling up, and she’s apologizing to the people behind her while also trying to figure out why her payment’s not processing through there,” Heyden said.

Heyden said she had not given much thought to rising healthcare costs until she became responsible for her own, and she thinks other students should consider their healthcare costs as well.

“Ask your parents about their insurance plan, I would say, try and get that sorted out,” Heyden said. “You never know when you’re going to end up needing that information, and you’re going to feel stupid when you don’t have it, because you are an adult now.”

Baylor Health Services Insurance Claims Coordinator Lisa Bland said she has noticed insurance costs rising each academic year.

“We work with Academic HealthPlans to work with Blue Cross Blue Shield to see what we can do to lower those costs, and the rising cost of healthcare is kind of out of control,” Bland said. “We hate it.”

Bland said Baylor offers the Baylor University Student Health Insurance Plan, administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, to be affordable to students.

“It’s widely taken all over the United States, so even our online students can use this if they live in other areas, or if students go on vacation or go back home and they’re not from here, they can still use it,” Bland said. “It’s got a low $500 deductible. Office visits are $35. Specialist visits are $45. Lab x-rays, procedures, whatnot, are covered at 80%. There’s prescription coverages dubbed by tiers.”

If an incoming student has an outside insurance provider, Bland said she would encourage them to call the member services number on the back of their insurance card to make sure they are networked with Baylor.

“While we’re networked with most major plans, even the major insurers, Cigna, Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, will still have some one-off plans for certain employers that have a very small network, and we may not be a part of them,” Bland said. “So we do encourage that. We don’t like to surprise anybody with a bill that they didn’t expect.”

However, she said Health Services offers a self-pay discount plan to students who come with coverage that Baylor is not in network with or that does not provide out-of-state coverage, which takes 40% off the charges for services that are not vaccines and do not involve an outside lab.

“We started that spring break almost two years ago because we did notice we had a lot of students from California with Kaiser, and we are currently not in network with TRICARE,” Bland said. “We have a lot of TRICARE students, and some TRICARE plans will pay visits here, but most will not. We wanted to have them a lower-cost option.”

Even for those without student insurance or those who are self-paid, Bland said the Health Center tries to keep rates as low as possible.

“We just need to keep our lights on,” Bland said. “We’re not going to make a profit, but we just really try to just kind of cover everything we have to cover and still keep our rates low.”",https://baylorlariat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BPH05164.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-05 07:56:56.596018

Tricare open season

Tuesday, Dec. 9: The Tricare open season ends at midnight Eastern Standard Time. Beneficiaries can make changes to their Tricare health care plan, such as switching from Tricare Prime to Tricare Select. Visit tricare.mil/openseason to compare costs and plans and enroll. Online enrollment is also available through the Beneficiary Web Enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil.

If beneficiaries don’t make changes now, the next chance is open season next year or a qualifying life event such as a birth.

This open season also includes a new option for beneficiaries in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, metropolitan areas through a demonstration project that provides a Tricare Prime option that doesn’t require referrals to in-network specialists. Find more details below.

The new coverage or changes in coverage made during open season for Tricare and other federal programs take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

Beneficiaries can check if their information is up to date in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System online at tricare.mil.deers.

Those who are satisfied with their health care plan don’t need to take action.

Tricare open season applies to those currently enrolled in or eligible for Tricare Prime, Tricare Prime Remote, U.S. Family Health Plan, Tricare Prime Demonstration Project, Tricare Prime Overseas, Tricare Prime Remote Overseas, Tricare Select and Tricare Select Overseas.

The open season doesn’t apply to individual active-duty service members or beneficiaries enrolled in Tricare for Life, where coverage is automatic for those who have Medicare Part A and Part B.

Those eligible for the premium-based plans — Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve and Tricare Young Adult — can purchase the plans at any time of the year.

What troops, military families need to know about Tricare open season

Dental, vision and tax-saving accounts

Monday, Dec. 8: The Federal Benefits Open Season ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Those eligible in the military community can enroll in dental coverage and vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP. Visit www.benefeds.gov for more information and to enroll. This open season ends a day earlier than the Tricare open season.

Monday, Dec. 8: As part of the Federal Benefits Open Season, service members can enroll in tax-savings accounts: a health care flexible spending account and a dependent care flexible spending account. These pre-tax accounts allow troops to set aside up to $3,400 in 2026 to pay for health care costs that Tricare doesn’t cover. Dependent care flexible spending accounts help defray the costs of child care and other dependent care. The Internal Revenue Service allows individuals to set aside up to $7,500 per year for dependent care costs if they are married and file a joint tax return or if they file as single or head of household. Visit fsafeds.gov for more information and to enroll.

Previous participation in these flexible spending programs doesn’t automatically carry over, meaning individuals must must enroll each year.

New Tricare Prime demo starts in 2026

Roughly 150,000 Tricare beneficiaries living in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, metropolitan areas will have a new Tricare Prime option next year through a demonstration project being conducted by the Defense Health Agency.

Those interested must enroll during open season. For more information and to enroll, visit enrolltricare.com, or call 877-996-9333 from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday. Those eligible can also enroll through the web enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil by searching for Tricare Prime demo.

Information was not available about how many beneficiaries have signed up to date for the demonstration project.

CareSource Military and Veterans Co., of Dayton, Ohio, will run three-year demonstration projects for the two areas, under contracts worth a combined total of $110 million.

Those eligible are active-duty family members; family members of activated National Guard or Reserve members; retirees, their family members or survivors who aren’t eligible for Medicare; and those enrolled in the Transitional Compensation Program.

A key benefit for those enrolled in Tricare Prime through this project is that they won’t be required to get referrals for in-network specialty care, as is normally required in Tricare Prime.

“We’ve received positive feedback from beneficiaries enrolling in the Tricare Prime demo … especially regarding their ability to see in-network specialists without referrals,” CareSource officials said in a statement to Military Times. “Many beneficiaries also indicated that maintaining their providers and comprehensive coverage was an important factor in their decision.”

For the first year of the demonstration project, enrollment fees are waived for retirees, their family members and survivors. Active-duty service members, their family members and transitional survivors don’t pay Tricare Prime enrollment fees.

While those in Tricare Select currently don’t have to get referrals, they could choose to switch to the Tricare Prime demo option which doesn’t require referrals and also provides the additional benefit of case management and care coordination for those who need it.

CareSource will help Tricare families navigate finding a provider, getting an appointment and providing more hands-on personal support.

CareSource Military and Veterans is part of CareSource, a national nonprofit managed care organization with more than 2 million members.",https://www.navycrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-12-05 06:56:42.744447

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member and former chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement in response to reporting in MS NOW that House Speaker Mike Johnson is working behind the scenes to strip a provision—based on legislation Senator Murray helped introduce earlier this year— that would mandate TRICARE health care coverage for fertility services, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty servicemembers.

“Right now, servicemembers who risk their lives for our country can’t get the same IVF coverage that’s available to other federal employees—that’s plain wrong, and it’s outrageous that once again, Speaker Johnson and his anti-abortion allies are standing in the way of a simple legislative fix. Members of the military face a higher rate of infertility often because of their service to our country, but Republicans want to deny these servicemembers the ability to grow their families.

“Speaker Johnson is among the most extreme anti-abortion radicals in Congress who believes embryos should have the same rights as living, breathing human beings—it’s disgraceful but not surprising that he is working behind the scenes to force servicemembers to suffer through infertility rather than grow their families through IVF.

“I’ll keep pushing to protect every servicemember’s right to IVF—and Donald Trump, who purports to support IVF, should join with Democrats to protect this provision.”

In April, Senator Murray joined Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) in introducing the IVF for Military Families Act, new bicameral legislation that would require TRICARE—which provides health coverage to active duty military servicemembers, retirees, and their families—to cover fertility services, including IVF, for servicemembers and their families. The Senate-passed NDAA included a provision that mirrors the IVF for Military Families Act—Speaker Johnson is reportedly working to remove that provision from the final NDAA legislation.

As the daughter of a disabled World War II veteran, Senator Murray knows firsthand the sacrifice that military service demands and has been fighting for over a decade to expand access to IVF care and other fertility services for veterans and servicemembers, and to protect servicemembers’ and veterans’ access to the reproductive care they deserve. She has introduced multiple pieces of legislation to address the challenges veterans face when starting a family after their service, and in 2012, Senator Murray secured Senate passage of a provision to end the ban on IVF services at VA.

Senator Murray has helped lead the charge in the Senate to protect IVF from Republican attacks for the millions of Americans—including servicemembers and veterans—who rely on it to grow their families. Last Congress, Murray introduced the Right to IVF Act in the Senate—which would establish a nationwide right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (ART) and lower the costs of IVF treatment for middle-class families, and includes the Veteran Families Health Services Act. Despite many Republicans publicly claiming to support IVF, nearly every Senate Republican voted against the Right to IVF Act on two separate occasions last year. Overall, Republicans blocked legislation that would protect IVF nationwide three separate times last year.
