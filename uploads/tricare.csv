In an email sent August 26 to The Dallas Express, DHA acknowledged receiving a request for records.
“We regret the substantial delay in processing requests,” DHA’s FOIA analyst wrote in the interim response.
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed in 1967, states that “all federal agencies are required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business days, unless there are ‘unusual circumstances,'” per the Department of Justice website.
The agency’s handling of FOIA requests echoes similar struggles across the federal government.","The Defense Health Agency says it is so backlogged with Freedom of Information Act requests that it cannot meet the law’s 20-day deadline.

In an email sent August 26 to The Dallas Express, DHA acknowledged receiving a request for records. However, the FOIA agent said the request was number 950 out of 951 open cases and estimated a completion date of October 8, 2025 — roughly three weeks after the statutory deadline.

“We regret the substantial delay in processing requests,” DHA’s FOIA analyst wrote in the interim response.

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed in 1967, states that “all federal agencies are required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business days, unless there are ‘unusual circumstances,'” per the Department of Justice website. The unusual circumstances include situations where it will take an exceptional amount of time to collect records from field offices, requests for large amounts of documents, or those that require consultation with another agency.

Delays are now common, and transparency advocates warn that mounting backlogs weaken the law’s role as a tool for public oversight of federal agencies.

Federal News Network has reported that FOIA offices across the government are chronically underfunded and understaffed, despite receiving a record 900,000 requests in fiscal 2022.

“FOIA offices have traditionally been understaffed and underbudgeted,” Marshall Hamilton, an executive at Tyler Technologies, told the outlet. He added that shortages are “a big reason why these [FOIA] backlogs are increasing governmentwide.”

The Defense Health Agency manages health care delivery for 9.5 million beneficiaries worldwide through TRICARE and serves as a medical combat support agency to the Army, Navy, and Air Force, according to the agency website. Its FOIA office is based in Falls Church, Virginia, and processes requests for multiple subcomponents, including Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System.

The agency’s handling of FOIA requests echoes similar struggles across the federal government.

On July 8, the Federal Communications Commission agreed to expedite the processing of an earlier records request from The Dallas Express due to a “compelling need” to inform the public about government affairs. Seven weeks later, the special government process intended to produce records quickly has still not produced any documents.

The Dallas Express recently reported that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to cite COVID-19 as a reason for reduced FOIA capacity, despite the pandemic emergency ending more than two years ago. In another case, the Air Force blew past multiple deadlines for records regarding water contamination at Dyess Air Force Base before ultimately stating that no responsive documents existed.

Hamilton said agencies are increasingly turning to automation and artificial intelligence to manage FOIA case loads, describing the tools as “force multipliers” that can speed reviews and balance workloads among analysts. But without more staff and resources, watchdogs argue, the law’s guarantees of timely public access remain out of reach.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Waiting-concept.-Human-skeleton-sitting-at-wooden-table-with-laptop-indoors-Image-by-New-AfricaShutterstock.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-31 11:56:13.928035

GRAIL (Nasdaq: GRAL) is a Menlo Park–based biotech aiming to catch cancer early with a single blood test, Galleri. This test – launched in June 2021 while GRAIL was under Illumina – is now the company’s main product and is sold by prescription to adults at higher risk, mostly those aged 50 to 75. Galleri isn’t cheap (each test runs $699 to $949), but GRAIL has bolstered its revenue through strategic partnerships, including deals with Quest Diagnostics and TRICARE, and it’s eyeing pharma collaborations to detect minimal residual disease in the future. The balance sheet’s looking squeaky clean: GRAIL holds no debt (net debt/EBITDA: 0.00 compared to a market average of 1.41) and says it has enough cash to keep the lights on through 2028, thanks to tight cost controls and a 2024 restructuring plan.

Recent Performance

Since listing, GRAIL’s stock has nearly doubled, climbing from about $17.00 to $32.79 in the year up to August 30th, 2025—a jump of roughly 93%. That’s miles ahead of the S&P 500’s 13.6% one-year return through June 30th, 2025. Investors have clearly piled in, betting big on GRAIL’s early lead in cancer screening.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

GRAIL’s top line is moving in the right direction: Q4 2024 revenue hit $38.3 million — a 26% increase year-on-year — while Q2 2025 revenue came in at $35.5 million, up 11% year-on-year, fueled by a 29% jump in U.S. Galleri test sales. Growth should keep rolling, with management aiming for mid-teens annual revenue growth through 2028. Partnerships with Quest Diagnostics and TRICARE, real-world trials like PATHFINDER 2 with the UK NHS, and a big ESMO 2025 data presentation keep GRAIL on the industry’s radar. Management is also gearing up for a crucial FDA PMA submission in the first half of 2026 and is expanding into pharma collaborations for detecting minimal residual disease, with analysts predicting $217 million in revenue by 2028.

Quality & Moat

Galleri is GRAIL’s crown jewel—a clinically validated multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test built on years of research and Illumina’s genomics know-how. The company is still running losses, and its operating margin is a deeply negative –472% (impairment-driven), but it’s making progress: non-GAAP adjusted gross profit clocked in at $16.1 million in Q2 2025, and net loss dropped a dramatic 93% year-on-year. With no net debt, a solid free cash flow ($17.0 million in Q4 2024), and a capped burn rate of $310 million for 2025, GRAIL’s runway stretches to 2028. CEO Bob Ragusa has kept a tight grip on spending, while the company’s patent portfolio and machine-learning data edge give it a defensive moat against rivals.

Valuation

GRAIL trades at an enterprise-to-sales multiple of 9.3x, far pricier than the biotech average of 4.4x. This lofty valuation reflects investors’ expectations for high growth and unique technology. Since GRAIL is still loss-making (so no P/E ratio) and doesn’t yet generate a free cash flow yield, classic valuation yardsticks don’t apply. Still, analysts see upside—a 12-month average price target of $38.33 (~17% above current levels), and Canaccord Genuity has gone even higher at $40.50, betting on clinical milestones and revenue growth. That premium price tag is underpinned by GRAIL’s first-mover advantage and fast-growing top line.

Market Sentiment

Sentiment has brightened as GRAIL clears clinical hurdles and reins in costs. The stock’s 50-day trend is down –10.9%, and volatility is high (42.9%, with a beta of 2.91). Appetite from big investors is strong: institutions own around 66.6% of shares, with Illumina and insiders holding another 14.5%, leaving a lean public float. The analyst camp mostly falls in the Moderate Buy territory (1 Buy, 2 Hold), and as upgrades have rolled in, short interest has faded. Surveyed media sentiment on competitors also tips favorably toward GRAIL, especially compared to Guardant.

Key Risks

Regulatory and Reimbursement Risk: Galleri’s future depends on FDA approval—slated for a submission in the first half of 2026—and later, on whether insurers will pay up. Regulatory setbacks or lukewarm advisory reviews could slow adoption and revenue growth.

Competition: Rivals like Exact Sciences (Cologuard), Guardant Health (Shield, Reveal), Roche, and others are vying for the same space. If competitors win broader insurance backing or show better results in the clinic, GRAIL’s market share could come under pressure.

Profitability and Cash Burn: GRAIL has plenty of cash, but it’s not profitable yet, and it’s burning through that cash pile. If it doesn’t turn the business around or keep a lid on spending, its financial runway past 2028 could shrink.

Concentrated Ownership and Volatility: With a small public float (around 20%) and high beta (2.91), GRAIL’s shares are prone to dramatic swings—something that could spook larger, more risk-averse investors and result in sharp short-term moves.

Valuation Premium: At more than 9x EV/Sales versus the market’s 4.4x average, GRAIL needs to keep delivering the goods. Any wobble in investor confidence or missed milestone could see that premium evaporate.

Bull Case

Rapid Revenue Adoption: Galleri’s sales took off, up 29% year-on-year in Q2 2025, proving there's strong demand for multi-cancer early detection.

First-Mover Advantage: GRAIL’s Galleri test was the first of its kind to hit the market, giving it a solid head start and a growing data trove to stay ahead of latecomers.

Extended Cash Runway: Restructuring and careful spending mean GRAIL has enough fuel in the tank—no cash worries through 2028, supporting more R&D and expansion.

Strategic Partnerships: Deals with Quest Diagnostics, TRICARE, the NHS’s PATHFINDER 2 trial, and pharma companies help GRAIL expand its reach and open up new revenue streams.

Analyst Upside Potential: Analysts see more to come, with an average price target of $38.33 and Canaccord Genuity going as high as $43, as clinical catalysts approach.

Bear Case

Uncertain FDA Timeline: The all-important PMA submission won’t happen until 2026—any holdups could delay growth and drag out losses.

High Valuation Relative to Peers: GRAIL’s 9.3x EV/Sales is well above the sector’s usual 4x to 5x range, so there’s no safety net if the company slips up.

Lack of Insurance Coverage: If GRAIL can’t secure broad Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance coverage, high out-of-pocket costs could keep its market size in check.

Competition Escalation: Bigger rivals like Exact Sciences and Guardant Health have more muscle on the commercial side and could secure insurance deals faster.

Execution and Scaling Risks: Expanding sales, marketing, and lab operations takes a lot of cash. If GRAIL fumbles scaling up, costs could balloon and margins could sag.

On Our Radar

ESMO 2025 Presentation: October 18–22, 2025: Watch for detailed interim results from the PATHFINDER 2 trial to be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference (ESMO 2025).

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Mid-November 2025: Q3 results and refreshed guidance, including Galleri sales progress and R&D spending updates, are due.

FDA PMA Submission: First half of 2026: The formal PMA submission for Galleri will be a pivotal regulatory moment for GRAIL’s U.S. ambitions.

Investment Conclusion

GRAIL is out in front of the multi-cancer early detection race, with strong Galleri sales and a clear set of milestones ahead. With no debt and enough cash through 2028, GRAIL has shaken off the bumps from its spin-off and is focused on scaling up its core product. But big hurdles remain—success still rests on execution, clearing regulatory hurdles, and winning over insurers. Valuation is lofty compared to the competition, which means there’s execution risk for new buyers. For investors looking to back a high-growth disruptor with a shot at changing cancer detection, GRAIL’s current price could look like an opportunity ahead of some big upcoming catalysts. However, those who need steady profits or more regulatory certainty might want to wait for further milestones to play out before jumping in.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,0.0,2025-08-30 23:56:08.958968

My dr’s office completed & submitted the PA on 8/13 and they approved it.
I was originally started on Zepbound with a diagnosis of obesity.
I also had a long standing diagnosis of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea & required a CPAP machine).
I had a sleep study done just prior to starting Zepbound and was told I had @30+ apneic episodes per hour.","46yoF, HW228, SW 221 (lost 7lbs unassisted), started 1/4/24 & current dose 15mg (Pics just for the hell of it)

Does anyone know if ppl who have TFL will be eligible for the $499/mo discounted price even though they’re on governmental insurance? (in the past Lilly has completely excluded those who’re insured with governmental insurance from any discounted prices or assistance programs) I have Blue Cross Blue Shield—husband’s employer is the State—which does not & has never covered any weight loss drugs—Medicare A/B only (on disability with No part D) and TFL (husband is retired Army —22.5yrs) and over age 65.

What’s crazy is I got the dreaded break-up letter from Tricare dated 7/30/25 saying they would no longer cover after 8/31 but because it had gotten mixed in with other pre-sorted mail-I had no clue this was a thing till I discovered the letter on 8/25. Not having seen or even knowing about this being a thing, my PA was set to expire some time in late July. My dr’s office completed & submitted the PA on 8/13 and they approved it. So, I’m so hella baffled and confused by Tricare knowing the coverage was ending on 8/31 but still yet approved the PA on 8/13…I see so many of you going to get whatever last refills you can get only discovering your PA’s have been canceled.

~God, I just hate this.~

I’ve been on Zepbound since Jan 4, 2024 and have lost @50lbs (incredibly slow but grateful loser here) and I might be able to swing $499/mo but full price @$1200+?!? Absolutely not; there’s just no frikkin way.

I was originally started on Zepbound with a diagnosis of obesity. I also had a long standing diagnosis of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea & required a CPAP machine). I had a sleep study done just prior to starting Zepbound and was told I had @30+ apneic episodes per hour. After being on Zepbound for almost a year I had another study and was found to have less than 9 apneic episodes per hour and no longer requiring a CPAP machine. In addition- I also have Multiple Sclerosis, Hyperadrenergic POTS, ME/CFS, Metabolic Dysfunction with Hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, High AF cholesterol and Diastolic Dysfunction (my heart pumps fine but cannot relax) Having a shit ton of immune deficiency conditions and conditions that affect my ability to be mobile and active; Zepbound has not just been a game changer at lowering inflammation and controlling my weight allowing me to move around with more ease & comfort…it’s given me my life back. I’m just so incredibly disappointed and frustrated with the powers at be denying me and all of you who have TFL affordability access to this medication.

FYI My next refill was due @9/3/25 but my civilian pharmacist was an absolute angel and was able to get me my last refill box early by running it on a vacation override. If you need to squeeze out your last refill box before tomorrow’s deadline & you use a civilian pharmacy-try this hack and see if they’ll come through for you too…",,N,0.0,2025-08-30 18:56:11.282025

The NCDA welcomed the news, which will see the addition of more than 480 public and fleet chargers across the province to improve access for EV drivers. But the association also cautioned that charging infrastructure alone will not deliver the federal government and B.C.’s ambitious zero-emission vehicle targets “without action on affordability and policy timelines.”

“This investment is good news, but it won’t matter if British Columbians can’t afford the vehicles,” said Blair Qualey, President and CEO of the NCDA, in a statement. “The federal and provincial governments must re-establish EV rebate programs and put the brakes on unrealistic ZEV mandates. Without immediate action, these targets will remain out of reach — and consumers will be left behind.”

The NCDA said rebates are necessary. The ones under the CleanBC Go Electric program are currently on pause and pending review. And at the federal level, iZEV support is also under review. The association said the programs have been critical to making EVs more affordable for consumers and helping with uptake.

They also cautioned that mandates need a reality check, as the federal government’s national mandate/targets are not achievable due to the incentive situation, market readiness, and conditions that no longer exist. Rather, the association is advocating for a three-pillar approach to EV adoption: affordability through incentives, infrastructure, and education to build consumer confidence.

“All three must work together,” said Qualey. “Government cannot remove one leg of the stool and expect the system to stay upright. We are urging both levels of government to restore incentives and revisit ZEV policies before British Columbians are priced out of the market.”",https://tricorauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-tricor-favicon-O-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-08-30 15:56:10.214634

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard.
Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.
“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate.
So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.” As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?","Jennifer Barnhill is a columnist for Military.com writing about military families.

Despite making headlines for helping after the catastrophic flooding in Texas or being politicized as President Donald Trump deploys it to police U.S. cities, the National Guard remains a mystery to both civilians and the active-duty force. However, as our nation increasingly calls upon the Guard, we need to better understand our “always ready” force, or it may not be ready when we need it.

“I was going to pick up a prescription that I needed, and they were like, ‘Your insurance isn't working’. And I was like, ‘What do you mean it's not working? It's Tricare,” said Emily Schmidt, whose spouse flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Maryland National Guard. They started by calling Tricare, who directed them to the personnel database, the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, where staff told them they couldn’t help because his unit hadn't processed his orders properly.

Schmidt’s family was dropped from Tricare insurance because his new orders hadn’t been added to the system correctly, a particularly onerous issue for Guardsmen because their status and orders change regularly, causing them to have to pay out of pocket for medications during these transitions.

Despite representing 21% of the Defense Department’s total military force and more than 34% of the Army as of 2023, the challenges faced by those in the Guard are less visible, and often complicated. Unlike active-duty troops, who receive all their orders from the federal government, National Guard orders typically come directly from the governor of the state where they are assigned. Guardsmen get to “homestead,” but if they live far from their assigned state, they may find themselves away from available resources. They also have to balance the demands of working for a civilian employer, the state and the federal government when called upon to serve under federal orders.

There are three main types of National Guard duty statuses:

Title 10 – Federal control and funding, used for overseas deployments, combat operations, or other federal missions; eligible for full federal benefits and subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Title 32 – State control but federally funded; covers drills, annual training, homeland defense missions, and full-time Guard roles; federal benefits apply.

State Active Duty – State control and funding; used for state missions like disaster relief; state benefits only, not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.

The complex set of statuses gets further complicated by the irregular nature of Guard funding.

“They'll say, ‘We're going to hire you for a year, but your orders are not cut for the year because of the way money is dispersed,” said Lainey Crown, National Guard spouse and mental health clinician/licensed professional clinical counselor. “Every time you get put on these new orders, somebody has to go in and push a button to say that you're eligible for Tricare. But that does not always happen.”

The Crown family had a six-day lapse in coverage, during which time one of their kids needed to have surgery. A few months later, they received a $20,000 bill. While the error was eventually corrected, it was not easy to identify who was the right person to fix the problem.

“There have been times if Patrick were to be in a car accident and killed today, and I would have to notify his unit, I don't know who to call,” said Crown, referring to her husband.

Because families can live anywhere, Crown has lived in North Carolina, Georgia and now Kentucky, while her spouse worked for the Maryland and now Alabama Army National Guard units. As a result, Crown has found herself far from available resources and, because they didn’t live near their unit, she did not know who to call for help when paperwork was not processed properly.

“The problem with it stopping and starting again is usually – and I'd say at least half the time – there's an error,” said Hope Daupert, who was named the 2025 AFI National Guard Spouse of the Year for her work educating Guardsmen about accessing life insurance, another area where lapses can occur due to changing statuses. “I think at this point, everybody's just so used to it. Nobody really complains about it anymore.”

Those potential lapses may have an impact on military readiness, according to advocates.

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard. “The more that we use the National Guard, the more we're going to have to think about these benefits.”

NGAUS is one of the organizations that has aggressively advocated for military families. It has supported the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that would give Guardsmen and reservists “premium-free/zero cost sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for Tricare Reserve Select (TRS).” The legislation would also allow Guardsmen to purchase care for family members, reducing gaps in coverage.

“When service members sign up to serve their country, it’s our duty to support them. That includes providing access to comprehensive health care,” said one of the bill’s co-sponsors, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in an email to Military.com. “Extending Tricare to all service members not only does right by our troops and their families, it also is a common-sense investment in our military readiness.”

The legislation would do more than minimize gaps in coverage: It seeks to improve readiness.

According to NGAUS, an estimated 130,000 Guardsmen and reservists are currently without health care.

“A lot of times, they wait to go on orders so that they can fix any health issues free of charge,” said Plamann. When deployment notices are as short as 24 hours, these Guardsmen aren’t physically prepared to deploy. “Our medical readiness numbers for our units are very low.”

Plamann said that some version of this legislation has been proposed annually for the past 10 years, but has not seen progress in Congress. Plamann believes there is hesitation due to the costs involved. “To give National Guard and reserve health care coverage annually would cost about $700 million,” she said. This would amount to roughly .07 percent of the proposed $925 billion military budget. ""For how much the nation relies upon the Guard, that's worth it.”

But cost may not be the only obstacle. Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.

At the same time, Guardsmen and their families are more and more in the political crosshairs.

The National Guard has been increasingly called upon by Trump, sometimes in more common natural disaster response roles, as in their activation after the recent floods in Texas, but also for what are seen as politically motivated reasons, like being mobilized to Los Angeles following protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the more recent mobilization to Washington, D.C.

“People are so emotional about it that they don't see the person or the families behind it,” said Schmidt. “The service member might not agree with the things that are happening, but they still have a duty. … They still have a responsibility [to follow orders].”

If they are in the crosshairs nationally, Guardsmen are seen differently locally.

“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate. “We're able to have our homes in the places that we've grown up. … I live a block away from my parents.” This sense of community isn’t just felt by the families; Guardsmen experience it too.

Deady recalls when her husband’s Guard unit came to the aid of their local community after tornadoes demolished buildings and homes in their Ohio town. “Within two hours of confirmation, our guys were on site, with our heavy equipment, with everything. So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.”

As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?

Instead of accepting system failure as the status quo and blaming Guardsmen for the actions of politicians, we should be asking how we can improve National Guard quality of life, just as we did for active-duty families.

In March 2024, an initiative called “My Military Health” was launched at five venture sites around the nation.
This is the agency’s fourth Joint Meritorious Unit Award in its nearly 12-year history.","Beginning with the Continental Congress authorizing the establishment of a hospital for its army of 20,000 soldiers in 1775, the United States has provided health care to its active military members for hundreds of years.

Among the developments before the 20th Century:

July 1776 - Continental Army Medical Department is established

Aug. 1842 - Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery is established

May 1862 - Army Medical Museum is established to serve as a center for the collection of specimens for research in military medicine and surgery.

In 1951, DOD strengthened the Office of Medical Services and renamed it the Armed Forces Medical Policy Council. The new agency provided coordination of medical policy within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, DOD, other government agencies, and civilian medical and allied health organizations, agencies, and professions.

The Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team was established during the Vietnam War. The team included medical and weapons experts who collected data on wounds and injuries sustained by service members during the war. The team's findings were used to improve the design and effectiveness of military weapons and protective gear.

Congress passed the Military Medical Benefits Amendments. Collectively, these acts founded the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, known as CHAMPUS. CHAMPUS established a way for DOD to contract with civilian facilities so beneficiaries could receive non-hospital-based services through civilian health care plans.

The Composite Health Care System was the DOD's first health record system to go paperless with electronic order entry. CHCS is also the basis of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application, which focused on delivering a military treatment facility-centric electronic health record that supported computerized physician order entry and integrated outpatient ancillary services.

Many people first heard about telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, but did you know telehealth has been around for more than 30 years? In the 1990s, the medical field was exploring how telehealth and telemedicine could enhance medical operational support. This was most notable in 1993, when the U.S. Army first used video-enabled care in Somalia. This care quickly expanded in 1994 and 1995 during operations in the Balkans.

The Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs successfully collaborated to form the Defense and Veterans Head Injury Program which was later named the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. The program tracked service members' head and neck injuries, ensured they received the right treatment, studied the treatment outcome, and counseled family members regarding the service members' injuries.

The Gulf War Health Center at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was established to care for Gulf War veterans with war-related physical and mental health challenges. In 1999, it became the Deployment Health Clinical Center—one of three DOD centers of excellence for deployment health—along with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center and the Naval Health Research Center.

Founded on Oct. 31, 1997, the Air Force Research Laboratory leads the discovery, development, and delivery of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyber forces. One of the centers is the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, an internationally renowned center for aerospace medical learning, consultation, aerospace medical investigations, and aircrew health assessments. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory trains approximately 6,000 students each year.

The end of the Gulf War resulted in the recognition that an electronic health record was needed. President Bill Clinton directed establishment of a new Force Health Protection program. Under his plan, every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine would have a comprehensive, lifelong medical record.

Defense Secretary William Cohen started reforms to separate elements of the DOD Health Affairs agency's operations and from policy making. Health Affairs policy makers remained housed in the Pentagon, while TRICARE operations and support relocated to Washington, D.C., and Aurora, Colorado. The TRICARE Support Office's priorities included force medical protection, Medicare subvention, which provided alternatives for delivering accessible and quality care to certain veterans, and preventive medicine and wellness issues.

DHAPP was established in 2001 to help contain the global health threat posed by the HIV pandemic. DHAPP’s mission was, and still is, to assist foreign militaries in developing HIV control programs in support of global health security and DOD security cooperation efforts.

In 2004, the military medical departments were directed to establish a single trauma registry in order to collect and aggregate combat casualty care epidemiology, treatments, and outcomes. This knowledge was essential to understanding the challenges, successes, and failures the military medical corps faced in providing effective and timely care for combat casualties. The Joint Trauma System was established as the agency to build and manage the Joint Trauma Registry.

On March 11, 2013, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum outlining the implementation of MHS governance reform as it was outlined in section 731 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. While the centerpiece for this reform was the establishment of the DHA as a Combat Support Agency, the memo also established multi-service market areas as geographic areas where at least two military medical hospitals or clinics from different military service branches had overlapping service areas.

On Oct. 1, 2013, DOD established the DHA as a one of eight Combat Support Agencies supporting joint operating forces and Combatant Commands engaged in military operations and to direct the execution of 10 joint shared services: the TRICARE health program; pharmacy operations; health information technology; medical logistics; facility management; research and development; education and training; public health; budget and resource management; and contracting. The TRICARE Management Activity was decommissioned with the establishment of the DHA.

On July 9, 2014, DHA assumed operational management and support of the ASBP and DHAPP. Each program brought a unique combat support capability to the DHA. The ASBP is the official provider of blood products for the U.S. Armed Forces. The DHAPP executes worldwide HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs.

On Aug. 23, 2015, the National Museum of Health and Medicine joined DHA. The museum spans five collections consisting of about 25 million artifacts, including the bullet that killed President Abraham Lincoln, 5,000 skeletal specimens, 8,000 preserved organs, 12,000 items of medical equipment, an archive of historic medical documents, and more.

The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System has a history dating back to the 1950s and early 1960s, which evolved by the expansion of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology's field of study that included a forensic pathology registry in 1958. In 1959, the Military Environmental Pathology Division was established, consisting of forensic pathology, aviation medicine, and toxicology. In 1962, the first forensic pathology fellowship in the United States was established. AFMES was formally transferred from MRMC to the DHA on Aug. 31, 2015.

The Defense Department awarded the contract to build the Department's electronic health record, later branded as MHS GENESIS. The deployment of MHS GENESIS began in the Pacific Northwest in 2015 followed by 25 unique waves encompassing military hospitals and clinics in the U.S.. In September 2023, MHS GENESIS began to deploy to military hospitals and clinics in the European and Indo-Pacific regions.

In fall of 2016, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness recommended the DOD ""establish the JTS, in its role as the DOD Trauma System as the lead agency for trauma in DOD with authority to establish and assure best-practice trauma care guidelines to the DHA Director, the Services, and the Combatant Commanders.

On Dec. 11, 2016, the Hearing Center of Excellence became a part of DHA. The Center focuses on the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of hearing loss and auditory injury. It also partners with the VA, institutions of higher education, and other mission-minded public and private organizations to advance research and care in hearing loss.

In 2016, the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury and its centers transitioned to DHA. The Deployment Health Clinical Center officially changed its name to the Psychological Health Center of Excellence to better align with its current mission. The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center retained its enduring mission of evaluating, integrating, and promoting TBI practices and policies across the services.

Section 702 of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act and subsequent guidance provided by Congress in 2018, 2019, and 2020 directed the Military Health System to reorganize, redefining the roles of the military departments and DHA in the administration and management of military hospitals and clinics.

In March 2018, the Vision Center of Excellence joined the DHA family to address the full scope of vision care in the armed forces, including prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, research, and rehabilitation of military eye injuries and diseases in order to improve vision health, optimize readiness, and enhance quality of life for service members and veterans.

On Jan. 30, 2020, medical facilities were organized into four regions within the United States. These “markets” included hospitals and clinics in the National Capital Region (Washington, D.C., southern Maryland, and northern Virginia), along with Jacksonville, Florida, the Mississippi coast (Biloxi, Gulfport, and Pascagoula), and Central North Carolina (Fayetteville). Following a brief pause during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tidewater became the 5th market to be established on April 19, 2021.

In October 2022, the Army, Navy/Marine Corps, and Air Force moved public health centers and programs to the DHA. The newly established DHA Public Health enterprise supports the Joint Force and the DOD across the globe by combining and integrating the efforts of the service components to enable a healthy ready force that includes our military families and other beneficiaries.

In March 2024, an initiative called “My Military Health” was launched at five venture sites around the nation. The tools were designed offer care that was individualized, accessible, and convenient. My Military Health will be accessible 24/7 by computer and mobile devices, will allow patients to schedule appointments, engage with automated clinical support for medical conditions, and use self-help wellness programs.

The Dec. 2024 launch of www.dha.mil provided the Agency with a standalone platform to share developments and news with stakeholders, provide information for vendors to more easily do business with the Agency, give beneficiaries easily navigable pathways to their own care, and establish an employee hub to highlight the benefits and opportunities available in working for the DHA.

The Defense Health Agency distinguished itself by exceptionally meritorious achievement from Nov. 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. During this period, the president of the United States and secretary of defense appointed the DHA to develop and execute a vaccination plan to protect 11.3 million eligible personnel worldwide. The first DOD Coronavirus-2019 Vaccine Distribution Plan addressed acquisition, distribution, resourcing, training, administration, reporting, and communications. This is the agency’s fourth Joint Meritorious Unit Award in its nearly 12-year history.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/History-Timeline/1775-US-Army-Medical-ServiceCorps.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-30 09:56:11.268665

Prosecutors say Adelle Starin operated the store, selling baby products and toys. The 41-year-old Sartell woman submitted false claims for reimbursement to the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program, TRICARE, which initially paid out the claims. When TRICARE began rejecting her claims, Starin created a fictitious company called Sunshine Medical LLC. She falsely represented to two lenders, Liquid Capital Enterprises Corp. and Slope Tech Inc., saying she needed financing to buy supplies for her store from a place called Sunshine Medical, which was a shell company. To collect the cash, Starin created fake invoices from Sunshine Medical and sent them via interstate wire transfers.

In December, Starin pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of wire fraud. In addition to the prison sentence, she must also serve three years of supervised release and pay $2.35 million in restitution.

Hello and welcome to Health Affairs This Week. I'm your host, Jeff Beyers. We're recording on 08/25/2025. Just as a reminder, we are releasing a new theme issue next week on the opioid crisis. On September 3, we have a free issue briefing on the issue.

Jeff Byers: 01:04

On September 17, we have a lunch and learn on the current opioids policy landscape and what's ahead. Hope you'll join us for that and check out the issue. Today on the pod to talk about, pharmacy benefit managers and, laws around it, we have Andrew Twinemasyko, from the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Andrew, welcome back to the program.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 01:25

Oh, thank you, Jeff. It's always a pleasure talking to you.

Jeff Byers: 01:29

So there've been a lot of PBM cases going on lately. What case are we discussing today and how might it differ from the others?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 01:35

Well, so today we are here to talk about the riveting case of Express Scripts versus Richmond, a case challenging Arkansas's recently enacted law prohibiting PBMs from owning operating pharmacies in Arkansas. As of today, the case has actually now gone to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals because the Arkansas District Court ruled against Arkansas and enjoined the law. And the statute in question in this case is the first to take this step that prohibits PBMs from owning operating pharmacies within a state.

Jeff Byers: 02:11

So what is the Arkansas PBM law? What does it actually do? Why was this law made in the first place?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 02:19

Okay. So let's contextualize it like, so we all know that the price of prescription drugs in The United States is way higher than that in other peer economies. Drug prices in The United States triple the prices of comparable countries with US consumers paying almost $3 for every dollar spent by consumers in other countries. And of course The US drug market has very many stakeholders. We have manufacturers, distributors, insurers, pharmacies, PBMs and many others.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 02:50

And each of these players have a role in driving up the price of prescription drugs. There's been a lot of talk over the last few years about the unique role that pharmacy benefit managers have played in driving up the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs. And I don't want to sound like it's solely PBMs responsible for this. What I'm saying is that they are part of this system. And today there are three PBMs, namely CVS's Caremark, Cigna's Express Scripts and UnitedHealth's Optum, which by the way the FTC has referred to as the big three.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 03:28

Maybe soon one of these big three will come out like Kendrick Lamar and say like, oh no, it's not the big three, it's big me. I don't know, but I digress. Anyway, the big three control 80% of the market. And more importantly here is that PBMs are part of vertically integrated organizations. They have relationships with insurers, with providers, with pharmacies, and actually have stakes in those establishments, which contributes to the opaqueness of the operations and how those relationships contribute to driving up prices.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 04:05

So for example, CVS owns CVS pharmacies, Caremark, a PBM and Aetna, an insurer. And so this is included in reports by FTC, The US House Committee On Oversight And Government and how they engage in anti competitive behaviors. So anyway, to address the anti competitive behaviors that the PBMs engage in, there've been a wide range of laws that are passed. But the Arkansas law that was passed this week takes a new approach. It prohibits PBMs from operating pharmacies and Arkansas is not actually not an outlier.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 04:42

There are other statutes of the sort that have been introduced in New York and in Texas and in Vermont. And so Arkansas takes that approach of trying to rein in their vertical integration of PBMs.

Jeff Byers: 04:56

Why are we hearing more about the Arkansas law then versus, you know, the New York or the?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 05:02

Oh, the the New York, they have just been introduced, but Arkansas, they're still they haven't been passed, enacted so to speak. Okay. Arkansas just it was is the one that was the first one to pass this law and enact it. Other ones have just been introduced.

Jeff Byers: 05:16

So what is the current status of Express Scripts versus Richmond?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 05:20

So there were actually four lawsuits that were filed, Express Scripts, CVS Pharmacy, Optum and the trade group that represents PBMs, PCMA, and they're all consolidated in one case. And they brought a wide range of challenges, mainly saying that the law violates the so called dormant commerce clause. And it's also preempted by several federal laws. It violates the equal protection clause, it violates the bill of attainder. And so like a wide range of cause of action and the court sided with the challenges on two grounds.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 05:58

One, found that the law likely violates the Dohman Commerce Clause and is likely preempted by TRICARE, and thereby, the court issued its order enjoining the the stat the the law on those two grounds.

Jeff Byers: 06:11

Okay. So I'm not a lawyer. Chris Fleming's not on the call. What what does that mean? Like, when are you talking about the grounds and TRICARE and the dormant commerce clause?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 06:23

Yeah. And this actually might seem like arcane principles, but so let me break them down bit by bit. I'll start with the commerce clause. So the US constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states. In other words, it's only Congress that may regulate interstate commerce.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 06:43

And the Supreme Court has interpreted this affirmative grant of authority to Congress as also implicitly having a negative aspect. In other words, Congress has power that lies dormant even when it's not exercised and that power prohibits States from undertaking certain actions that might interfere with the national economy. So when you hear constitution lawyers talking about the so called dormant commerce clause, that's the part they're referring to. And so this, the dormant commerce clause is actually mainly aimed at guarding against economic protectionist laws. So when states engage in discriminatory behavior favoring in state business and disfavoring out of state businesses, that type of discrimination is impermissible under the dormant commerce clause.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 07:27

And there is another way through which states can violate the so called dormant commerce clause by imposing what is called an undue burden on interstate commerce. So if a state enacts a law that really it's kind of a balance what courts look at, they could have a balance like if the burdens that the state imposes on interstate commerce far outweigh the local benefits, then that law has to be validated. And so the court here said that the Arkansas law one, actually expressly and overtly discriminates against interstate commerce because it was passed with a protectionist intent to protect local pharmacies and local independent pharmacies. Then the court straight up said, you say this in the statute that you enacted this statute to protect local businesses and harm out of state businesses. So the court found that was impermissible.

Jeff Byers: 08:27

So is what you're saying the potential for the Arkansas PBM law kind of enacts that dormant commerce clause to like wake up essentially?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 08:36

Yeah. So the Arkansas PBM law violates the dormant commerce clause. The PBMs said that by enacting this law, you are intruding in a space that involves Congress's power and you are discriminating against interstate commerce favoring in state businesses. So yes, that triggers the dohment commerce clause and thereby invalidate it.

Jeff Byers: 09:04

So that's the big three's argument against the state law. Okay. So that's ground number one.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 09:11

Yeah. So the interesting thing is that the court found so a state law can violate the Dormant Commerce Clause in two ways. One, by discriminating and two, by unduly burdening interstate commerce. So the court found on both fronts, the Arkansas law likely violates the Dormant Commerce Clause. So the court said, even if you didn't discriminate against interstate commerce, there is another way you could have gone about achieving the goals of this legislation without necessarily prohibiting PBMs from owning and operating pharmacies in Arkansas.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 09:45

You could have, you already have actually, cannabis has three laws that already prohibit these conflicts of interests in a way. And the court said, you are really putting a huge burden on a national market to achieve specific state benefits that you have already achieved otherwise.

Jeff Byers: 10:03

So they're just saying, like, come on, buddy?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 10:06

Well, yeah. I mean, yeah. Like, basically, I think the idea is that you have to show that there are huge benefits that this law brings that outweigh the burdens that you're putting on your own national operators.

Jeff Byers: 10:19

So that's commerce clause, anything we wanna talk touch on with TRICARE, Prun?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 10:23

Yeah. So this, and I think, actually talking about the Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption, they really all involve the same concerns about the power of the federal government. So there is this pesky thing called the supremacy clause and I'm being facetious there. But basically it's how the hierarchy of laws between federal and state laws. The supremacy clause dictates that federal law takes precedence over state law.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 10:55

When the two conflict, state law has to give way. And there are different ways through which a state law can be preempted. Congress can come and straight up say like, Hey, states, you can't do this. Hammer time, you can't touch this.

Jeff Byers: 11:08

So,

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 11:12

the court said, and also, so one is express, you can expressly preempt a state law or impliedly preempted. If the court finds that, for example, a state law stands as an obstacle in accomplishing federal objectives, then the state law has to give way in that context. So here, there is language in the TRICARE program, which is the program that provides through which the military gets its healthcare that says it preempts state laws that concern the delivery of healthcare. And because Tricare contracts with PBMs in delivering healthcare, the court found that this law expressly preempts that aspect.

Jeff Byers: 11:54

So this is a preliminary injunction, if I'm understanding it, what might this mean for the future of the case?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 12:02

Well, so preliminary injunction means that the law Akela can't enforce the law for now. But before the court, and issuing a preliminary injunction is actually a big deal. A court just it's considered an extraordinary remedy, so you really have to convince the court on different fronts. One is that you are likely to win when the case is fully litigated and not only are you likely to win but also there isn't any other remedy available through which you can be compensated should you win. So like to really stop a duly enacted law of the state, the court has to weigh a lot of things.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 12:41

So what this means is that because the court has already projected that Arkansas is likely to win on these two fronts, this slot will likely not be enforced for the near future until the case goes all the way through the litigation process.

Jeff Byers: 12:56

Okay. So but they are kind of signaling that there is good chance that the law could eventually get on the books.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 13:07

What the court is saying is that Arkansas is likely to lose when it all it's all said and done, at least likely to lose on those two grounds, Dohman Thomas Clause and TRICARE preemption.

Jeff Byers: 13:17

So what does this mean for other states looking into this particular idea? What does it mean for the pharmaceutical industry in general?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 13:27

Well, I mean, least for other states, and I think, well, one thing is that Arkansas district court is a district court. It has jurisdiction within only Arkansas, and other courts aren't bound by that decision. So meaning, let's say Texas or Vermont or New York passed that law, those states can take their chances if those laws are challenged, states can take their chances before those courts. And it remains to be seen if they'll be persuaded by the reasoning that the judge in the Arkansas case did. But also one thing to notice is that there are specifics in this case.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 14:10

For example, the judge in the Arkansas case looked at the legislative history of this case, of this statute, and how the statute was designed. And so those specifics in various aspects tanked this case before this judge. Other states might take a different approach that might not necessarily be similar in those specifics with other in their legislation. So states can go ahead and do that. Of course, like as I said, until the Supreme Court says that this is how it is, we're going to have different legislation go through the states and see what really the status of the law is.

Jeff Byers: 14:59

Final question is, are there particular healthcare law cases that you're keeping track of that you just would like the listeners to know about or that you find interesting?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 15:07

Yeah, I mentioned litigation over the Medicare drug negotiation program and sphing of states taking action. There are different states enacting laws curbing prescription drug prices. One particular litigation that we're watching is litigation over Colorado's Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Amgen sued Colorado claiming different, that it violates different constitutional guarantees and so that litigation is also going on. So we're keeping an eye on different litigation both at the federal and state levels challenging what this government can do to keep the price of prescription drugs down.

Jeff Byers: 15:53

,,2025-08-29 15:53:47+00:00,Military.com,Why No One Understands National Guard Families | Military.com,"Jennifer Barnhill, Jennifer Barnhill Published",,,,,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/08/29/why-no-one-understands-national-guard-families.html,"It's Tricare,” said Emily Schmidt, whose spouse flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Maryland National Guard.
“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard.
Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.
“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate.
So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.” As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?","Jennifer Barnhill is a columnist for Military.com writing about military families.

Despite making headlines for helping after the catastrophic flooding in Texas or being politicized as President Donald Trump deploys it to police U.S. cities, the National Guard remains a mystery to both civilians and the active-duty force. However, as our nation increasingly calls upon the Guard, we need to better understand our “always ready” force, or it may not be ready when we need it.

“I was going to pick up a prescription that I needed, and they were like, ‘Your insurance isn't working’. And I was like, ‘What do you mean it's not working? It's Tricare,” said Emily Schmidt, whose spouse flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Maryland National Guard. They started by calling Tricare, who directed them to the personnel database, the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, where staff told them they couldn’t help because his unit hadn't processed his orders properly.

Schmidt’s family was dropped from Tricare insurance because his new orders hadn’t been added to the system correctly, a particularly onerous issue for Guardsmen because their status and orders change regularly, causing them to have to pay out of pocket for medications during these transitions.

Despite representing 21% of the Defense Department’s total military force and more than 34% of the Army as of 2023, the challenges faced by those in the Guard are less visible, and often complicated. Unlike active-duty troops, who receive all their orders from the federal government, National Guard orders typically come directly from the governor of the state where they are assigned. Guardsmen get to “homestead,” but if they live far from their assigned state, they may find themselves away from available resources. They also have to balance the demands of working for a civilian employer, the state and the federal government when called upon to serve under federal orders.

There are three main types of National Guard duty statuses:

Title 10 – Federal control and funding, used for overseas deployments, combat operations, or other federal missions; eligible for full federal benefits and subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Title 32 – State control but federally funded; covers drills, annual training, homeland defense missions, and full-time Guard roles; federal benefits apply.

State Active Duty – State control and funding; used for state missions like disaster relief; state benefits only, not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.

The complex set of statuses gets further complicated by the irregular nature of Guard funding.

“They'll say, ‘We're going to hire you for a year, but your orders are not cut for the year because of the way money is dispersed,” said Lainey Crown, National Guard spouse and mental health clinician/licensed professional clinical counselor. “Every time you get put on these new orders, somebody has to go in and push a button to say that you're eligible for Tricare. But that does not always happen.”

The Crown family had a six-day lapse in coverage, during which time one of their kids needed to have surgery. A few months later, they received a $20,000 bill. While the error was eventually corrected, it was not easy to identify who was the right person to fix the problem.

“There have been times if Patrick were to be in a car accident and killed today, and I would have to notify his unit, I don't know who to call,” said Crown, referring to her husband.

Because families can live anywhere, Crown has lived in North Carolina, Georgia and now Kentucky, while her spouse worked for the Maryland and now Alabama Army National Guard units. As a result, Crown has found herself far from available resources and, because they didn’t live near their unit, she did not know who to call for help when paperwork was not processed properly.

“The problem with it stopping and starting again is usually – and I'd say at least half the time – there's an error,” said Hope Daupert, who was named the 2025 AFI National Guard Spouse of the Year for her work educating Guardsmen about accessing life insurance, another area where lapses can occur due to changing statuses. “I think at this point, everybody's just so used to it. Nobody really complains about it anymore.”

Those potential lapses may have an impact on military readiness, according to advocates.

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard. “The more that we use the National Guard, the more we're going to have to think about these benefits.”

NGAUS is one of the organizations that has aggressively advocated for military families. It has supported the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that would give Guardsmen and reservists “premium-free/zero cost sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for Tricare Reserve Select (TRS).” The legislation would also allow Guardsmen to purchase care for family members, reducing gaps in coverage.

“When service members sign up to serve their country, it’s our duty to support them. That includes providing access to comprehensive health care,” said one of the bill’s co-sponsors, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in an email to Military.com. “Extending Tricare to all service members not only does right by our troops and their families, it also is a common-sense investment in our military readiness.”

The legislation would do more than minimize gaps in coverage: It seeks to improve readiness.

According to NGAUS, an estimated 130,000 Guardsmen and reservists are currently without health care.

“A lot of times, they wait to go on orders so that they can fix any health issues free of charge,” said Plamann. When deployment notices are as short as 24 hours, these Guardsmen aren’t physically prepared to deploy. “Our medical readiness numbers for our units are very low.”

Plamann said that some version of this legislation has been proposed annually for the past 10 years, but has not seen progress in Congress. Plamann believes there is hesitation due to the costs involved. “To give National Guard and reserve health care coverage annually would cost about $700 million,” she said. This would amount to roughly .07 percent of the proposed $925 billion military budget. ""For how much the nation relies upon the Guard, that's worth it.”

But cost may not be the only obstacle. Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.

At the same time, Guardsmen and their families are more and more in the political crosshairs.

The National Guard has been increasingly called upon by Trump, sometimes in more common natural disaster response roles, as in their activation after the recent floods in Texas, but also for what are seen as politically motivated reasons, like being mobilized to Los Angeles following protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the more recent mobilization to Washington, D.C.

“People are so emotional about it that they don't see the person or the families behind it,” said Schmidt. “The service member might not agree with the things that are happening, but they still have a duty. … They still have a responsibility [to follow orders].”

If they are in the crosshairs nationally, Guardsmen are seen differently locally.

“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate. “We're able to have our homes in the places that we've grown up. … I live a block away from my parents.” This sense of community isn’t just felt by the families; Guardsmen experience it too.

Deady recalls when her husband’s Guard unit came to the aid of their local community after tornadoes demolished buildings and homes in their Ohio town. “Within two hours of confirmation, our guys were on site, with our heavy equipment, with everything. So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.”

As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?

Instead of accepting system failure as the status quo and blaming Guardsmen for the actions of politicians, we should be asking how we can improve National Guard quality of life, just as we did for active-duty families. We are all part of the military.

""For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.
Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.
That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.
""We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,"" he said.","The following information was released by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS):

Introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the Healthcare for Our Troops Act (S. 2575) would offer premium-free, zero-cost-share medical coverage to every member of the Guard and Reserve through TRICARE, the military's health insurance program.

About 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists currently have no medical coverage. Hundreds of thousands more pay for their own coverage or rely on employer-provided health insurance.

Baldwin spoke at the 147th General Conference and Exhibition on Saturday in Milwaukee, where she received the NGAUS Harry S. Truman Award, the association's highest honor.

""We've fallen short in a pretty crucial area and that is basic health care,"" she told attendees. ""I believe that's morally wrong. It's bad for preparedness and readiness. And yes, we need to change it.""

""Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access,"" said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president. ""For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.

""Our Guardsmen need this, and our nation needs them,"" he added. ""I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.""

Current law provides coverage to part-time Guardsmen and Reservists only when they are federally mobilized on orders for more than 30 days. Most of the Guard's domestic missions are of a shorter duration. Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.

In addition, Guardsmen must also be medically ready to respond to the state or nation with little to no notice. This can be challenging for the almost one in five who have no private coverage and lack access to routine, preventive health care, McGinn added.

Zero-cost TRICARE is a top NGAUS legislative priority.

Both the House and Senate have considered legislation to expand medical coverage to part-time service members in recent years. Major legislation such as this often requires several years to win congressional approval.

S. 2575 would enroll Guardsmen and Reservists into TRICARE Reserve Select at no cost.

TRS is currently a partially subsidized program for drilling Guardsmen and Reservists. They cover a monthly premium and co-pays for services. The legislation would eliminate all those costs.

That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.

""We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,"" he said. ""We need to view Guard Soldiers and Airmen in the same light.""",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-29 12:56:19.349779

Knowing the operations status of Andrews before, during and after a storm is crucial for safety and mission readiness. The base communicates updates in several ways, and all personnel, families and mission partners are encouraged to stay connected through official channels, such as the base website (www.jba.af.mil) and the JBA Connect App. People are also encouraged to subscribe to emergency alerts from the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center.

Hurricane Erin became the first major hurricane of the season when it formed Aug. 11, 2025, and while it didn’t make landfall, it did have minor impacts as it traveled north along the East Coast. The hurricane reached a peak of Category 5 on Aug. 16 before weakening to Category 1 on Aug. 22 as it went past the coast of North Carolina.

When hurricanes are forecast to impact the area, base personnel should monitor weather updates closely and be ready to act. This may include securing outdoor property, adjusting travel plans, or preparing for shelter-in-place orders. If ordered to evacuate, follow instructions from local authorities and leadership promptly.

During an emergency, people may to need to survive rely on their own supplies for several days, and a kit with food, water and other supplies with basic household items would be ideal. According to ready.gov, a basic kit includes:

Water

Food

Battery-powered or hand-crank radio and a NOAA weather radio with tone alert

Flashlight

First aid kit

Extra batteries

Whistle (to signal for help)

Dust mask (to filter contaminated air)

Plastic sheeting, scissors and duct tape (to shelter in place)

Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)

Wrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)

Manual can opener

Local maps

Cell phone with chargers and backup battery

Consider keeping smaller, portable kits in your vehicle and workplace in case you are away from home when an emergency occurs. Review and refresh your go kit every six months to ensure supplies are current and functional.

Personal preparedness reduces the strain on emergency responders and ensures that you and your family can weather disruptions safely. By assembling a go kit and staying connected to official Andrews information channels, you will be better prepared to respond quickly and effectively when storms approach.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9182400/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-29 14:56:20.644886
