No, TRICARE typically doesn’t qualify for a Health Savings Account or HSA due to its lower deductibles. However, certain TRICARE beneficiaries (TRICARE for Life or TRICARE Reserve Select) may be eligible for HSAs due to their high-deductible health plan.

TRICARE and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)

TRICARE can be used alongside a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). TRICARE does not directly offer an FSA, but beneficiaries can still contribute to an FSA through their employer if offered.

There are two FSAs offered:

The Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA)

The Health Care FSA (HCFSA)

These FSAs can help cover eligible dependent care and healthcare expenses like TRICARE deductibles, copayments, and other non-covered services, making it a useful tool for managing medical costs.

To achieve this end, mission-driven healthcare agencies can prioritize seamless, secure electronic access to enrollment, care, health records, educational health information and materials, and more.","This article appeared on GovernmentTechnologyInsider. View the original article here.

While the federal healthcare ecosystem undergoes transformation, the ability for service personnel to access care through the Defense Health Agency (DHA) remains essential to supporting a mission-ready force. It is also important for Veterans to receive high quality care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As we think of personalized care and modernization, these two organizations will need to partner for the best possible care as they serve a combined 18.5M+ beneficiaries.

Today, many beneficiaries expect digital, personalized experiences when accessing care and benefit services. Providing this tailored, omni-channel service is a monumental task. However, a digital approach to health services powered by advanced technologies and human-centered design can create a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience (CX). This includes access to care and information with centralized user portals, as well as portability of healthcare data between agencies. These health services can then keep pace with the military community’s healthcare needs and ensures our nation can respond rapidly to evolving mission readiness priorities.

Reimagining CX to deliver preventive healthcare – anytime, anywhere

Today, it’s well understood that healthcare doesn’t just need to happen when a beneficiary is unwell and requires care. Healthcare must be preventive to improve health outcomes, lower costs to health systems, and decrease risks to mission readiness. Consider that Military Health System (MHS) medical encounters increased by 18 percent between 2022 and 2023 alone, increasing costs to MHS and underscoring the need for prevention to keep beneficiaries healthy and ready to serve. It is clear that military health agencies need a path forward to efficiently deliver preventive care.

To achieve this end, mission-driven healthcare agencies can prioritize seamless, secure electronic access to enrollment, care, health records, educational health information and materials, and more. Doing so will mark a significant improvement over traditional government services and paper forms that are difficult to track and manage and often lead to inefficient, fragmented care.

For example, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) has launched several initiatives to provide a secure digital entry for beneficiaries by consolidating and standardizing solutions to enhance and simplify healthcare information technology (IT) for users across the MHS. The goal is to deliver seamless health IT solutions to support healthcare delivery to 9.6 million military beneficiaries worldwide, improving patient care and experience and providing real-time information distribution while allowing for flexible healthcare options.

Prioritizing personalized care to deliver better health outcomes

Access to services, as well as the type of information available to patients, has a critical impact on patient behavior and individual health outcomes. Every beneficiary has a unique healthcare journey, and research from the National Institutes of Health shows that personalized experiences are more effective than rigid approaches for creating sustained health behavior change. In turn, this can positively impact health outcomes and support mission readiness.

Prioritizing personalized care requires consideration of various health conditions and life stages. For example, younger generations may want to access services and information in digital formats while other generations are less accustomed to online services. An example of this generation gap comes from my own family. My stepdaughter, who is active in the military, was interested in setting up an appointment with a business that I’ve used for years – only to learn it did not accept online bookings. So, she chose another option that fit her “anytime, anywhere” expectations for digital CX. Indeed, technology has radically changed our daily lives.

Healthcare agencies must serve both digital enthusiasts and those more comfortable with traditional technologies. Through decades of work with health agencies, including the VA, Maximus has learned valuable lessons by analyzing data about how people seek and receive services. Technologies that make this data actionable are now mature, accessible, and readily available.

One of the many advanced technologies successfully implemented in contact centers in recent years is an Intelligent Virtual Assistant, designed to deliver conversational self-service to the public. This technology allows them to use a multi-channel approach to provide access to critical information using the customer’s preferred method, enhancing the user experience by providing timely information.

Improving our nation’s military readiness

While the benefits of delivering personalized healthcare to service personnel and retirees, their families, and Veterans are easy to identify, the broader impact ultimately extends to national security. This comes at a time when military retirements are at an all-time high, and global threats are increasing. Amidst these vulnerabilities, maintaining a mission-ready military is vital.

To this end, unified Electronic Health Records (EHR) accessible from every base hospital to every field hospital ensure seamless continuation of care for service personnel regardless of where they are stationed, whether on temporary duty assignment (TDY) or deployed. Additionally, when service personnel have assurance that their families are being cared for, they can focus on the mission without distraction.

Delivering modernized healthcare today

By providing services through all available channels of a secure digital platform, agencies can succeed in delivering unified, tailored healthcare experiences. As agency leaders embrace personalized experiences to deliver a better standard of care, expert integration partners can deliver robust change management to understand beneficiary needs and ensure the right mix of advanced technologies is in place to address those needs and fulfill the mission. The future of healthcare lies in personalized care for all, enabled by technologies that offer choice and access—anytime, anywhere.",,N,0.0,2025-03-25 20:56:16.724052

Zynex is a medical device manufacturer that produces and markets electrotherapy devices for use in pain management and physical rehabilitation. The Company's products are small, battery powered electronic devices which deliver electric pulses via wires and electrode pads.

The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants shipped excess products to its customers and filed false claims with insurers, including Tricare (the health insurance program for the U.S. military), which inflated Zynex's revenue and resulted in the removal of Zynex from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed, among other things, Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme."" On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024. Finally, on March 11, 2025, after market hours, Zynex reported its 4Q24 and FY24 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

For up to the next five years, TRICARE will cover Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (MABs) lecanemab (brand name Leqembi) and donanemab (brand name Kisunla), for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment or in the mild dementia stage of the disease. The assistant secretary of defense for health affairs approved the change last October.

MOAA has worked to fix this coverage gap since the 118th Congress alongside stakeholders like The Military Coalition (TMC) – a group of military and veterans service organizations representing nearly 5.5 million members combined.

[MEMBER-EXCLUSIVE MOAA PUBLICATION: Transitioning Into Medicare and TRICARE For Life]

Reimbursement Options

MOAA has confirmed reimbursements for Leqembi and Kisunla are in effect. Beneficiaries whose claims were paid by Medicare but denied by TRICARE should contact the WPS customer service team for assistance in ensuring those claims are now processed under TRICARE For Life.

There is no need to submit a corrected claim – simply reach out with details on the affected claims for reconsideration.

You can contact the WPS customer service team through the TRICARE4u.com portal or by calling (866) 773-0404. Coverage is retroactive to Oct. 23, 2024, the provisional decision approval date.

Several impacted MOAA members initially alerted MOAA to this coverage gap; we appreciate their outreach, along with the support of members who reached out to their lawmakers on this issue via our Legislative Action Center.

Having both gives you more options for care, as well as the flexibility and freedom to choose providers within the VA or with a non-VA provider in your Medicare network. Plus, Medicare Advantage plans can come with extra benefits that most veterans don’t receive through the VA, such as dental, vision, gym memberships, over-the-counter allowances and transportation benefits.

How Medicare and VA benefits work together

Although you can have benefits through Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicare, you’ll need to choose which benefits you want to use when receiving care:

To use your VA benefits, you must visit a VA doctor or VA medical facility. The VA may also cover care at a non-VA facility if it’s preauthorized.

To use your Medicare benefits, you must receive care at a Medicare-authorized facility. In some cases, Medicare may also be able to pay for services the VA has not authorized.

What Medicare does and doesn’t cover will depend on your plan, where you’re receiving care, and which benefits you plan to use — if you can use both.

TRICARE and Medicare enrollment

As a veteran, your coverage under TRICARE ends once you become eligible for Medicare. That means you’ll need to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B during your Initial Enrollment Period to avoid any lapse in TRICARE coverage. When you enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, TRICARE will automatically switch to TRICARE For Life (TFL). TFL acts as supplemental coverage for your Medicare plan. That means Medicare is your primary payer, while TFL reduces or eliminates out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.

How Medicare and TRICARE work together

When you have Medicare and TRICARE For Life, you can visit any authorized provider. Here’s how the two work together to pay your health care costs:

The provider will file the claim(s) with Medicare.

Medicare will then pay the portion it’s responsible for and send the claim to the TRICARE For Life.

TRICARE For Life will pay its portion directly to the provider for the services TRICARE covers.

There are so many factors to consider when choosing the Medicare coverage that is right for you, and it can be an overwhelming process. We would love for you to schedule a free consultation to go over your unique needs. We want to empower you to choose the coverage that is the best for you.",https://lirp.cdn-website.com/038f6fe5/dms3rep/multi/opt/VA-1920w.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-26 05:56:17.979104

The Fort Carson Intrepid Spirit Center, or ISC, is a state-of-the-art treatment facility dedicated to the assessment and care of concussions and other forms of brain Injuries.

“As part of the Defense Intrepid Network, the Intrepid Spirit Center provides comprehensive care and support for service members, veterans, and their families who have experienced traumatic brain injuries,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Steve Spoonemore, a board-certified orthopedic clinical specialist and physical therapist with the Fort Carson ISC. “Our primary mission is getting service members back to duty in order to maintain an effective fighting force.”

Spoonemore says that many of the symptoms with traumatic brain injury are difficult to see externally yet impact the ability for service members to function in their military and family roles.

“The team-based care model helps us identify the associated symptoms of TBI, address them in comprehensive way, and empower the service member and family with tools to maintain optimum capability,” Spoonemore said.

Dr Brian Kelly, the deputy director of the ISC, says that these “invisible injuries” often go unrecognized, making events like this crucial.

“The military is deeply committed to addressing brain injuries to enhance warfighter readiness and improve quality of life during and after military service,” Kelly said. “The brain plays a vital role in numerous functions, from mood to memory to marksmanship. Just as soldiers once sharpened their swords for battle, we strive to ensure today’s service members have sharp minds, free from symptoms.”

Kelly says that treatment at the ISC is highly individualized based on patient needs and goals. Services provided often include medication management, physical therapy, occupational therapy, neuropsychology, speech and cognitive rehabilitation, art therapy, and music therapy.

The ISC also sees other TRICARE beneficiary categories, to include family members and retirees.

MARLTON, N.J., March 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Console & Associates, P.C. announced it is investigating a securities class action lawsuit filed in federal court on behalf of purchasers of Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

Investors who purchased Zynex securities during the Class Period may be entitled to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in this case. The lead plaintiff will represent other class members in directing the litigation and can potentially secure a more favorable recovery. Interested investors must file their motion with the Court no later than May 19, 2025.

Zynex, Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices for pain management and rehabilitation. The Company specializes in electrotherapy technology for non-invasive pain relief and muscle stimulation.

According to the complaint, during March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding Zynex's business and operations. Specifically, defendants allegedly failed to disclose that:

Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of patient need;

The Company inflated its revenue through these excessive shipment practices;

Zynex's practice of filing questionable claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare;

As a result, Zynex faced significant risk of adverse consequences, including potential removal from insurer networks and federal government penalties;

These practices made defendants' statements about Zynex's business, operations, and prospects materially misleading and/or lacking reasonable basis.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex announced its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" The Company also disclosed that ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare reportedly represents approximately 20-25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

Following this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

If you purchased Zynex securities during the Class Period and wish to serve as lead plaintiff in this case, you must file a motion with the Court no later than May 19, 2025. For more information about your legal rights and potential remedies, please complete our contact form.

There is no cost or obligation to you. The case is being pursued on a contingency fee basis, which means there will be no fees or costs to you if there is no recovery.

Why is the TOL Patient Portal decommissioning?

You can also book and cancel appointments,request prescription refills and renewals, see clinical notes and certain test results, and exchangesecure messages with your military healthcare team.

The change from TOL to MHS GENESIS eliminates the need to maintain two systems and streamlines EHR management.

Topline Phase 2 results for BX211 in diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) expected by end of March 2025

Initiated exploration and analysis of real-world evidence in people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) on the relationship between Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduction and clinical outcomes, ahead of expected regulatory discussions in second half of 2025

NESS ZIONA, Israel, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BiomX Inc. (NYSE American: PHGE, the “Company” or “BiomX”), a clinical-stage company advancing novel natural and engineered phage therapies that target specific pathogenic bacteria, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and provided program and business updates.

“BiomX is in the process of finalizing the analysis of topline results from the Phase 2 trial of BX211 in DFO, with readout expected by the end of the quarter,” said Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX. “In the first quarter of 2025, we also completed a financing round that generated $12 million in gross proceeds. We believe that these resources will enable readout of BX004 Phase 2b topline results, which are anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. In addition, the funds will support the analysis of real-world evidence to assess the relationship between Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduction and clinical outcomes in individuals with cystic fibrosis ahead of regulatory discussions expected in the second half of this year.”

Clinical Program Updates

BX211 – phage for the treatment of DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)

BiomX expects to report initial topline results from the Phase 2 trial evaluating BX211 for the treatment of DFO by the end of March 2025. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BX211 are being evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 study for individuals with DFO associated with S. aureus. The topline results will evaluate healing of the wound associated with osteomyelitis at Week 13. The Phase 2 study design was guided in part by experience with numerous compassionate cases using phage therapy for the treatment of DFO and osteomyelitis.

In October 2024, BiomX received a milestone payment from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA), approved to support the BX211 Phase 2 trial in DFO. To date, total non-dilutive funding received for this study has reached $36.8 million.

BX004 – fixed phage cocktail for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)

Trial remains on track to report topline results in the first quarter of 2026. During the fourth quarter of 2024, BiomX encountered manufacturing delays relating to scaling up of materials for the larger phase 2 trial. These challenges have since been resolved, supporting continued progress in the program.

Discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities are expected during the second half of 2025, during which the Company intends to present its analyses of real-world evidence and will seek to obtain endorsement that supports potential future regulatory filings.

Business Update

BiomX entered into a securities purchase agreement with investors in February 2025 in connection with a registered direct offering, concurrent private placement of the Company’s securities, and simultaneous exercise of certain existing common stock purchase warrants. Aggregate gross proceeds were approximately $12 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. Following these offerings, the Company expects to have sufficient funding to reach substantial inflection points, including topline results of its Phase 2b study of BX004 in the first quarter of 2026.

Full Year 2024 Financial Results

Cash balance and restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 were $18.0 million, compared to $15.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to funds raised in the Company’s March 2024 financing, partly offset by net cash used in operating activities. The December 31, 2024 cash balance does not reflect the additional $12 million in gross proceeds raised in the Company’s February 2025 financing round. BiomX estimates its cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits are sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Research and development expenses, net were $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $16.7 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of the Company’s CF product candidate, BX004; an increase in expenses relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s DFO product candidate, BX211; and an increase in rent and related expenses following the March acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). This increase was partly offset by higher governmental grants BiomX received.

General and administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $8.7 million for the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to a consolidation of expenses following APT’s acquisition, incorporating the combined workforce, increased professional services, and additional subcontractor expenses.

Goodwill impairment was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, following an impairment of the Company’s goodwill resulting from the APT acquisition. The Company had no goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2023.

IPR&D impairment was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, following the Company’s quantitative assessment for in process research and development (IPR&D) impairment. The Company had no IPR&D impairment in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Long-lived assets impairment was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, after evaluating the right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements following the Company’s decision to cease the use of the property in Gaithersburg, Maryland and make it available for sublease. The Company had no long-lived assets impairment in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Net loss for 2024 was $17.7 million, compared to $26.2 million for the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Company’s March 2024 financing.

Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $37 million, compared to $21.3 million for the same period in 2023.

Conference Call and Webcast

BiomX intends to host a conference call and a live audio webcast at a later date to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, in conjunction with its expected announcement of initial topline results from its Phase 2 trial for subjects with DFO.

About BX004

BiomX is developing BX004, a fixed multi-phage cocktail, for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa, a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. In November 2023, BiomX announced positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial where BX004 demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function associated with a reduction in P. aeruginosa burden compared to placebo in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced lung function (baseline FEV1P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004 or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The trial is designed to monitor the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. Pending progress of the trial, topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted BX004 Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation.

About BX211

BX211 is a phage treatment for the treatment of DFO associated with S. aureus. DFO is a bacterial infection of the bone that usually develops from an infected foot ulcer and is a leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes. The ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 trial investigating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BX211 for subjects with DFO associated with S. aureus has finished enrollment of patients, randomized at a 2:1 ratio of BX211 to placebo. BX211 or placebo is designed to be administered weekly, by topical and IV route at Week 1 and by the topical route only at each of Weeks 2-12. Over the 12-week treatment period, all subjects are expected to continue to be treated in accordance with standard of care which will include antibiotic treatment as appropriate. A first readout of study topline results is expected at Week 13 evaluating healing of the wound associated with osteomyelitis. This readout is expected in the first quarter of 2025.

The Fort Carson Intrepid Spirit Center, or ISC, is a state-of-the-art treatment facility dedicated to the assessment and care of concussions and other forms of brain Injuries.

“As part of the Defense Intrepid Network, the Intrepid Spirit Center provides comprehensive care and support for service members, veterans, and their families who have experienced traumatic brain injuries,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Steve Spoonemore, a board-certified orthopedic clinical specialist and physical therapist with the Fort Carson ISC. “Our primary mission is getting service members back to duty in order to maintain an effective fighting force.”

Spoonemore says that many of the symptoms with traumatic brain injury are difficult to see externally yet impact the ability for service members to function in their military and family roles.

“The team-based care model helps us identify the associated symptoms of TBI, address them in comprehensive way, and empower the service member and family with tools to maintain optimum capability,” Spoonemore said.

Dr Brian Kelly, the deputy director of the ISC, says that these ""invisible injuries"" often go unrecognized, making events like this crucial.

“The military is deeply committed to addressing brain injuries to enhance warfighter readiness and improve quality of life during and after military service,” Kelly said. “The brain plays a vital role in numerous functions, from mood to memory to marksmanship. Just as soldiers once sharpened their swords for battle, we strive to ensure today's service members have sharp minds, free from symptoms.”

Kelly says that treatment at the ISC is highly individualized based on patient needs and goals. Services provided often include medication management, physical therapy, occupational therapy, neuropsychology, speech and cognitive rehabilitation, art therapy, and music therapy.

The ISC also sees other TRICARE beneficiary categories, to include family members and retirees.

Taking a break from caregiving is not just important – it’s essential. Respite Care provides temporary support for your loved one while giving you the time to rest and recharge. In this guide, we walk you through how Respite Care works, what to expect, and how to arrange it with TriCare.

Understanding Respite Care

Respite Care is short-term, temporary care designed to give primary caregivers a break from their caregiving duties. It ensures that your loved one continues to receive high-quality support while you take time to rest, attend to personal matters, or simply recharge. This temporary care can be arranged for various durations, from a few hours to several weeks, depending on your needs and those of your loved one.

Overcoming guilt: taking a break is more than okay

We understand that making the decision to arrange Respite Care can be emotional. Many caregivers feel guilty about taking a break, especially if their loved one is reluctant to stay in an Aged Care Residence. However, it’s important to recognise that self-care is a crucial part of being an effective caregiver. By ensuring you are well-rested and supported, you can provide better care in the long run.

Respite Care also provides a beneficial experience for your loved one. A change of environment, opportunities for social interaction, and engaging activities can contribute to improved wellbeing. In many cases, residents enjoy their stay so much that they choose to return for future respite periods – or even transition to Permanent aged Care when the time is right.

The benefits of Respite Care in summary

Respite Care isn’t just beneficial for caregivers – it also provides real advantages for seniors.

For seniors:

Offers lots of new social engagement and companionship

Provides a fresh change of routine and new activities

Can help with recovery after illness or surgery

For caregivers:

Reduces stress and prevents burnout

Provides time to focus on personal needs

Allows for uninterrupted rest and relaxation

How the Respite Care process works

Step 1: Recognise the need for a break

As previously mentioned caregiver burnout is real, and it’s okay to acknowledge that you need support. If you’re feeling physically exhausted, emotionally drained, or struggling to balance your responsibilities, it may be time to consider Respite Care.

Step 2: Understand the types of Respite Care

At TriCare we offer residential Respite Care at various locations, where your loved one can stay for a short period. During their stay, they will receive 24-hour nursing care, access to engaging social activities, and support with daily living tasks in a safe and comfortable environment.

Other service providers may provide in-home Respite Care, if that’s more ideal for you. You can find those by searching for in-home Respite Care in your local area.

Step 3: Arrange an ACAT assessment if you haven’t already

To access government-subsidised Respite Care in Australia, your loved one will need an assessment from the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT). This free assessment determines their eligibility and level of care required.

How to apply: Contact My Aged Care [link: https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/assessment] at 1800 200 422 or apply online.

What to expect: An ACAT assessor will visit your home to evaluate your loved one’s physical, psychological, medical, and social needs. The process typically takes 1-3 hours.

Step 4: Choose a TriCare Aged Care Residence

Once your ACAT assessment is complete, we invite you to explore our Respite Care options. You can:

Visit our TriCare Aged Care Residential Respite Care page [link: https://www.tricare.com.au/aged-care/care-options/respite-care] for more details.

Then book a tour of one of our Aged Care Residences that provides Respite Care to meet our team and see the environment first-hand.

Step 5: Prepare for your loved one’s stay

Once you’ve chosen a residence, it’s time to prepare for your loved one’s respite stay. Here’s what you need to do:

Submit required documentation: We’ll guide you through the paperwork, including you providing your ACAT approval and medical records.

Pack personal belongings: Ensure your loved one has their essentials, such as clothing, toiletries, medications, and any comfort items that will help them feel more at home.

Communicate preferences: Share any specific care instructions with our team so we can personalise their experience.

Step 6: The Respite Care stay

During your loved one’s stay, they will be warmly welcomed by our experienced team and supported with:

Comfortable accommodation

Nutritious, chef-prepared meals

Engaging social activities and wellness programs

24/7 nursing care and medication management

Plus you are always welcome to stay in touch of course with our team to check on your loved one’s wellbeing.

Step 7: Returning home or planning for the future

Once the respite period ends, your loved one will either return home, feeling refreshed, or, in some cases, they may wish to explore transitioning into Permanent Aged Care. We are here to help guide you through either option, ensuring a smooth and stress-free process.

Why choose Respite Care at TriCare?

At TriCare, we understand the emotions and challenges associated with arranging Respite Care. That’s why we are committed to providing compassionate care in a warm and welcoming environment. Our team ensures that your loved one receives the best possible support while you take a well-deserved break.

A gentle reminder that choosing Respite Care is an essential act of care, it is not abandonment.

We’re here to make this process as easy and stress-free as possible, so you can take your break with confidence, knowing your loved one is in safe hands.

Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Securities Class Action:

The litigation is focused on the propriety of Zynex’s statements about its sales and billing practices, its revenue recognition practices, and its relationship with the military health program for active-duty soldiers and their family members (“Tricare”), which represents 20 – 25% of company’s revenue.

The complaint alleges that Zynex made false and misleading statements while failing to disclose crucial information to investors. More specifically, the suit alleges that:

Zynex shipped product, including electrodes, in excess of customers’ needs;

As a result of this practice, Zynex inflated its revenues;

Zynex’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

As a. result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and penalties by the federal government.

Investors began to learn the truth on June 4, 2024, when medical journal STAAT published “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” This report claimed that Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” STAAT further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The company’s Q4 revenue implied a 2% drop from the year-earlier period and YE net income per share plummeted from $0.27 in 2023 to $0.09 in 2024. According to Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard “[o]ur fourth quarter revenue was less than expected[]” and “[t]he shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.”

“We are concerned about potential issues with Zynex’s revenue recognition and sales practices,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

If you invested in Zynex and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

Whether we’re deployed, training stateside, or sitting down with family at home, the food we consume not only fuels our bodies but also strengthens our bonds with one another. Reflecting on the importance of proper nutrition for health and the acknowledgement of how food unites us as a community. These concepts ring true with service members, where shared meals support mission readiness and build camaraderie.

The Importance of Nutrition in the Military

In the military, nutrition is more than a personal choice – it’s a mission-critical component. Every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, and Guardian depends on proper nutrition to perform at their peak. Balanced diets rich in essential nutrients enhance physical endurance, mental clarity and recovery from intense activity. For example, incorporating complex carbohydrates, lean proteins and healthy fats into meals provides sustained energy for rucksack marches or demanding physical training sessions. Vitamins and minerals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports immune function, ensuring service members stay fit to fight. Hydration is another cornerstone of nutrition, as staying hydrated supports cognitive function and minimizes fatigue.

For service members who are training or deployed, operational rations, such as Meals, Ready-to-Eat, or MREs, or Unitized Groups Rations, known as UGRs, are designed to meet nutritional needs in challenging environments. While these rations may not replace the comfort of a home-cooked meal, they demonstrate how food is tailored to meet specific missions and sustain service members around the world.

Food as a Cultural Bridge

We all know that food is not just fuel—it’s a bridge that connects people across cultures, ranks and generations. Service members experience this firsthand. Shared meals in the dining facility, potlucks during holidays, and barbecues after field exercises all create opportunities to foster relationships and build unit cohesion. When service members are deployed, dining can become a moment of connection that boosts morale and sustains resilience.

“As the military sends service members all around the world, one of the many benefits of experiencing new cultures is also trying new foods,” said Joanna Reagan, a public health nutritionist with Defense Health Agency – Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Opportunities to eat or cook in new locations expands knowledge of spices, cooking styles, new ingredients and shopping experiences. Certainly, the location affects how adventurous one might be in trying new foods while keeping the principles of food safety in mind.”

Food also connects us to our heritage and reminds us of home. A meal from childhood or a favorite family recipe shared during downtime can provide comfort and strengthen resilience for service members stationed far away from friends and family. Sharing traditional dishes from another culture promotes understanding, camaraderie and appreciation of diversity.

“Sharing your favorite recipes and traditions with others can create lifetime memories, not to mention expanding your list of favorite recipes,” added Reagan.

Leading by Example

Military leaders play a vital role in modeling healthy eating habits. Leaders have an opportunity to model healthy habits that may influence service members’ behaviors. Demonstrating a commitment to nutrition by choosing balanced meals, encouraging hydration, and avoiding excessive junk food sets a positive example.

“Military leaders shape the culture of eating habits within the units they lead,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Melissa Troncoso, a family nurse practitioner and researcher at the Uniformed Services University’s Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing in Bethesda, Maryland. “Through their food choices, recommendations for unit events, and advocacy for healthier options within the food environment, they can promote a lifestyle of good nutrition.”

Leaders can also advocate for nutrition education. Military installations offer resources such as dietitians and health promotion programs designed to educate service members and their families on healthy eating. At Armed Forces Wellness Centers, service members and their families; retirees; and Department of Defense civilians can utilize health coaches to revie w health habits, analyze risk factors or explore personal health and wellness goals. AFWCs can be found on many installations. Leaders encouraging their teams to take advantage of these resources promotes mission readiness as well as long-term health and well-being.

Strengthening Family Bonds Through Food

For families, food is often the centerpiece of connection. Whether they gather to share a holiday meal or a quick dinner before a parent heads out for a late-night duty shift, families can enjoy spending time eating together.

Military spouses and children also play an important role in maintaining the nutritional health of the household. Preparing meals together can teach children about healthy eating habits and provide a sense of normalcy amid the unique challenges of military life. Cooking as a family is a chance to strengthen relationships and create lasting memories.

“Loneliness and isolation increase the risk for individuals to develop mental health challenges,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Melissa Boyd, a clinical psychologist with DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen. “Sitting down together to build connection over food can improve the physical and mental health of all family members involved and has been linked to preventing eating disorders, alcohol and substance abuse, violence, depression and suicidality.”

Family meals also encourage open communication and motivate parents to listen to children talk about their day, which communicates they are valued, said Boyd.

Research has shown that family meals support the health and well-being of children and parents, demonstrating the benefits of spending time together during meals for the whole family.

Conclusion

Take a moment to appreciate the many ways food impacts our lives. In the military, food is not only fuel — it enhances unity, resilience, and readiness. Prioritizing nutrition and sharing meals together strengthens the bonds that make our military community unique.

This month, take the opportunity to evaluate your nutritional habits and find ways to connect with those around you through food. Whether you’re sitting down for a meal with your team, trying a new recipe with your family, or learning about the cuisine of another culture, let food be the common ground that connects you to the people in your life.

Related: Military Medical System Not Ready for War Due to Cuts and Delayed Reforms, Experts Warn Story Continues","Ahead of his confirmation hearing Thursday to become assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, Keith Bass is facing tough questions from a prominent Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Bass, a retired Navy commander and substance abuse counselor who previously led the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Medical Services and the White House Medical Unit, was nominated Dec. 22 to manage the Defense Department's $61 billion health system, which serves 9.5 million beneficiaries, including 1.3 million active-duty troops.

The health affairs assistant secretary is responsible for protecting and preserving the health of the armed forces, setting policy, and managing the Pentagon's health budget. He also serves as senior adviser on health issues relevant to beneficiaries for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

But the military health system currently is facing challenges on multiple fronts, including staffing shortages at medical facilities, patient retention issues that have affected provider training and proficiency, and problems within the Tricare health program that have resulted in delays in patient care and payments to providers.

In a letter to Bass on Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ranking member of the Armed Services personnel subcommittee, questioned whether he is up to the task.

Citing Bass' experiences at the White House and CIA, which were investigated by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and in media reports for reported mismanagement, Warren said she had concerns that he is ""not capable of filling the role.""

According to an article in SpyTalk cited by Warren, Bass allegedly was fired as head of the CIA medical office following his mishandling of the investigation into Havana syndrome, also known as anomalous health incidents, that affected more than 330 U.S. State Department, intelligence and defense officials as a result of exposure to painful, piercing noise from an unknown source.

The article also pointed to Bass' alleged mishandling of the COVID-19 response at the agency, ""afflicting its rank and file.""

Warren also cited a DoD IG report released last January that found that, during Bass' tenure at the White House, civilian staff members who weren't eligible for military health services -- an average six to 20 patients a week -- received specialty care and surgeries at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital in Virginia, and elsewhere.

That investigation also found that the unit distributed sedatives including Ambien and stimulants such as Provigil to ineligible beneficiaries, often without a prescription.

Warren asked Bass whether he was aware of ""severe and systemic problems"" under his watch.

""At best, you were oblivious to the wider distribution of sedatives and stimulants by White House pharmacy operations and, in the worst case, you were complicit. Either scenario should disqualify you from serving as the [assistant secretary of defense for health affairs],"" Warren wrote.

In his most recent position, Bass led the West Texas VA Health Care System, overseeing a medical center with an operating budget of $153 million and 1,120 employees, serving 24,000 veterans.

President Donald Trump announced Bass' nomination along with several other Defense Department leaders on Dec. 22, calling them ""a slate of America First patriots.""

""Keith is a retired Navy commander with over 30 years of health care experience. ... Keith will be leading the charge to ensure our troops are healthy, and receiving the best medical care possible,"" Trump wrote in an announcement.

Bass' appearance at his nomination hearing will be the first time he has made public statements about his plans for the military health system.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, a retired Navy interventional radiologist who served as chief medical officer at the CIA, has served as acting assistant secretary for health affairs since January and, since assuming the duty, has traveled throughout the military health system, including a trip to U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay in Cuba last month.

Ferrara has pledged to ensure that the military health system realigns its efforts to support and provide combat medicine.

""And it's a moral imperative ... when America's sons and daughters go down range and go into harm's way, we honor the pact they make and that their parents made when they sort of handed their children over to us to do those missions that, should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,"" Ferrara said during a military health conference March 3.

The Senate Armed Services Committee will hear testimony Thursday from three other nominees in addition to Bass: Troy Meink to be Air Force secretary; Michael Duffey, proposed undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment; and Emil Michael as undersecretary of defense for research and engineering.

In her letter, sent to Bass via the White House, Warren requested answers to her questions in writing by Wednesday.

""Given your checkered past ... I am concerned that, if you are confirmed, you will not be able to effectively manage the military health care system, placing care at risk for millions. I urge you to demonstrate a commitment to clarity,"" Warren wrote.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

I'm confused about how my current postal insurance will work with reserve military insurance (Tricare). I'm hoping other experienced reservists in this sub can give me advice and cclarification.

Right now I'm currently paying into postal health and dental insurance (high option) and also signed up for FSA which I will be contributing the max amount ($3,300). My postal insurance premium is about $176 a month for me and my dependent wife. Looking at Tricare Reserve Select, the family option is about $275 a month.

The part that confuses me is...(based on a discussion I had in r/navyreserve ; you can look up my post history).

I was told that I can't get Tricare if I already have FEHB (can someone provide the official documentation on this?) That said, someone else said that I will be on Tricare while I attend boot camp and A-School. Do I just tell the admins at boot camp that I already have FEHB or do I need to contact postal HR to put a pause on my postal insurance while I'm away with the military? (And then what about my wife? I don't want to risk gaps in her insurance coverage).

Also, while FEHB is cheaper for me since I'm on a postal union-sponsored healthplan, Tricare is more appealing to me since it definitely seems to have better coverage overall despite the higher premiums. That said, is there a way to opt out of FEHB and then go on Tricare fulltime? (Due to my FSA account this year, I probably have to ride out the postal insurance until the next open season).",,N,0.0,2025-03-24 14:56:20.737164

In conjunction with the Floral Association’s Homefront Judging, which takes place March 28-30, Emerald Keepers will be recognizing earth-friendly home fronts. Homes can receive both Floral Association ribbons and green Emerald Keepers ribbons.

Volunteers are still needed for earth-friendly home front judging. No experience or knowledge needed. Sign up online and include Emerald Keepers in the comment box.

Considerations to earn an earth-friendly green ribbon include:

Limited to no lawn. Grass is water and energy intensive and provides limited benefits to our local biodiversity. Home fronts should be no more than 25% grass.

Limited to no artificial grass. Fake grass should be avoided. Made out of plastic, it harms the soil, wildlife, and human health. The benefits from using less water with artificial grass are far outweighed by the environmental harm caused by this plastic ground cover. No more than 10% of a garden should be covered with artificial grass.

Majority native or low-water plants. Support bees, birds, and butterflies with low-maintenance native and drought-resistant plants that thrive in Coronado’s soil and climate.

Natural mulches covering soil. Mulches such as bark, rocks, sand, and decomposed granite retain moisture, limiting the need for watering. They also inhibit the growth of weeds and therefore the need for chemical weed killers.

Majority ground surface non-paved. Permeable, non-paved ground surfaces allow for water absorption into the soil rather than runoff. Patios are acceptable if there is permeable space between pavers.

Green ribbon home fronts must also meet the Coronado Flower Show requirements for obvious effort, good maintenance, and curb appeal.

Home fronts include the parkway strip between the sidewalk and the street. While the strip is city property, homeowners are responsible for its maintenance. This visible space presents another opportunity to expand your earth-friendly impact.

In 2024, 319 homes were recognized for their earth-friendly landscaping. The winner was 801 Country Club Lane; 931 J Avenue took second place; and 1001 E Avenue came in third place. The winners exhibited an attractive and thoughtful combination of drought-tolerant plants and permeable hardscape that extended to the parkway strip. A full list of 2024 earth-friendly home front winners can be viewed online at emeraldkeepers.org/earthfriendly.

I was looking at the cost of Tricare Reserve Select ( https://www.tricare.mil/Costs ), and the family option is $274.48. Therefore, I am led to believe that my postal health/dental insurance is cheaper, but my question is: is military insurance mandatory while I am actively serving (training, schooling, deployment, etc.)? Is there a way to opt out of military insurance or am I forced to use it since I will be in LWOP status with my civilian job?

Also, I read somewhere that there is no enrollment window for Tricare (i.e. you can enroll whenever you want), is that true or do certain conditions have to be met?",,N,0.0,2025-03-24 00:56:17.752557

From the above, it looks like you’ve already met the point of service deductible, meaning your family has been getting specialty care without referrals, and you’ve met that deductible. Now you’re on the hook for 50% of cost. Your best bet is to convince the pcm to put in a referral after the fact and then argue with Tricare to apply it to the claim.

The first question would be did she have a referral? But also if she did talk with your provider because tricare changed some stuff in their system and led to claims being denied. I have them say that me as the service member was going to be responsible for $6300 that I had preauthorization for. Turns out it was an error on tricare’s side",,N,-1.0,2025-03-23 16:56:14.904006
