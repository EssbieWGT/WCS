Transition to a Payor-focused model and expansions of networks like Medicare and TRICARE promise revenue growth and improved profitability through a stable customer base.

AI-driven technologies and operational efficiencies enhance member engagement and reduce costs, leading to improved net margins and increased earnings.

Focus on Payor models and tech investments poses profitability and growth risks amid declining consumer revenue and marketing challenges.

Catalysts

About Talkspace

Operates as a virtual behavioral healthcare company that connects patients with licensed mental health providers in the United States.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

Expansion to Medicare and TRICARE networks will unlock coverage for significant new populations, potentially increasing revenue due to a broader customer base.

The shift from a consumer subscription model to a Payor-focused approach has increased coverage to 179 million people, which is likely to enhance revenue growth and improve net margins due to a more predictable and scale-efficient business model.

The development and implementation of AI-driven technologies, such as Talkcast and other tools to improve the member journey, can enhance member engagement and retention, potentially boosting revenue and net margins by decreasing churn and increasing utilization rates.

Operational efficiencies, such as a decrease in operating expenses and an overall increase in the effectiveness of marketing spend, should improve net margins and earnings.

Strategic partnerships and marketing initiatives focused on covered life populations, like the military and Medicare recipients, are anticipated to enhance revenue growth and sustained profitability due to higher return on investment in these targeted marketing efforts.

Talkspace Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

Analysts are assuming Talkspace's revenue will grow by 21.4% annually over the next 3 years.

Analysts assume that profit margins will increase from 0.6% today to 11.4% in 3 years time.

Analysts expect earnings to reach $38.1 million (and earnings per share of $0.19) by about April 2028, up from $1.1 million today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the analysts price target, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 25.8x on those 2028 earnings, down from 457.8x today. This future PE is greater than the current PE for the US Healthcare industry at 23.8x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to decline by 0.74% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 6.21%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Talkspace Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The shift towards a Payor-focused model and the resulting decline in gross margins may pose a risk to overall profitability, as the company navigates the trade-off between lower gross margins and the anticipated long-term benefits of improved unit economics.

Decreasing consumer revenue, as Talkspace focuses on Payor and DTE models, could negatively impact top-line growth if Payor-based strategies do not expand as projected, affecting revenue growth and market penetration.

Challenges in marketing strategies, particularly reaching new segments like Medicare and military populations, could lead to inefficient spend and slower user acquisition, impacting revenue growth.

Potential pricing pressures in negotiations with Payors, if they were to arise, could influence revenue levels negatively, despite current stable pricing conditions.

Heavy reliance on technologies to improve member retention and engagement may not yield expected results, which could adversely affect earnings by not generating sufficient return on investment in technological enhancements.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The analysts have a consensus price target of $5.0 for Talkspace based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors.

In order for you to agree with the analyst's consensus, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $335.8 million, earnings will come to $38.1 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 25.8x, assuming you use a discount rate of 6.2%.

Given the current share price of $3.12, the analyst price target of $5.0 is 37.6% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

,,2025-04-26 13:49:58+00:00,BioMed Central,Analysis of rare events in healthcare intervention using department of defense data,Not Available,,,,,https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-025-02559-5,"One real-life example is working with data on a rare disease such as bullous pemphigoid (BP), a rare skin condition.
Thus, \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}})\) will be larger for 1’s than 0’s, stating that 1’s are more informative than 0’s in rare events.
Since rare events have small sample sizes (usually < 200 observations), the logit models will yield a suboptimal result [7].
Table 2 shows the coefficients from standard logistic regression, prior correction regression, weighting regression, and reduced non-event sample regression.
These methods, based mostly on large-sample normal approximation (particularly inverse-variance) [31,32,33], lack power to investigate the incidence of rare events.","In outcomes research data, we deal with rare cases frequently. Currently, about 7,000 rare diseases have been identified, with an estimated 300 million people affected globally [1]. Rare diseases, although individually unique, collectively represent substantial unmet health and social care needs and a significant public health challenge to society as a whole [1]. Definitions of rare diseases vary: [1] under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, a rare disease is defined as a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals [2], whereas it is defined as a condition that affects fewer than 5 people per 10,000 population in Europe [1].

It is estimated that 95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment [1, 3, 4]. The treatments for the remaining 5% are frequently expensive and relatively unknown. In addition to the high research and development costs associated with largely limited treatment options, the rather small market for rare diseases is conducive to prohibitive pricing. Rare diseases present a challenge for clinicians in reaching a conclusive diagnosis and determining an appropriate course of treatment due to their low prevalence, heterogenicity, and complexity [1, 5, 6]. Thus, it can be challenging to predict and estimate rare-disease outcomes in a real-world setting.

A rare event is defined as a binary dependent variable characterized by dozens to thousands of times fewer 1’s (i.e., rare diseases, treatments, newly approved medications) than 0’s (“nonevents”) [7]. There are two main reasons for the difficulty in estimating rare events.

First, standard logistic regression can sharply underestimate the probability of events. Therefore, the estimates would be biased. One real-life example is working with data on a rare disease such as bullous pemphigoid (BP), a rare skin condition. It is estimated that BP affects fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S., primarily older people [8]. The most common treatment is prednisone, but long-term use increases the risk of weak bones, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and infection. As an alternative, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is effective, although optimal use of IVIg is yet to be determined. Most adverse effects of IVIg infusions are transient, infusion-related symptoms that do not have long-term sequelae, although serious adverse events such as thrombosis, renal dysfunction, and acute renal failure have been noted [9]. Additional concerns about IVIg treatment include its potential toxicity and cost. While a single infusion starts at $5,000 to $10,000, treatment usually requires repeated cycles for which insurance coverage is not always covered. Therefore, it is essential to know the probability of using IVIg treatment for a rare disease.

To study the usage pattern of IVIg therapy in BP, we can formulate the model as follows: Let the outcome variable (e.g., whether the patient had IVIg therapy) be \(\:{y}_{i}\) and follow a Bernoulli probability function that takes on the value 1 with probability \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}\). Let \(\:{x}_{i}\) be the vector of explanatory variables such as age, comorbid conditions, gender, or insurance type. Then it can be shown that the variance matrix takes the following form:

$$\:V\left(\widehat{\beta\:}\right)={\left[{\sum\:}_{\text{i}=1}^{\text{n}}{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}}\left(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{1}\right){\text{x}}_{\text{i}}{x}_{i}^{{\prime\:}}\right]}^{-1}$$

Rare events have small estimates for \(\:{{\uppi\:}}_{i}\) observations. Standard logit models that use approximation rather than actual values will usually have larger values for \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}\). Thus, \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}})\) will be larger for 1’s than 0’s, stating that 1’s are more informative than 0’s in rare events. Since rare events have small sample sizes (usually < 200 observations), the logit models will yield a suboptimal result [7]. Therefore, logit models need to be adjusted to control this effect.

The second problem is related to how the data are collected. There is a fear among analysts that collecting data sets with no events (and thus with no variation on outcome measures) has led researchers to choose very large data sets with few, and often poorly measured, explanatory variables. For example, to avoid rare events, a researcher could include a broader sample by including a wide variety of International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes, a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II alphanumeric code issued by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (J-Codes), or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes rather than specific codes. This technique will cloud the estimates, making it challenging to see the true effect of treatment on an actual targeted sample.

The twofold problem outlined above arises when predicting health outcomes of rare diseases, rare treatments, or small numbers of recently approved medications. The objective of this study is to apply correction methods used in other rare event studies such as major stock market crashes to solve the aforementioned issues in performing research on rare diseases.

For this retrospective cross-sectional study, we extracted de-identified patient data for fiscal years (FYs) 2019 to 2022 from the Department of Defense TRICARE data. Each FY (October 1–September 30) is based on the U.S. federal budget calendar. The data from Military Health Services (MHS) has been recognized as a model of equitable healthcare access across socioeconomic and racial groups. The U.S. MHS is a global healthcare network with a diverse population that is more representative of the U.S. population than other data sets, with fewer disparities in healthcare services. The system serves 9.6 million beneficiaries, including active-duty service members, retirees, and family members, on an annual budget of $53 billion. The MHS delivers care through a direct-care/health maintenance organization system for Department of Defense military treatment facilities and a purchased-care/preferred provider organization system for civilian facilities. In addition, the MHS provides universal coverage for its beneficiaries under its TRICARE program. The data do not capture healthcare delivery in combat zones or care received in the Veterans Administrative system. All individuals were in the TRICARE Prime® managed care option.

Patients with BP were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes (L12.0). Our outcome variable was the use of IVIg therapy and identified by J codes (J1459, J1554, J1556, J1557, J1561, J1566, J1568, J1569, J1572, J1599). The inclusion criteria used were adults (≥ 18 years), diagnosed with BP and treated with or without IVIg. IVIg date was the index date; the index date for the non-event cohort was randomly assigned between the earliest IVIg date and latest IVIg date.

Patient age, gender, and comorbidities were available in the data sets. We identified the top 10 comorbidities associated with BP. Hypertension emerged as one of the most prevalent comorbidities in patients with BP, with studies reporting its occurrence in up to 76% of cases [10]. The association between hypertension and BP is hypothesized to stem from shared inflammatory pathways or medication effects. Esophageal involvement is another frequent complication in BP cases, potentially manifesting as reflux symptoms or, in some instances, esophagitis dissecans superficialis [11]. Dermatological comorbidities are also common in patients with BP. Research has demonstrated an increased risk of BP in patients with pre-existing dermatitis, and BP may initially present with eczematous or urticarial lesions before the characteristic blistering occurs [12]. Rash, a primary symptom of BP itself, often manifests as urticarial plaques preceding blister formation [13]. Urinary tract involvement is another significant comorbidity in patients with BP. One study reported characteristic lower urinary tract lesions in 93% of BP cases [14]. The increased prevalence of urinary tract infections in patients with BP is attributed to advanced age and the use of immunosuppressive treatments [14]. Neurological comorbidities are frequently observed in patients with BP, often manifesting as limb pain. Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been found to have a significant association with BP, with one study reporting an odds ratio of 5.36 for neurological diseases, including MS, in patients with BP [15]. Cardiovascular comorbidities are also prevalent in patients with BP, with dyspnea being a common related symptom [16]. Additionally, several studies have reported an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in patients with BP [17]. A flag was created for patients who had at least three of the following comorbidities: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, esophagitis reflux, dermatitis, urinary tract infection, limp pain, rash, skin cancer, dyspnea, and MS prior to treatment to proxy for severity.

For descriptive analysis, we compared the patients with and without IVIg therapy. Numbers and percentages were provided for dichotomous and polychotomous variables. Means and standard deviations were provided for continuous variables. For dichotomous and polychotomous variables, P values were calculated according to the chi-square test, and for continuous variables, t-tests were used to calculate P values. Nonparametric tests (e.g., the Mann-Whitney U test, log-rank test, or McNemar test) were applied if there was a deviation from asymptotical assumptions.

Since it is well documented that logit coefficients are biased in small samples, we proposed a correction method to solve the possible “rare event” bias in log estimation. Consider a logit model for outcome variable y and set of k explanatory variables x:

$$\:\left[P\right(y=1\left|x\right)=\:G({{\upbeta\:}}_{0}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{1}{x}_{1}+\dots\:+{{\upbeta\:}}_{k}{x}_{k})],$$

where G is the logistic function:

$$\:G\left(z\right)=\:exp\left(z\right)/\left[1+exp\left(z\right)\right],$$

which is between 0 and 1 for all real numbers z.

To apply the first correction method, we obtained information about the fraction of 1’s in the population \(\:{\uprho\:},\) and then the observed fraction of ones in the sample \(\:\stackrel{-}{y}\). Then the adjusted coefficient in the logit model is

$$\:\widehat{{{\upbeta\:}}_{0}}-ln\:\left[\left(\frac{1-\rho\:}{\rho\:}\right)\left(\frac{\stackrel{-}{y}}{1-\stackrel{-}{y}}\right)\right].$$

Note that prior correction affects only constant terms (therefore, not the odds ratio), but since most of the time interest lies in estimated probabilities:

$$\:{\pi\:}_{i}=\:{\left(1-{e}^{({\beta\:}_{0}+{\beta\:}_{1}{x}_{1}+\dots\:+{\beta\:}_{k}{x}_{k})}\right)}^{-1},$$

it is necessary to estimate a rare-event bias-adjusted constant term, with the first correction technique, called prior correction.

For the second correction technique, we used weights determined by the proportion of 1’s and 0’s in the sample to equal the true proportion in the population, letting \(\:{w}_{1}=\frac{\rho\:}{\stackrel{-}{y}}\) and \(\:{w}_{o}=\frac{1-\rho\:}{1-\stackrel{-}{y}}\) be the dependent variable and weighting independent variables by \(\:{w}_{1}\) if \(\:{y}_{i}=1\:\)and \(\:{w}_{o}\) if \(\:{y}_{i}=0.\) Then, we ran a standard logistic regression of weighted dependent and independent variables. In other words, the second correction technique aims to address the issue of imbalanced data in logistic regression by applying weights to both the dependent and independent variables. The rationale for this technique is to adjust the influence of each observation in the model to reflect the true events (1’s) and nonevents (0’s) in the population. By doing so, it attempts to correct for the bias introduced by imbalanced samples, where one class may be overrepresented or underrepresented compared with the true population. For example, if age=75 and w=1, the age variable would remain 75, but the observation would be a given weight of 1.5 in the model fitting process. This means that this observation would have 1.5 times the influence on the model parameters compared with an observation with a weight of 1. To solve commonly used data collection biases under rare-event data, King and Zeng have proposed collecting all (or all available) 1’s and a small random sample of 0’s to avoid losing consistency or even much efficiency relative to the full sample [7]. Wang et al. have also proposed an adjusted logistic propensity weighting method, a more advanced version of this approach [18]. Both methods were validated under different scenarios (e.g., varying sample sizes, different event rates) using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, as described in previous research [7].

For the second part of the analysis, we tested differences in predicted probabilities. We proposed nonparametric tests since these tests are most appropriate when the sample sizes are small. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test were used on predicted probabilities of logit regressions to see whether differences exist. To assess the independence of our predictor variables in the regression model, we employed two established methods: variance inflation factor analysis and examination of pairwise correlations.

The analysis used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) and STATA 17 (STATA Corp., LLC).

We identified 2,720 unique individuals diagnosed with BP in FY 2019–2022. Among these patients diagnosed with BP, 14 were treated with IVIg. The remaining sample was a non-event cohort (n = 2,706). Overall, 54.19% of individuals were women, and 85% of our sample was 65 years or older (mean, 78 years). We identified the most frequent 10 comorbidities from our sample. According to Table 1, the most frequent comorbidity prior to treatment with IVIg was hypertension (61.32%), followed by hyperlipidemia (37.20%), pemphigoid (34.70%), pain limp (24.15%), dyspnea (23.82%), dermatitis (23.49%), skin cancer (22.31%), urinary tract infection (20.25%), esophageal reflux (19.44%), and rash (16.43%). Within this sample, 54.08% of patients had more than three comorbidities within one year prior to treatment.

Patients with BP receiving IVIg therapy were younger (65.07 vs. 75.85, P =.0016) and more likely to be female (13 vs. 1, P =.0036). Overall, patients with IVIg treatment had significantly more comorbidities than patients without IVIg therapy. (78.57% vs. 53.95%, P =.0653). Patients receiving IVIg therapy also had a significantly higher likelihood of esophageal reflux (42.85% vs. 19.44%, P =.0265), dermatitis (57.14% vs. 23.49%, P =.0029), urinary tract infection (50.00% vs. 20.25%), P =.0055), and rash (42.85% vs., 16.43%, P =.0075).

Table 2 shows the coefficients from standard logistic regression, prior correction regression, weighting regression, and reduced non-event sample regression.

The correction rate for the prior correction technique assumes that the IVIg rate for BP is 0.00538918 (\(\:\rho\:)\). This rate is obtained from an open-claims database that covers 330 million patients in the United States. When comparing unadjusted rates for IVIg treatment, our rates were lower (0.00515). There was agreement on the sign of the coefficients across regressions. Older age, male self-identification, and fewer comorbidities decreased the likelihood of BP being treated with IVIg. Coefficients from weighting and prior correction logistic regression were statistically similar, but both were statistically different from and standard logistic regression (P =.0001). The coefficients from the regression that used the reduced random sample of non-events were also different from standard logistic regression (P =.004) (Table 2).

We randomly selected 140 patients from 2,706 non-event patients, so the total regression sample was 154, with 10% of the sample in the IVIg cohort (i.e., the rare-event proportion increased from 0.5% to 10%). The reduced random sample increased the event proportion in the regression sample. We calculated event probabilities for each group of patients with respect to age, gender, and comorbidities (Table 3). As expected, standard logistic regression significantly underestimated the event probabilities. The underestimation ranged from 11% to 102% using the prior correction method and from 15% to 107% using the weighting correction method. For example, standard logistic regression predicted that male patients 18 to 64 years old with few comorbidities have a 0.1% probability of receiving IVIg treatment; however, the actual probability was double according to prior correction and weighting correction. Random selection of non-event samples significantly biased the results and found probabilities 10 times larger than corrected probabilities and 20 times larger than probabilities calculated by standard logistic regression.

Rare-event correction affected the constant term the most. Table 3 shows the constant term for each model with its lower and upper confidence intervals.

The development of rare-event sampling techniques can be traced back to the early 1950s, primarily motivated by the need to solve complex problems in nuclear physics, particularly the neuron shielding problem that was crucial for designing nuclear facilities [19]. Later, researchers addressed the challenge of extremely rare events using Monte Carlo random sampling [20]. The importance of sampling methods, another key technique in rare-event simulation, also emerged during this period, setting the stage for the evolution of rare-event sampling techniques that continue to be refined and applied in various fields today [21]. For example, in physics, the search for dark matter involves detecting extremely rare particle interaction [22]. In earth sciences, methods were developed to analyze extremely rare natural disasters with occurrence rates of 1% or less [23]. In the telecommunication sector, researchers have focused on detecting and analyzing rare network anomalies [24]. In political science, case study approaches are used to analyze rare events like successful coups or the peaceful dissolution of countries [7, 25]. In economics, agent-based modeling used to simulate complex financial systems and identify conditions that may lead to rare market crashes [26]. In health care, researchers are used genomic sequencing techniques to identify genetic markers associated with rare disorders or Bayesian hierarchal models applied to analyze small sample sizes typical in rare diseases [27, 28]. Here, we applied a logistic regression technique for rare event rates among large sample sizes.

Due to the structured data entry system used by TRICARE, the data set used in this study had minimal missing data. Across all variables included in the analysis, less than 1% of data points were missing. This extremely low rate of missingness did not warrant the use of advanced imputation techniques or separate complete case analyses. The completeness of the TRICARE data contributes to the robustness of the findings and minimizes potential bias from missing information.

While the traditional rule of thumb for logistic regression suggests 10 to 20 events per variable are necessary, recent research has shown that this guideline can be relaxed under certain circumstances [29]. When dealing with rare events, total sample size becomes more critical than the number of events alone. The large sample size of 2,720 provides substantial information even with only 14 events. The empirical example provided here illustrates why specialized techniques for rare events logistic regression were developed. Several correction techniques were applied to a rare treatment for BP using a military health data set. As expected, the results yielded that standard logistic regression significantly underestimated the event probabilities. The underestimation in this study ranged from 11% to 102% using the prior correction method and from 15% to 106% using the weighting correction method. For example, in this study, standard logistics regression predicted that male patients 18 to 64 years old, with fewer comorbidities, have a 0.1% probability of receiving IVIg treatment; however, the actual probability was more than double according to prior correction and weighting correction. This discrepancy could give rise to a large margin of error and, ultimately, cost-ineffective decisions.

Furthermore, this study showed that the random selection of non-event samples significantly biased the results. The probabilities were found to be 10 times larger than the corrected probabilities and 20 times larger than the probabilities calculated by standard logistic regression. These results support King and Zeng’s findings, which indicated that a second, more important common problem in analyzing rare events lies in how data are collected [7]. The reduced sample size in this study demonstrated the most bias, supporting the idea that data collection can greatly influence results.

Other techniques such as meta-analysis have been suggested for rare event bias correction. However, meta-analyses of binary data can be problematic when the proportion of events is low [30, 31]. Meta-analyses of binary data are frequently performed using the standard inverse-variance fixed-effects model, based on large-sample normal approximation, or fixed-effects methods, based on exact distributional theory such as the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) or Peto model, or the standard random-effects DerSimonian-Laird (DL) model [31]. These methods, based mostly on large-sample normal approximation (particularly inverse-variance) [31,32,33], lack power to investigate the incidence of rare events. Therefore, their statistical properties for estimating treatment effects are often judged as suboptimal either through biased results, inappropriately wide confidence intervals, or insignificant statistical power to detect true differences.

The Cochrane guidelines (version 6.1, 2020) recommend the use of methods mostly accessible in Review Manager (RevMan), a free-access software developed by the Nordic Cochrane Centre [31, 33]. Its guideline suggests that, at event rates less than 1%, the Peto odds ratio should be utilized [31]. In circumstances where event rates are above 1% and meta-analyses involves many studies with imbalanced treatment groups, the MH odds ratio should be used [31, 34]. However, some of these methods, notably, the MH without continuity correction, logistic regression, and exact methods, are not available in RevMan. Second, meta-analysts must often revert from inverse-variance weighting to a random-effects DL model to reduce bias in estimation when heterogeneity is present.

Most recently, new methods, including maximum likelihood, profile likelihood, and restricted maximum likelihood or the nonparametric “permutations” methods, have been proposed for improved estimation of variance (τ) [31, 35, 36]. The nonparametric bootstrap of the DL estimator was shown to be a better performer in small meta-analyses that were falsely assumed to be homogenous under the standard DL model [31]. Although this nonparametric bootstrap of the DL model has now been extended for both the MH and Peto models, little is known about the performances of these methods in meta-analyses involving rare events when heterogeneity is an issue.

Limitations

This study utilizes data from the Department of Defense TRICARE system, which primarily serves military personnel, veterans, and their families. We acknowledge that this population may have unique characteristics that could affect the generalizability of the findings to the broader U.S. population [37]. TRICARE beneficiaries may have different healthcare access patterns, comorbidity profiles, and treatment preferences compared to civilians [38]. For instance, active-duty personnel might have better overall health due to physical fitness requirements, while veterans may have higher rates of certain conditions related to military service [39]. Additionally, TRICARE’s structured healthcare system and coverage policies may influence treatment choices and outcomes in ways that differ from other insurance plans [39].

This study also has several limitations related to the use of administrative data sets and retrospective analysis. Although retrospective studies are an important tool to study rare diseases, manifestations, and outcomes, their design is subject to limitations [40]. Since the analysis was done on the review of claims data that were not originally designed for research, some information is bound to be missing. Selection, recall, and loss of follow-up biases may affect how representative the data is for the rare event of interest.

Using an administrative database has many strengths as it includes a large population/base sample size, which provides an established denominator [41]. The data include patient demographics, clinical characteristics, detailed healthcare use, and cost information allowing for identification and comparison of treatments and outcomes across populations included in the data [41]. However, some limitations warrant mentioning. First, as with most claims-based data sources, there is a time lag between an individual’s receipt of services and when the files become available for research (average, 2–3 years) [41]. Thus, the data may not be generalizable to the entire population, as some information may be missed in processing or reimbursement. Also, not all health data are captured in the claims. Although diagnoses are included, information such as health-related behaviors, anthropomorphic data, and nonprescription medication use that may be found in medical records are not captured in the claims. Further, claims for which services were recommended but not yet received would not be captured in the data set. Additionally, administrative claims data lack information about the decision-making process (e.g., who made the decisions, how or why the decisions were made, the correlation between planned and received treatment, why treatment was altered or discontinued) and other patient-reported outcomes [41].

We recognize the potential for overfitting in our model given the limited number of rare-event cases (14 IVIg patients). To address this concern, we have included confidence around regression (see Table 2). Additionally, we acknowledge that the small sample size may limit the generalizability of our results. In future analyses, one can plan to explore regularization techniques such as ridge or LASSO regression to mitigate overfitting and improve model performance. These methods can help reduce model complexity and potentially enhance the robustness of our predictions, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or limited sample sizes.",https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/journal/12874,N,0.0,2025-04-26 09:56:44.393094

CHAMPVA is the finest healthcare that the VA offers, and it’s particularly exceptional as a co-insurance, but it doesn’t cover the veteran unless both spouses are rated P&T.
You will pay a bit more than with Tricare Prime, but you have more freedom and ease of seeing specialists.","I don’t understand this logic. What do you mean “just separating to get CHAMPVA”? CHAMPVA is for your dependents, the vet has to be rated 100% P&T for the dependents to be eligible for CHAMPVA. That’s a lot of “ifs” up against Tricare eligibility just by retiring. Are you trying to ask about Tricare vs. VA healthcare for the vet? Or Tricare vs. CHAMPVA for dependents?

I submit that Tricare is better because it covers the veteran. CHAMPVA is the finest healthcare that the VA offers, and it’s particularly exceptional as a co-insurance, but it doesn’t cover the veteran unless both spouses are rated P&T.

ChampVa out of pocket max is 3k for the year. If you qualify for tricare you can not have ChampVa.

Use Tricare, the VA is a joke. The VA employees on here will disagree. As someone who has used both, If I could talk to myself before separating I would not have wasted my time with the VA. Just being honest.

Husband and I have Tricare Select and we love it. It's a PPO plan which means you go anywhere you want and do not need a referral. You will pay a bit more than with Tricare Prime, but you have more freedom and ease of seeing specialists. If shit hits the fan healthwise, you want a PPO plan. If you want the cheapest thing, Tricare Prime is better.",,N,0.0,2025-04-26 06:56:20.990479

It’s a day to safely dispose of unwanted, expired, or excess medications. But it’s also important to know that military pharmacies offer ways to safely dispose of drugs all year long through the Military Health System Drug Take Back program.

“National Drug Take Back Day promotes a healthier community by helping to prevent accidental misuse of expired or unused drugs,” said U.S. Army Maj. Danielle Zsido, Direct Care Branch Deputy Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the Defense Health Agency. “It also helps protect the environment by reducing the chemicals that can enter our water system.”

Keep reading to learn more about why—and how—you should dispose of expired or unused drugs.

Why you should dispose of old prescriptions

Keeping expired or unused prescriptions at home can be risky. Children might find them, or someone might misuse them. Disposing of old prescriptions from home helps prevent potential harm and medication misuse.

Additionally, throwing drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet can harm our water supply and soil. When you dispose of drugs properly, you:

Keep children safe from accidental poisoning

Help prevent potential drug misuse

Protect your environment

Help keep your community safe

How military pharmacies help

Per Drug Enforcement Administration rules, pharmacists and other pharmacy staff can’t physically accept patients’ drugs for disposal. This is why you must physically put the drugs in the collection bin or envelope yourself, though the pharmacy is happy to provide you with the drug disposal receptacle. Every military pharmacy offers at least one way to dispose of drugs:

Secure blue drop boxes where you can leave unused drugs

Secure mail-in envelopes you can take home

The process is simple. Before you drop them off, just remove or black out your personal information on the labels.

What you can drop off

You can dispose of most drugs, including:

Prescription drugs

Over-the-counter drugs

Vitamins and supplements

Pet medications

Controlled substance prescription drugs

Note: You can’t dispose of more than four ounces of liquid drugs. You also can’t dispose needles, aerosol cans, or illegal drugs. If you aren’t sure whether you can drop off a certain item, check the list of items that your pharmacy will accept.

How to get rid of your expired or unused medications

Follow these simple steps:

Find your military pharmacy by visiting Find a Military Hospital or Clinic or calling directly.

Ask if they have a drop box or secure mail-in envelopes.

Remove personal information from prescription containers.

Drop off drugs during regular pharmacy hours.

Can’t get to a military pharmacy? The DEA has other drop-off sites on April 26. Check the DEA website to find one near you.

If you can’t get to a drop-off site and must dispose of drugs at home, follow these steps:

Remove drugs from original containers.

Mix with an undesirable substance like coffee grounds or cat litter.

Put the mixture in a sealable container.

Remove personal information from empty containers.

Place the sealed container in the trash.

It ripples through families, communities, and generations, making its impact especially profound for military families who already face unique challenges. According to recent studies, nearly 1 in 10 veterans struggle with substance use disorders. Mental health conditions like PTSD often go hand in hand with addiction. These numbers underscore why accessible, effective treatment is vital.

At Westwind Recovery® in Los Angeles, we understand the importance of addressing both addiction and mental health through personalized programs, including outpatient care and intensive options. For military families, TRICARE insurance can be a crucial lifeline, helping to reduce the financial burden of rehab while ensuring you or your loved one receives the care they deserve. By understanding TRICARE rehab services, you can take the first step toward lasting recovery and brighter futures for your family.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a healthcare program designed for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. It provides various plans that cover medical services, preventive care, and mental health support. The program ensures comprehensive healthcare for those serving in the military and their dependents, emphasizing the importance of mental wellness. It offers resources for counseling and therapy, which are crucial for service members transitioning back to civilian life or coping with military service stresses.

Eligibility for TRICARE

Eligibility for TRICARE extends to active duty service members, retired service members, and their families, including certain National Guard and Reserve members and survivors of deceased service members. Understanding eligibility via insurance is vital for military families seeking rehabilitation services. TRICARE also covers special populations, including those with disabilities, ensuring all service members and their families have access to necessary care, reflecting the program’s commitment to their health and well-being.

Types of TRICARE Plans

TRICARE offers several plans to meet the diverse needs of military families, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Each plan has distinct features, including network requirements and cost-sharing structures. Families should evaluate their options to choose the plan that best suits their needs.

For instance, TRICARE Prime requires a primary care manager, facilitating coordinated care. TRICARE Select offers flexibility in choosing healthcare providers, which is beneficial for those in remote areas. Understanding each plan’s nuances empowers military families to make informed healthcare decisions.

Understanding Addiction Treatment Services

Engaging in addiction treatment not only aids in physical recovery, but also plays a significant role in emotional and psychological healing, restoring confidence and independence. Addiction treatment services through TRICARE encompass various therapies aimed at helping individuals recover from substance abuse. These services can include detox, outpatient programs, intensive outpatient programs (IOP), and partial hospitalization programs (PHP). For military families, accessing these services through TRICARE is crucial for recovery and overall well-being.

Many expectant and new military mothers are not being screened sufficiently for mental health by their providers, according to a new report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

The nation’s primary federal watchdog agency stated in the report that the lack of such care could exacerbate problems that arise during pregnancy and childbirth, to include mental health issues that could be exacerbated by deployment.

The report stated that roughly half of all service members covered under TRICARE, the military’s managed-care program, got the recommended health-care screenings when giving birth in military treatment facilities.

Incidence of such screenings in non-military facilities was much lower, GAO reported, noting that the Defense Department does not monitor these screenings.

“GAO estimates that 52 percent of the 6,151 service members who delivered through direct care in fiscal year 2022 [Oct. 1, 2021-Sept. 30, 2022] received the Defense Health Agency’s three recommended perinatal mental health screenings,” the report stated. “These screenings used on of two DHA-recommended tools and were performed at DHA’s specified time intervals. All service members were screened at least once during their perinatal period.”

In the private sector, however, screenings were less likely to occur. One contractor, the report stated, found that 30 percent were screened at least one time. Only 6 percent were screened more than once.

The report noted that while DHA recognizes screening as the main strategy for protecting this high-risk group of patients, the agency neither monitors nor directs its contractors to monitor how frequently it takes place.

“By routinely monitoring the frequency of screenings in direct or private sector care, and taking corrective actions as needed to ensure adherence to DHA’s recommendations and evidence-based practices, DHA can help ensure that beneficiaries receive high-quality care,” GAO concluded.

We received a bill from a lab (that part is legit), that says it was (supposedly) sent to TriCare-East, which denied the claim. The first problem is that it should have gone to TriCare-West.

When called about it, they said it was too late to resubmit, because the date of service was more than 90 days in the past. This is flat out wrong, but the phone rep refused to resubmit to TeiCare-West and just said we needed to pay the bill.

We called back to speak to another rep, asking that the claim be reprocessed with TriCare-West, and this rep said that the error was a birthdate mismatch and we needed to fix the information with TriCare. When I pointed out that there has never been a birthdate problem in the nearly 20 years that patient has been on TriCare Reserve Select, and that all the other claims from that date of service process without any troubles, they then claimed that the problem was that they were given my DoD Benefits ID, and not my dependent’s.

I said that was impossible because the dependent doesn’t have my CAC, was six states away, and handled everything on their own. I then said, “Let’s just call TriCare and straighten this out.” They refused stating they don’t have the time to make the call.

I pointed out again that we’ve literally had TriCare Reserve Select from the first month we could apply for it and have never had a provider need anything more than the TriCare card and again asked to get TriCare on the line to straighten it out. They then said they couldn’t process the claim w/o a copy of the dependent’s Military ID, front & back. I repeated that no provider has ever needed copies of the dependent’s Military ID, and that the other providers from that date of service, processed the claims correctly, with the exact same information they had.

The rep then repeated they couldn’t process the claim without a copy of the Military ID, they don’t have time for this and hung-up.

We literally have never had to provide anything other than the TriCare card. Are they confusing Reserve Select requirements with another TriCare flavor? Have we just been lucky?

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKIs) are a major cause of morbidity and lost duty time for military service members, impacting overall military readiness, with overuse injuries being particularly prevalent among them. Musculotendinous injuries, affecting the musculotendinous unit, are especially problematic due to their long recovery times and limited treatment options. To better understand these injuries, this review delves into the developmental, homeostatic, and structural biology of musculotendinous units, with a focus on the myotendinous junction (MTJ). Additionally, it explores the biomechanical model of the musculotendinous unit and the complexities of endogenous repair processes for muscle, tendon, and MTJ injuries. Based on these insights, the review discusses promising therapeutic approaches for treating these injuries, such as anabolic agents, metabolic reprogramming, scaffold or cell-based therapies, and physical therapy. These emerging therapies offer potential avenues for accelerating endogenous healing, reducing recovery time, and improving long-term outcomes for musculotendinous injuries.

Womack Army Medical Center proudly marks its seventh consecutive year as the leading facility in Single-Use Device reprocessing within the Department of Defense/Defense Health Agency and celebrates a decade of receiving the Stryker Sustainability Solutions Environmental Excellence Healthy Hospital Award.

Brandy Mitchell, Directorate of Logistics Clinical Analyst and SUD Reprocessing Manager at Womack, said the ‘green curve’ at Womack continues its trajectory upward. “Womack is honored to be recognized for our outstanding efforts in reprocessing single-use medical devices,” she noted. “This recognition highlights WAMC's commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, which has resulted in significant cost savings and waste reduction.”

In 2024, the facility achieved significant cost savings of $933,023 including $896,123 through collaboration with Stryker Sustainability and an additional $36,900 via Cardinal Health reprocessing—while diverting more than 51,000 devices, which translates to almost 15,000 pounds of waste from local landfills.

“The dedication of leadership at all levels across our Womack departments and clinics plays a vital role in the successful implementation and sustainability of the reprocessing program,” said Col. Stephanie Mont, Commander of Womack Army Medical Center. “Their continued emphasis enables our team to maximize our resources and reduce waste.”

Since the inception of the Reprocessing Program in 2008, Womack has saved $9 million and successfully reduced over 140,000 pounds of medical waste. The innovation of reprocessed medical devices has become a hallmark of healthcare efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Reusing SUDs not only mitigates waste but also strengthens the supply chain by retaining resources locally, thereby reducing reliance on imported products and the materials required for their production.

Lt. Col. Cynthia Styner, Logistics Registered Nurse Liaison at Womack, said the operating rooms at Womack have a strong history of sustainability excellence. “Partnered with Stryker, numerous devices such as sequential compression device sleeves, pulse oximeter sensors, electrode leads and cables, trocars, harmonics, ligasures, tourniquet cuffs and ultrasonic scalpels are recycled and redesigned, aligning with the overall impact of cost savings and waste diverted from landfills,” she said.

Womack has even purchased a device used for soft tissue incisions when bleeding control and minimal thermal injury are desired. The instrument can be used as a substitute for electrosurgery, lasers, and steel scalpels. By the Operating Room purchasing one reprocessed handpiece device, it minimized carbon dioxide emissions by 889.29 kg. This reduction is comparable to the emissions from traveling over 1,000 miles, consuming 45 gallons of gasoline, charging 50,000 smartphones, or reducing a hospital stay by nine days in an acute care unit or three days in the ICU, as well as switching 15 incandescent bulbs to LED.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8989558.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-25 10:56:24.170163
