DGMC leaders emphasized the importance of joint training initiatives, which include training medics, nurses and trauma teams alongside civilian partners, recognizing this integrated approach will be essential in future conflicts, while also enhancing vital medical skills for high-quality patient care at home.

They also showcased ongoing efforts to bolster workforce resilience through clinical training, expanded readiness rotations, and robust academic affiliations. These initiatives aim to ensure the medical force remains adaptable and prepared for emerging challenges.

During a town hall at DGMC and throughout his visit, Ferrara expressed his deep appreciation for the staff's commitment, professionalism, and ongoing impact on military medicine. He also emphasized the vital role Travis AFB plays in developing a resilient and ready medical force, capable of responding globally with speed and efficiency.

“I deeply value these visits because they provide an opportunity to see firsthand the incredible work being done and the unique capabilities that drive our mission forward,” Ferrara said. “Most importantly, I want to thank our medical professionals at Travis for their unwavering dedication to caring for patients, pursuing excellence, and training the next generation of medical professionals who will carry this mission into the future.”

The visit reaffirmed the DOD’s focus on ensuring the MHS remains a cornerstone of military readiness, with Travis AFB and DGMC at the forefront for the delivery of world-class medical care and operational support.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9110749/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-18 17:56:18.717191

When someone thinks about what people use their insurance for, they often think about things like broken bones, long-term illnesses, and cardiac events. However, there are other complex conditions a person can use their Tricare insurance to get help for that they may not know about.

Substance use disorders cause physical and psychological damage to people who suffer from them. The disorders can be overcome when a person attends a licensed professional treatment program that treats people who have an addiction to alcohol or drugs. For this reason, Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California is available to those who need help finding a way to heal from their dependence on substances.

About Tricare Insurance

Tricare is an insurance company that provides comprehensive coverage for military personnel, retirees, and their families. Approximately 9 million

customers use Tricare insurance when visiting physicians, nurses, physician’s assistants, clinics, hospitals, and behavioral healthcare clinicians. Tricare offers health plans, special programs, prescriptions, and dental plans, and most of their plans meet the requirements for coverage provided under the Affordable Care Act.

What Types of Rehab Programs in California Does Tricare Cover?

Tricare is in-network with Bright Future, which means several types of rehab programs can be accessed to help people in all stages of recovery enroll in the right treatment plan for their specific needs. Upon acceptance to a program, each person will receive an assessment to determine which level of care is right for them.

Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California can be used when attending the following types of programs:

Detox:This is the beginning step in treatment for people who have substance use disorders. A detox program usually takes seven to ten days.

Residential:After attending detox, a residential program provides the multi-disciplinary treatment a person needs to continue the work begun during detoxification. Residential programs typically run from 30 to 90 days.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP): PHP requires the person to travel to a facility for their treatment sessions and then return home. Appointments take place for several hours per day on weekdays.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):IOP requires attendance for several hours each week, which gives people time to commit to personal and professional obligations.

Does Tricare Cover Detox?

Tricare covers detoxification programs because they provide people with the structured and nurturing care they need as they navigate the first several days of their recovery.

Does Tricare Cover Residential Rehab?

Once a person completes detox, they can use their coverage to enroll in a residential rehab. They will live in a comfortable facility so they can have round-the-clock care that helps them manage their withdrawal symptoms.

Does Tricare Cover Outpatient Treatment?

Outpatient treatment includes two levels of care. They both match the individual with life-saving therapy modalities, with the only difference being how many hours per week they attend appointments.

Does Tricare Cover Therapy?

Attending therapy provides people who struggle with substance use disorders with the ability to learn how to identify and disarm their triggers to drink or use drugs.

For beneficiaries in Bandera, Bexar, Burnet, Caldwell, Coke, Comal, Concho, Gillespie, Guadalupe, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Reeves, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson counties, the date has been extended from July 17 to July 27.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy. As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

I’m adhering to my military branch’s instructions on keeping physically fit and eating nutritiously, but I’m having trouble getting rid of some excess pounds from my last duty station, where I mostly sat at a desk. How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way?

Sincerely,

U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon

--

To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you’ll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

--

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you're doing vigorous exercise where you're getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you're still moving quite a bit, and that's a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it's also important to recognize that it's fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don't achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

""Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,"" Franzos noted. ""Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.""

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It's just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We've taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzos said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they're going to reinforce that, and they're going to want you to prove to them that you've taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

--

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

For more information, check out these resources, and remember, stay safe out there. We want you and your teammates to stay fit and in fighting shape.

Are you in one of these groups? Keep reading to learn more about the basics of using your TRICARE benefit.

Eligibility

Your uniformed service personnel office determines your TRICARE eligibility.

To check your eligibility, first make sure your information is fully updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Sponsors are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must register their eligible family members by going to a local ID card office. (Note: You should call first, or set up an appointment online, to check appointment availability.)

Then, log in to milConnect to check if you’re eligible for TRICARE. Once you’ve registered on the milConnect website, you can update your contact information in DEERS and view your TRICARE enrollment information.

Health plans

Choosing a plan

You have different TRICARE health plan options depending on your sponsor’s status, your relationship to your sponsor, your age, and where you live.

To see which plans you may be eligible for, check out the Plan Finder Tool and answer a few simple questions. Then, you can use the Compare Plans Tool to figure out which plan is right for you. (Note: Families can have split enrollment, meaning some family members can enroll in one plan, while others enroll in a different one.)

Enrolling in a plan

Once you know your plan, visit TRICARE Enrollment for steps on how to enroll or purchase a plan. These steps may differ depending on the plan you choose and where you live.

Are you a new active duty family member? Once you’re registered in DEERS, you’ll be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan based on where you live and the plan selection of your other family members who aren’t active duty service members. You have 90 days from the automatic enrollment date to change to a different plan (TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime Remote, or the US Family Health Plan, if available).

Changing plans

Interested in switching your TRICARE plan? You may have the opportunity to do so during the annual TRICARE Open Season in the fall each year. Changes you make during open season will take effect Jan. 1 of the following year.

You may also be able to change your plan when you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. QLEs are certain life changes that open a 90-day window for you and your family members to make eligible enrollment changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.

Common QLEs include, but aren’t limited to:

Marriage, divorce, or annulment

Birth or adoption of a child (or placement of a child by a court in a member’s home)

Moving

Activation or deactivation

Retirement or separation

Losing or gaining other health insurance

If you experience a QLE, make sure to update DEERS right away.

Getting care

Regions

TRICARE is available worldwide, and your benefits are the same no matter where you live. But different regional contractors help deliver the benefit around the world. If you get civilian health care, this means you’ll reach out to different customer service contacts depending on where you live.

There are two TRICARE regions in the U.S.:

East Region

West Region

And there is one Overseas Region.

To learn which region you’re in, visit Regions.

Military hospitals and clinics

The DHA operates military hospitals and clinics. You may be able to seek care there, depending on where you are, what plan you have, and your beneficiary group.

Civilian network

You can also seek care from a civilian network of TRICARE-authorized providers. This network depends on your region.

To search for a network provider, use the Find a Doctor Tool to get you to the right provider directory.

Note: You may be able to see a non-network TRICARE-authorized provider, depending on your TRICARE plan. But you may have higher out-of-pocket costs, and you may have to file your own claims.

ID cards

For most beneficiaries, you’ll need to show your Uniformed Services ID card to your provider as proof of TRICARE coverage. If you’re an active duty service member, you’ll need to show your Common Access Card.

Coverage

TRICARE covers treatments, procedures, prescription drugs, or devices that are medically necessary and considered proven. Learn more about how a service becomes a TRICARE-covered benefit.

You can use the Covered Services Tool to see if a service is covered by TRICARE or not. You can search by keyword or browse common categories.

Pharmacy, dental, and vision coverage

TRICARE offers prescription drug coverage and several options for filling your prescriptions. You have the same prescription coverage with almost any TRICARE health plan. (Note: If you’re enrolled in USFHP, you have separate pharmacy coverage.)

To check if your prescription drugs are covered, use the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE’s medical coverage. Depending on your beneficiary group, you may get dental care through:

Military dental clinics

Active Duty Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program

Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage, including eye exams, depends on:

Who you are

Your TRICARE plan

Your age

Costs

Each TRICARE plan has different costs for care and coverage. See TRICARE Costs to view and compare costs for covered services, enrollment fees, and plan premiums.

Do you have more questions about plan options, enrollment, or getting care? Contact your regional contractor or visit www.tricare.mil for more information. Welcome to TRICARE!",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/getting-started-with-TRICARE.png,N,0.0,2025-07-18 11:56:29.269257

Who Is the Health Insurance Provider, TRICARE?

TRICARE is the health insurance program operated by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of its Military Health System. The official brand dates to the mid-1990s. However, its origins can be traced to the 1966 establishment of CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services), as the government expanded care to military retirees and dependents.

Launched in its current form between 1995 and 1997, TRICARE offers a comprehensive suite of health plans to diverse groups, including active-duty service members, military families, retirees, National Guard/Reserve members, young adults, and Medal of Honor recipients. Key plans include TRICARE Prime (HMO‑style), TRICARE Select (PPO style), TRICARE for Life (Medicare wrap‑around), Reserve Select/Retired plans, and Young Adult coverage. Specialty services can include pharmacy, mental health, dental, ECHO for dependents with special needs, and overseas care, demonstrating a role as the civilian-care arm of military healthcare.

What Is TRICARE Health’s Online Treatment Coverage?

TRICARE online mental health coverage in Texas is provided through its telemedicine benefit, offering real-time Video conferencing therapy and audio-only care. Your online treatment sessions for counseling, medication management, or urgent behavioral support are eligible for reimbursement when delivered by TRICARE-authorized providers in your region. Services use secure, HIPAA-compliant platforms that connect you with licensed professionals throughout Texas.

Routine outpatient therapy and more structured programs are typically covered but may require prior authorization before beginning treatment. TRICARE Select and Prime similarly support teletherapy visits and virtual counseling, ensuring continuity of care even when in-person options are limited. This growing modality broadens access, reduces wait times, and maintains quality of care, especially when you live in remote areas of the state or have travel restrictions.

Does TRICARE Insurance Cover Virtual Mental Health Therapy in Texas?

TRICARE does cover virtual mental health in Texas, including counseling, psychiatry, medication management, and crisis support over secure telehealth counseling platforms. Therapy and psychiatric appointments may be delivered through video or audio-only calls, with TRICARE-authorized providers eligible for reimbursement without a separate benefit. You may not need a referral or prior authorization for standard outpatient digital mental health services.

However, it is important to verify your coverage before beginning treatment, so you do not receive a surprise medical bill. Remote psychotherapy sessions use HIPAA-compliant platforms, ensuring confidentiality and quality care. Prior authorization is required if your provider determines virtual intensive programs are medically necessary. You can confidently use your TRICARE benefits for virtual mental health services in Texas, whether for weekly talk therapy or medication support.

Does TRICARE Health Insurance Cover Virtual Dual Diagnosis Therapy for Texas Young Adults?

TRICARE does cover virtual mental health therapy for dual diagnosis in young adults, addressing mental health and substance use disorders in an integrated and coordinated manner. TRICARE’s telehealth benefit includes online individual and group psychotherapy, family counseling, medication management, and crisis support for co‑occurring conditions when delivered by authorized providers over secure video or audio platforms.

Young adults enrolled in TRICARE Prime, Select, or the TRICARE Young Adult program can remotely access this support, provided services are medically necessary. Routine virtual visits may not require prior authorization, though more intensive outpatient care does. This means you can receive online psychiatric help for mental health conditions and substance use disorders without leaving home, ensuring seamless care tailored to your needs, and expanding your path to recovery.

Which Online Treatment Programs Are Covered by TRICARE Insurance in Texas

TRICARE’s telehealth coverage in Texas supports a range of online treatment programs to improve mental well-being through structured therapy, group support, medication management, and crisis intervention.

Online IOP Covered by TRICARE

Online PHP Covered by TRICARE

Online Outpatient Programs Covered by TRICARE

Online IOP Covered by TRICARE

An online Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) is a structured, clinically supervised treatment plan when you need more support than weekly therapy but don’t require inpatient care. Virtual IOPs offer multiple sessions per week, using sessions conducted through secure video platforms. This flexible approach allows you to receive comprehensive mental health care while maintaining your daily responsibilities.

TRICARE provides coverage for web-based mental health support that includes IOP services when they are medically necessary and delivered by TRICARE network providers.

A virtual Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) is an intensive treatment option when you need daily therapeutic support but do not require hospitalization.

Depending on your TRICARE plan, you may qualify for coverage, though prior authorization is typically required. Coverage details may vary based on your location and provider, so it’s important to verify benefits. You can do this quickly and easily by calling BreakThrough by BasePoint.

Online Outpatient Programs Covered by TRICARE

An online outpatient program is a flexible, virtual mental healthcare format when you need regular mental health support without requiring daily intensive sessions. Delivered through secure video or audio, cybertherapy typically includes weekly counseling and medication check-ins. This model allows you to stay connected with your provider, applying new coping strategies and maintaining your routines while focusing on recovery.

TRICARE covers online outpatient programs when delivered by TRICARE-authorized providers and are medically necessary.

How to Get TRICARE Health Insurance to Pay for Online Mental Health Treatment

To get TRICARE to cover your virtual mental health services, confirm your eligibility, understand your plan benefits, and ensure you’re working with a TRICARE-authorized provider. Depending on your plan, you may need a referral or prior authorization, especially for intensive services like IOP or PHP. At BasePoint, we take care of this process for you.

It’s helpful to understand the key insurance terms in your benefits. For example, the underwriting process assesses the company’s risk and liability associated with insuring you. An actuary uses this information to calculate the probability of loss, which determines your premium. A policy may include exclusions to limit your coverage or an umbrella policy to offer wrap-around services, such as in TRICARE for Life, which supplements Medicare. Once a claim is submitted, the information is evaluated by an insurance adjuster to determine the appropriate settlement. Call us today at 972-325-2633, and we’ll handle the paperwork and coordination so you can focus on getting better.

How Many Times Will TRICARE Insurance Pay for Virtual Mental Health Therapy in Texas?

Unlike most private insurance companies, TRICARE does not impose a strict cap on the number of digital therapy sessions you can receive in Texas, as long as the services are medically necessary and delivered by a TRICARE network provider. However, there are some important guidelines. You can receive unlimited sessions when your provider can document medical necessity.

Depending on the level of care, you may need prior authorization before receiving treatment to demonstrate medical necessity and confirm care from an in-network provider. Prior authorization is typically granted in 30- to 90-day blocks of time. This ensures flexibility for your online treatment, which maintains an appropriate level of oversight for ongoing care. We understand that taking the first step towards receiving treatment can feel overwhelming, which is why we handle most of the administrative burden for you, allowing you to focus solely on your treatment.

Data show that online mental wellness can help reduce the stigma attached to mental health, may help those with limited mobility, and is compatible with public health guidelines during highly infectious seasons.

Respondents were more likely to say that mental health telehealth offers the same quality, and younger adults were more likely to use it than older adults.

Online therapy allows you to receive mental health care in the privacy of your home and access providers on a flexible schedule. However, therapy sessions can be impacted by unstable internet connections and may not be comfortable for people who need help with in-person communication skills.

A 2023 review of 24 studies revealed virtual interventions had higher odds of remission and lower posttreatment symptom severity in people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for treatment.

A 2022 study demonstrated that virtual group therapy was equally effective and safe as in-person therapy and had the same attendance level with improved accessibility and acceptability.

Study data in 2020 showed telemental health group therapy sessions were a viable alternative to in-person groups when facilitators take additional steps to build group cohesion.",https://basepointbreakthrough.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/therapy-session-mental-health.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-18 07:48:27.596553

Santa Cruz is facing a lawsuit from the American Beverage Association and allied industry groups over its newly enacted soda tax, escalating a legal fight that could have far-reaching implications for local public health policy in California.

Approved by voters in the November 2024 election, Measure Z imposes a 2-cent-per-ounce tax on distributors of sugar-sweetened beverages. Public health advocates have championed this and other similar taxes as a way to reduce consumption of sugary drinks—a leading contributor to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and dental decay.

The lawsuit, filed May 28, 2025, argues that the tax violates the Keep Groceries Affordable Act of 2018, which prohibits California cities and counties from creating new taxes on groceries, including beverages, through January 1, 2031. Included in the act was a penalty that would have stripped a local authority of its sales and use tax revenue should it impose a new grocery–related tax or fee.

However, in 2023, the California Third District Court of Appeals invalidated the financial penalties that once enforced the moratorium, allowing Santa Cruz to move forward with the tax without fear of financial repercussions.

CMA’s long-standing advocacy on sugary beverages

The California Medical Association (CMA) has long supported evidence-based public policies aimed at reducing the health harms associated with sugar-sweetened beverages. Through legislative advocacy and public health partnerships, CMA has backed proposals to impose excise taxes, restrict marketing to children and mandate clear labeling of sugary drinks.

While CMA is not directly involved in the Santa Cruz lawsuit, the association is closely monitoring the case for its potential implications on broader public health policy. CMA policy recognizes the urgent need to reduce consumption of sugary drinks as part of a larger strategy to combat preventable chronic diseases.

,,2025-07-18 05:41:45+00:00,Kaiserslautern American,"Cancer survivor, soldier, athlete praises military health system healthcare team, 'My Coaches'",Nate Cairney,,,,,https://www.kaiserslauternamerican.com/cancer-survivor-soldier-athlete-praises-military-health-system-healthcare-team-my-coaches/,"1st Class David Hong attributes his success to “a real team”—though, he’s not talking about his fellow athletes on Team Army.
“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I’ve been working with very closely, now,” Hong said.
He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.
That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games.
Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover.","As he trains for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games in July, U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class David Hong attributes his success to “a real team”—though, he’s not talking about his fellow athletes on Team Army.

“I’ve had a team of people that went through my journey, from the platoon sergeants, the squad leaders, my nurse case manager … they’ve participated in my ‘scrimmages,’ my meetings and appointments,” he said.

The team captain: His primary care physician at the time, Paul Haufe, a physician assistant at Evans Army Community Hospital at Fort Carson, Colorado, who encouraged Hong to get a routine colonoscopy at age 50.

“He initiated all of this,” said Hong. “He was always there for me from the get-go, even behind the scenes.”

When Hong received a lifechanging diagnosis, stage 4 colon cancer, his doctor urgently formed a comprehensive care team to start treatment: Specialists, nurses, and other dedicated personnel within the Military Health System.

“They were my coaches, they pushed me,” Hong said.

A cancer diagnosis, a path to recovery

When Hong was due for his first routine colonoscopy in July 2022, his primary care physician “didn’t give me a choice,” he said.

“It was the second time my PCP recommended that I get the screening done. I actually refused to do it because I was busy,” Hong said. “He was going to talk to my command to make sure that I went through with that referral to do the colonoscopy … so I went.”

Besides, he said, he felt fine.

The screening caught a cancerous blockage in his colon, which Hong credits the preventive screening with saving his life.

“These types of cancers, people are getting younger and getting them—they are preventable,” he said. At Hong’s encouragement, twelve chaplains he worked with scheduled their colonoscopies.

He was immediately connected to the gastrointestinal specialist, surgical team, and nurses within Evans.

“It was right at the hospital, and with their capabilities—they were able to have all the resources there to do the cancer removal there the following week,” Hong said.

He had part of his colon removed, but the cancer spread to his lymph nodes. The following month, he started chemotherapy at CommonSpirit Penrose Cancer Center in Colorado Springs through the TRICARE health plan network, which gives access to a wide range of healthcare services by TRICARE-authorized providers—offering streamlined access and reduced costs to nonmilitary hospitals and clinics.

“It was a combination of treatments” through both hospitals, he said, that started his recovery journey.

“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I’ve been working with very closely, now,” Hong said. He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.

Hong went through a total of 23 treatments of chemotherapy and had several surgeries to remove the cancer, as well as part of his liver and stomach lining. He kept up with treatment and appointments through Maria Schuch, the nurse case manager assigned to the Fort Carson Soldier Recovery Unit—a support system that he credits with a proactive approach to his care.

“Right from the beginning, she was really engaged, and she knew what she needed to provide. She was on top of all my referrals. It really was teamwork,” he said. “Get connected with a nurse case manager. They aren’t there to babysit you, and they make sure all your records are updated.”

While he recovered, he found adaptive sports therapy through the Soldier Recovery Unit, a program within the Army Recovery Care Program at Fort Carson, Colorado, and participated in archery, cycling, and field events. That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games. While at the trials, he was awarded “Heart of the Team” from his fellow athletes.

Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover. “They’re all excellent in their own way. They’ve been providing the same care, very professional and on top of things,” he said. “It’s a blessing.”

Service rooted in faith, recovery in adaptive care

Hong, a religious affairs specialist who joined the U.S. Army as a chaplain’s assistant, knows from both perspectives that seeking help is a sign of strength. Chaplains, he learned, are often the first line of defense when service members may be struggling.

“We screen soldiers that may have issues, and we try to link them up with the right resources,” he said. “We try to work very closely with behavioral health, because I think our culture in the military, any branch, if you show any type of weakness—especially mentally—people may get scared or afraid, you know, because they don’t know that resources are out there.”

As one who sought mental health support himself, he encourages anyone to talk to a chaplain for support.

“I think as religious affairs and chaplains, we bring a different perspective. We can introduce you to a resource that might work for you,” he said. “It’s always the safety of the individual that is important. We try to give them all the resources necessary, especially with mental health.”

Backed by team on the way to the games

On the sidelines are Hong’s cheerleaders: his wife, Monica, and family who has been his support throughout all of his health challenges.

“Going to cancer treatment with my wife, having her there next to me, having my sister, going through my treatment— there are days that I didn’t want to do it,” he said. “My children are everything.”

He also credits his military leadership and fellow chaplains for being there for him.

“They were there to sacrifice their time and then all the phone calls that (I made) whenever I needed to talk to somebody like the chaplains, friends, even the leadership, they were there checking up on me. I think that’s so important.”

Hong is also finding strength through his fellow wounded warriors, as they shared stories of recovery and resilience leading up to the Warrior Games.

“When I went to the Army trials, I heard everybody’s different story. And I was like, ‘wow, I want to be part of this,’” he said. “I was seeking a community. It’s so therapeutical and so good for you to be part of a mission.”

Hong is still receiving care, and he feels like he’s in good hands through continued monitoring and checkups: “It’s all hands on deck and they’re doing all of the things they should be doing.” It’s because of his healthcare team, he said, that he can still serve in the U.S. Army.

“It’s harder because I’m not able to do the job that I want to do because of my health, and it took time for me to process, but I’m still here,” he said. “Maybe (serving) can be a different, in the way of helping soldiers and their families and the veterans—a different kind of position, maybe part of a plan to give strength to others who might be going through something similar.”

While at the games in Colorado Springs, he plans to pay homage to a particular healthcare team member while competing: Schuch, his nurse case manager at the SRU.

“My manager’s mom passed away, and she’s from Ireland. So, I’m going to put the Irish flag on my bike and dedicate it for her mom.”

For Hong, his participation at Warrior Games is much bigger than winning. It’s all part of being a team.

“Obviously we want to win because we’re competitive, but we also want to win in every way, shape in life,” he said. “I didn’t get here on my own. I did put in the work, but if you can’t find that fire in yourself, you’ll find people around you that will help you get there.”

I've had SSDI for two years although I started receiving benefits a year ago.

About a month ago I received a Medicare card (I'm 63, 64 in October) and literature about it.

Apparently if you are on SSDI they auto sign you up roughly 24 months after receiving the benefit.

Here's the deal. I'm 100 service connected through the VA and use the VA solely. The wife retired early and is utilizing Tricare Select as her health insurance. This would allow me to use it as well if we are traveling and there is no VA close by.

The law states that when I am eligible for Medicare I have to sign up or we lose tricare benefits.

I'm sure most people welcome Medicare because they can utilize the benefits. The issue is I don't want to start paying yet if I am not 65, especially since I have comprehensive care already.

Tricare doesn't know... After talking to 3 people.

CMA has opined that any savings from reducing the hospital facility fee should be reinvested in the Medicare fee schedule for all physician practices.
Overall, the proposed fee schedule falls far short of addressing physician payments that have declined by 33% (adjusted for inflation) since 2001.","July 17, 2025

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) this week released the proposed 2026 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and Quality Payment Program rule. Most physicians would see an average 3.6% conversion factor increase, while qualifying Alternative Payment Model (APM) participants would receive an average 3.83% conversion factor bump. The fee schedule also includes two additional conversion factors for anesthesia services.

The conversion factor is the multiplier used to determine Medicare reimbursement rates for physician services. The increases are due to a one-year 2.5% increase provided by Congress in HR 1, an additional 0.75% increase for APM participants and a 0.25% increase for all other physicians based on current the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) law and a 0.55% increase due to work relative value unit (RVU) changes.

But the conversion factor increase is only part of the story. CMS is also proposing structural reforms that could significantly reshape how physicians are reimbursed—including a major shift in site-of-service payments and new efficiency adjustments.

Key provisions include:

New site-of-service payment adjustments: CMS proposes increasing indirect cost payments by an average 4% for services delivered in non-facility (e.g., office-based) settings, while reducing payments by an average 7% for the same services in facility settings (i.e., outpatient hospital settings and ambulatory surgery centers). The change aims to reduce hospital consolidation and ensure payment parity across care settings. It would result in a nearly $280 billion reduction in payments to hospitals. (See the payment impact table here by specialty and site of service.)

New efficiency adjustment: CMS proposes a new -2.5% adjustment to work RVUs for all CPT codes except time-based codes (e.g., E/M visits). According to CMS, the goal is to better reflect service intensity and rebalance valuation between primary care and procedural services.

Telehealth policy updates: CMS is proposing to permanently adopt a revised definition of “direct supervision” that would allow supervising physicians to be immediately available via real-time audio/video technology. However, CMS plans to end current flexibilities that allow teaching physicians to be virtually present when billing for services involving residents after December 31, 2025—returning to pre-pandemic in-person supervision requirements. An exception would remain for rural areas. CMS did not add the telemedicine E/M office visit codes to the authorized Medicare Telehealth Services List effective for 2026.

MIPS: CMS will maintain the 75-point performance threshold to avoid a penalty for the 2026–2028 performance years/2028–2030 payment years.

ACOs: CMS is limiting Medicare Shared Savings Program accountable care organization participation in one-sided financial risk models to 5 years.

New mandatory payment model: Beginning in 2027, CMS will test a five-year model in select regions for physicians treating heart failure or low back pain, with payment adjustments of up to ±9%.

GPCI update: CMS has updated the Geographic Practice Cost Index that upon initial analysis is accurate for California.

Hospital outpatient and ASC payments: Hospital outpatient fees and ambulatory surgery center payments would increase by 2.4% in 2026.

AMA survey data: In a controversial move, CMS said it will not rely on the new AMA Physician Practice Information Survey for Medicare Economic Index weighting of practice expenses, or on AMA RVS Update Committee (RUC) survey data for RVUs. CMS cited concerns about low physician response rates, incomplete data, and evidence that physicians may overstate the time and intensity required for certain procedures—leading to overvaluation of some services. This shows CMS’ intent to transition away from the AMA RUC process.

While CMA is concerned about the negative impact of higher hospital site-of-service (facility fee) payments on independent physician practices, we will be thoroughly reviewing the impact of the proposal on the viability of all practices. CMA has opined that any savings from reducing the hospital facility fee should be reinvested in the Medicare fee schedule for all physician practices.

Overall, the proposed fee schedule falls far short of addressing physician payments that have declined by 33% (adjusted for inflation) since 2001.

“While we appreciate CMS working to stabilize primary care, Congress continues to fail to address the decades of underpayment that threaten all physician practices and patient access,” said CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “Without permanent, inflation-adjusted reforms, physicians will continue to face financial instability—and patients will pay the price by not being able to find a physician taking Medicare patients.”

CMA is reviewing the proposed rule in full and will submit comments. Stay tuned for more details.

The counties affected are Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Salem, Somerset, Sussex, Union, and Warren.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

This reality was at the heart of a recent engagement between leadership from U.S. Naval Hospital (USNH) Rota and Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, one of southern Spain’s premier public medical centers.

Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, operated under the Andalusian Health Service (Servicio Andaluz de Salud), serves as a regional hub for complex care and advanced diagnostics. For U.S. military medical planners, it represents a key node in the extended care network that supports readiness for warfighters and dependents stationed throughout southwestern Spain.

“Our presence in Europe depends on more than just facilities, it depends on trusted relationships with host-nation partners. We work within their established systems, aligning closely to integrate in a seamless, responsive way that enables us to meet our mission effectively,” said Capt. Michael Mercado, Director of USNH Rota.

The dialogue between institutions focused on interoperability: how to streamline referrals, coordinate specialty care, and ensure language and procedural alignment during both routine and emergent situations. Additionally, the teams explored opportunities for simulation exercises and shared clinical education that would benefit both systems.

Mr. Jose Luis Guijarro, Managing Director of the Puerta del Mar – San Carlos University Hospital, underscored the value of sustained, bidirectional cooperation. “Our mission is to provide essential public health, but we recognize the broader regional role we play. Working closely with USNH Rota strengthens our own preparedness and deepens our ties with the international community.”

The engagement reflects a broader Defense Health Agency (DHA) objective in building sustainable partnerships with local and allied institutions to enhance collective readiness and resilience. In an environment where medical threats do not respect borders, the ability to operate fluidly within host-nation systems is a strategic advantage.

Whether coordinating emergency response, managing complex referrals, or sharing innovations in care delivery, Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar and USNH Rota continue to model how allied cooperation in healthcare can advance both mission success and community well-being.

Strategically positioned on the Iberian Peninsula, the hospital plays a critical role in defending, restoring, and elevating the health of warfighters and their families. USNH Rota provides ready, reliable care to 8,400 service members and their families.

The myAuth system is based on a commercial product, rebranded for the Defense Department, which provides cloud-based ""identity as a service"" capabilities to the department.
The legacy DS Logon is not the only system being replaced by myAuth, though it is the largest.
Although the target for decommissioning the DS Logon is 18 months, Gill said users can log in to myAuth now and set up an account using their DS Logon credentials.
""And one of the cool features from myAuth that DS Logon did not have is the help feature.","Over the next 18 months, the Defense Department will replace the legacy DS Logon system, which authenticates users onto more than 200 DOD and Veterans Affairs websites, with a more modern and flexible system called myAuth.

The new authentication system offers a range of features that will simplify the login process for approximately 20 million individuals who use it, including military personnel, DOD civilians, military and civilian retirees, family member beneficiaries, contractors and vendors.

The myAuth system is based on a commercial product, rebranded for the Defense Department, which provides cloud-based ""identity as a service"" capabilities to the department. It is hosted on a secure DOD cloud and has been authorized by the Defense Information Systems Agency, said Zachary R. Gill, the branch chief of identity credential access management and partner services within the Defense Manpower Data Center.

Gill said one of the significant advantages of myAuth is that it provides secure access for individuals, such as retirees and beneficiaries, who may not have a common access card and cannot authenticate into a system using certificates contained within a CAC. However, the system also provides access options for individuals who have a CAC but may not be able to utilize it in certain circumstances.

For example, he presented a scenario in which a soldier or civilian employee might be traveling on orders booked through the Defense Travel System. At the airport, problems with the airline may mean the orders need to be changed, but since the traveler does not have access to a CAC-enabled computer, this poses a challenge.

""With myAuth, you would be able to provide an alternative credential, and therefore, you'd be able to access DTS from your personal cellphone and update your travel orders or make changes,"" Gill said.

He added that a CAC will no longer be the only way to access systems. Other methods, on a case-by-case basis, will provide the user with a variety of login options.

The myAuth utilizes Okta Verify, which can be installed on a personal or government-issued cellphone and will serve as a means to provide CAC-free access. The app includes biometric capabilities for both face and fingerprint recognition.

Gill said the methods of access allowed are set by the system owner, but myAuth can do it all.

""For instance, if I'm accessing DTS, the DTS application may say it needs a higher-level assurance for people to be able to access it,"" he said.

Gill described a CAC as authenticator assurance level three, the ""gold standard"" for authentication. However, lower levels of authentication could also be used if a system's administrators permit it.

Not everybody in the community who will be served by myAuth has a CAC or a smartphone, Gill said. And the things they need to access might not require the highest levels of authentication. The myAuth system will flex to meet their needs.

""In our community, we serve a lot of members that may not have access to smartphones and may not have access to technology,"" he added. The legacy DS Logon is not the only system being replaced by myAuth, though it is the largest. Gill said other systems in use throughout DOD will also be shuttered and replaced by myAuth.

""There are multiple authentication systems across the department that each department is paying for individually, which means each department is paying for sustainment costs or licensing costs,"" he said. ""myAuth will collapse those one-off systems, providing an enterprise solution.""

A key performance metric for myAuth is system availability, the assurance that the system will always be available to authenticate users into critical Defense Department systems. Gill said the target for system availability with myAuth is that it be available to serve users 99.99% of the time.

Although the target for decommissioning the DS Logon is 18 months, Gill said users can log in to myAuth now and set up an account using their DS Logon credentials. If users wait until after DS Logon is gone, he said the process to create a new account will require reverifying the user's identity if they do not have a CAC. Active-duty service members and DOD civilians with a CAC will likely have no problem transitioning to myAuth, he said, adding that their daily use of systems that currently offer both DS Logon and myAuth as authentication methods will be a reminder to sign up for an account.

However, for the significant portion of users who do not use DOD systems daily, such as retirees, family members and contractors, Gill said getting the word out is a top priority.

""We've started executing our communications plan. We've already sent out several million emails to our community to let them know,"" he said, adding that the Defense Manpower Data Center has partnered with the Defense Health Agency to let users who access related Tricare-related systems know about the switch.

Gill said the myAuth website also provides assistance.

""If you hit the myAuth page, we have a new help section,"" he said. ""And one of the cool features from myAuth that DS Logon did not have is the help feature. So, when you go to myAuth, there's a button that [is labeled] 'help.' And when you click that, it's going to break down everything about what myAuth is, how to log in, frequently asked questions and what creating a new account looks like.""

As of July 14, 2025, over 740,000 DOD-affiliated personnel have created myAuth accounts. Importantly, the success rate for self-service account creation exceeds 99%, minimizing the need for users to contact the call center.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/17/2003756074/1280/1280/0/250605-D-D0439-001.JPG,N,0.0,2025-07-17 12:56:49.923762

Covered services

You can use online visits for many types of care. These include:

• Primary care, including on-demand nonemergency care

• Preventive care

• Telemental health care

• Specialty care

• Remote monitoring for serious chronic conditions

Before you book a virtual health visit, call or visit your regional contractor’s web page. Some types of care need a referral or pre-authorization.

Do you get your care at a military hospital or clinic? Many of these virtual health services may be available there. Contact your provider for more information. If you’re an active duty service member, you need a referral and pre-authorization from your primary care manager for virtual health care.

As described in the TRICARE Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, virtual mental health services have the same referrals and pre-authorization requirements as your in-person mental health care.

Costs

Virtual health costs are similar to in-person costs. Your costs depend on who you are, health plan, and type of appointment. Note that you’ll need to pay your usual cost-shares and copayments for virtual visits.

What you need

To use virtual health services, you need:

• A computer or smartphone (for video care)

• A telephone (for telephone-only care)

• A secure phone or internet connection

• Referrals or pre-authorizations (if required)

Overseas

Do you live outside the U.S.? You can still use virtual health services if:

• The care is a TRICARE-covered benefit and is appropriate for virtual health.

• The country where you receive care allows virtual health.

• The provider is licensed and TRICARE-authorized and has a license to practice in the country where you receive care.

• The provider knows your location and how to contact help in a medical or mental health emergency.

• The provider follows all local health care and virtual health rules.

TRICARE will cover your virtual health care if you meet these requirements.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare

Do you have TRICARE For Life? Medicare usually pays first for virtual visits. This includes phone calls with your doctor. Remember to check what Medicare and TRICARE cover before scheduling an appointment. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover a service.

Autism Care Demonstration

TRICARE covers services for parents of children with autism. This includes applied behavior analysis guidance. These services are under the Autism Care Demonstration.

With more than 15 years of service at BJACH and nearly three decades in the nursing profession, Boone’s career has spanned nearly every corner of the hospital — from inpatient care and family medicine to forensic nursing and referral management.

Boone began her time at BJACH in the Progressive Care Unit, a high-acuity inpatient ward that managed telemetry patients and post-operative recoveries. She later supported the transition of the Family Medicine Clinic to a Patient-Centered Medical Home model, served as a virtual health care coordinator, and worked in the Soldier Centered Medical Home.

Today, she serves as a nurse consultant in managed care, helping patients navigate complex referrals, TRICARE authorizations and specialty care through the civilian network. “You never know what burden someone is carrying when they call,” Boone said. “Sometimes it’s a medical issue, sometimes it’s something more personal. When they reach me, they can rest assured they’re talking to someone who will advocate for them.”

In addition to her primary duties, Boone is one of three certified Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners at BJACH. Over the past several years, she has devoted more than 1,600 hours of on-call time, providing professional, compassionate care to individuals impacted by sexual assault and mentoring new forensic nurses across the installation. “It’s one of the most meaningful roles I’ve ever had,” she said. “From the moment they walk into the ER, we’re with them — making sure they’re supported, respected and never alone.”

Her commitment extends beyond any one department. Boone frequently steps in to assist during staff shortages across BJACH — in the emergency room, labor and delivery, family medicine and more. “Cyndi goes above and beyond to ensure patient care remains a top priority,” said Sabrina Cobb, Boone’s supervisor. “She mentors others, supports mission readiness, and leads by example — all without ever asking for recognition.”

Boone said her approach to nursing has always been rooted in service. “I’ve got a servant’s heart,” she said. “That’s just who I am. You treat people the way you’d want your family to be treated.”

Whether supporting a patient through a challenging diagnosis or helping a new nurse learn the ropes, Boone said she feels honored to serve the Fort Polk community. “As long as I’m able, I’ll keep doing what I can to help,” she said. “I’m grateful to be here — and grateful to be part of a team that cares this deeply.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9182518.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-17 12:56:59.886496

As we look to the future, I am committed to building upon the strong foundation laid by those who came before me,” he said. “We will continue to foster a culture of scientific rigor, innovation, and teamwork. We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community. Above all, we will never lose sight of our mission,” Summers concluded.

Lodi said Hoefer “is recognized for his calmness under pressure and his forward-thinking management style, as well as his ability to unite diverse teams. Your ability to drive progress will be an asset in your upcoming assignments” Lodi said.

“This lab’s future is bright because of your focus on delivering whatever the DOD needs to make our warriors safer, more lethal and more capable on the battlefield,” Hoefer said in a farewell message to USAARL. “Keep innovating, keep looking for new ways to support our teammates, and keep up this great USAARL culture.”

Hoefer asked the USAARL staff to stand for a moment during the ceremony. “Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff.

“Your work has been essential for aviators over the past 60 years and I’m excited to see what you deliver for Army aviation in the future,” Hoefer said.
