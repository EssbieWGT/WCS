I got claim numbers from the providers and asked Tricare about them and they said they had no record of them.

We added one of the providers onto the call, and discovered that Tricare has switched their claims center from Wisconsin to South Carolina. My provider was unaware and had mailed my claim to Wisconsin. If anyone else in the east region is having a similar issue, I can provide the new address, fax number, and payer ID that your provider will need to submit a claim to the right location.

Thank you to whoever takes the time to read this. I've been having an absolutey awful time with Humana military/Tricare east this year, after 3 previous years with no trouble.

I have 3 providers after me for a combined total of 30,000 in medical bills that should be Tricare's responsibility. Two of these are providers I have been seeing for years with no issues.

I talk to their billing departments and go over how the claim was submitted, making sure they use my correct benefits number and other personal info. They resubmit the claims, and Tricare comes back and says something to the effect of ""patient could not be identified as ours"".

So I call Tricare. They are adamant that I am insured, evidenced by the claims that have been approved this year, some from the same providers on the same day as the one that are getting denied. They saiy it is an issue with how the providers are submitting the claim.

I can see the approved claims in my EOB, but the denied claims don't show up at all. I got claim numbers from the providers and asked Tricare about them and they said they had no record of them.

The providers are adamant that the claims are submitted correctly. One even offered to go on a 3 way call with me to try to get it straightened out. When I told the Tricare rep I wanted to do that she said that wasn't allowed and they could only talk to provider claims.

Now I feel backed into a corner with no idea what to do next and terrified these bills will fall on me. What can I do next at this point in the process?

I haven't been sent to collections yet but one of the providers is starting to get a little more aggressive.",,N,-1,56:37.1
